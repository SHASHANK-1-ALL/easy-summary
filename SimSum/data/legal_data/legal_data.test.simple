The Karnataka High Court has said that the magistrates while rejecting a B-summary report filed by the police in a given case should record reasons. Such reasons, it said, need not be elaborate but must bear application of mind.
 Justice M. Nagaprasanna said "Application of judicious mind is demonstrable only in the order the learned Magistrate would make, for the order to demonstrate application of mind it must contain reasons, as recording of reasons is the only way that one can construe such application of mind."
 It added,
 "Reasons are the live links between the mind of the decision taker, to the controversy in question and the decision arrived at. Reason and application of mind are impregnable for a judicial order to sustain the scrutiny of law. Reasons in every circumstance need not be elaborate, but nevertheless should bear application of mind."

Background
 The Petitioner in this case was aggrieved by the rejection of B-summary report filed by the Police before Judicial Magistrate. He was booked for the offence of criminal intimidation under Section 506 IPC. The case emanates from a complaint filed by one Manjunath BP, whose property was purchased by the Petitioner in an auction for default of payment.
 According to the complainant, the petitioner had threatened him not to interfere with the auction proceedings, which was already over. Thus, a private complaint alleging offence punishable under Section 506 of the IPC was filed and an investigation was ordered. The police, after conducting an investigation, filed a 'B' report. The complainant filed a protest petition against acceptance of 'B' report under Section 200 of the CrPC The Magistrate recorded the sworn statement of the complainant and on perusal of the report, directed registration of criminal case against the petitioner and issued summons. 
The petitioner sought to quash this order before the high court.
 Advocate KN Nitish, appearing for the petitioner, contended that the entire allegation against the petitioner would not make out an offence punishable under Section 506 of the IPC. He claimed that complaint was filed only because the Petitioner had purchased the property belonging to the complainant. Moreover, it was claimed that the Magistrate, while rejecting 'B' report and directing registration of the criminal case, did not apply his mind with regard to the offence alleged.
 Advocate BG Namitha Mahesh, argued "Since the Police have conducted investigation and the Court has not accepted the 'B' report, it is a matter for trial and the learned Magistrate at this stage need not apply his mind as everything would be at large in the trial."
 Findings
 On going through the facts of the case the court said, 
"The aforesaid sequence of events would clearly indicate that the 2nd respondent, a disgruntled owner of the property having lost the property in the auction, wanted to teach a lesson to the auction purchaser i.e., the petitioner and accordingly, registers a bald complaint alleging offence punishable under Section 506 of the IPC."
 Further, the court said "If the complaint is seen qua Section 506 of the IPC, it does not link any action of the petitioner to Section 503 of the IPC, for an offence punishable under Section 506 of the IPC."
 It added "It is only because the petitioner was the auction purchaser of the property, though, through legal means, the complaint is registered by the complainant. Therefore, there cannot be a better case of giving a criminal colour to a legal act of the Corporation."
 On considering the order passed by the magistrate, the court said,
 "A cursory perusal of the order would indicate blatant non-application of mind on the part of the learned Magistrate. All that the learned Magistrate would indicate is that, on a perusal of oral sworn statement of the complainant and documentary evidence coupled with complaint averments, in the opinion of the learned Magistrate, because it prima facie disclosed a case against the accused for the offence punishable under Section 506 of the IPC, directs registration of a criminal case and issued summons, thereby the learned Magistrate takes cognizance, under Section 191(1)(b) of the Cr.P.C. and sets the criminal trial in motion."
 Justice Nagaprasanna observed,
"The order that sets criminal trial in motion by taking cognizance under Section 191(1)(b) of the Cr.P.C. should bear the stamp of application of mind, more so, in the cases like the subject petition, where an investigation is ordered on the complaint registered under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C. and a final report is filed by the Police after investigation." It added, "Setting the criminal trial in motion cannot become a matter of course or done as a routine exercise."
 Further it said,
 "Merely because a complainant files a protest petition and gives a statement with regard to his protest petition, the learned Magistrate ought not be swayed away by such a protest petition. It is incumbent upon the learned Magistrate to consider 'B' report, protest petition and the evidence on record and record his finding as to why he rejects the 'B' report and accepts the protest petition."
 The court also pointed that,
 "In the present case the allegation against the petitioner being a non- cognizable offence punishable under Section 506 of the IPC, the procedure under Section 155 of the Cr.P.C, ought to have been followed by the police. The registration of FIR could not have been done by the Police without at the outset referring the matter to the learned Magistrate."
 Mushrooming of Registration of Criminal Cases
 The court took note about the mushrooming of registration of criminal cases by the handiwork of certain disgruntled complainants, as is found in the case at hand. Referring to the Apex Court's order in the case of Chandrapal Singh And Others V. Maharaj Singh And Another, it said "The learned Magistrate before whom the proceedings are instituted must have exercised care and caution while taking cognizance of the allegation of such offence."
 The court concluded by saying,
 "In the normal circumstance, when the order taking cognizance bears the stamp of non-application of mind, the matter could be remitted back to the learned Magistrate for consideration afresh. In the peculiar facts of this case, where there is an error even in the registration of FIR and the complaint itself not linking even to the remotest sense to the offence alleged, I deem it appropriate not to remit the matter back to the hands of the Magistrate for consideration afresh."
 Case Title: Nagaraj Rao C.H. v. State By Its S.P.P. Bangalore

Observing that it is the 'absolute domain' of the Ministry of Defence to decide the opening or closing of the road which falls in the defence area, the Gujarat High Court has refused to grant relief to the Petitioners complaining that blocking of a road by the defence authorities was causing them hardship in approaching their society / homes.
"...It is for the army authorities to determine which area is sensitive or more prone to such hazard or which is not or through which a passage can be permitted or not and it is their sole discretion and in absence of any right of any party, a mandate cannot be issued."
The Petitioners averred that the authorities had unauthorizedly and illegally blocked the road. They referred to a policy decision of the Ministry of Defence dated 21.05.2018, seeking the opening of the road. Reference was also made to the Standard of Procedure letter of 2018 to contest that all roads which were situated in the cantonment area were required to be opened and they could be closed in certain contingencies only after inviting public opinions. Further reliance was placed on a communication of 2018 by the respondent authorities wherein the bullock cart road which was closed for civilian public was directed to be opened.
The Petitioners had earlier approached the High Court and the Court had passed an interim order for lifting the barricades and opening the road. However, the Division Bench set aside this interim order of the Coordinate Bench.
 The Petitioners submitted that per Sec 258 of the Cantonment Act, 2006, the street within the cantonment area could not be closed for reasons other than the security reasons without inviting public opinion. The concerned street was a Nala (sewer) which had been converted into a Kaccha track in approaching the Sabarmati river for use as a bullock cart road. It was initially used as firing range and later due to growth of residents, it was used as a street. 
Per contra, the Respondent authorities submitted that the SoP will not apply since the land in question belongs to the defence and the road cannot be opened. Per the Cantonment and Administration Rules, 1947, the land in question was specifically reserved for military purposes. The land could not be used for any purpose whether a Kaccha or a constructed road which was reserved for exclusive and absolute use for armed forces only.
 Justice AS Supehia noted that the Division Bench had struck down the interim order while noting that the land was Class A-1 land of the Army and it was not the only space providing ingress and egress to the Petitioners. The High Court also observed that the Petitioners had also failed to show any right over the property of any nature. The land was being used for the purpose of fortification, barrack stores, arsenals, aerodromes, bungalows etc. 
Finally, the Bench opined that it was open for the army to determine which area was sensitive or more prone to such hazard or which passage could be permitted or not. "Hence, this Court is not inclined to grant any relief to the petitioners, as it is in the absolute domain of the respondent authorities to exercise their discretion with regard to opening or closing of the road which falls in the defence area," the order stated.

The Supreme Court on Monday appointed a committee to conduct local inspection with regard to the quality and quantity of water released by the state of Haryana at Balla (upstream of the Yamuna river in Delhi), the level of the Wazirabad bank and whether the Delhi government is diverting the water to the Water Treatment Plants at Wazirabad, Chandrawal and Okhla before the water reaches the Wazirabad bank.
The bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian was hearing a writ petition by the Delhi Jal Board
 seeking appropriate directions to the state of Haryana over discharge of untreated pollutants, in view of the increased concentration of ammonia in the river water of Yamuna. It has been prayed that the Court ensure that enough water is supplied to the NCT of Delhi, at a level of 674.503 feet, in pursuance of the Supreme Court decision in the 1996 case of Delhi Water Supply, to ensure that the high concentration of ammonia in the water is diluted.
In view of the urgency of the matter, the bench required the committee to conduct the inspection  within three days time and to submit a report to the court within three days. The matter will now be heard by the court on Friday.
The bench noted that the DJB is complaining of the water level being 664 feet instead of 674 feet. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, for the DJB, submitted that the reduction in the supply of water by the state of Haryana has led to the increase of ammonia in the water leading to health problems. Senior counsel Pururshaindra Kaurav, for the state of Haryana, submitted that the Upper Yamuna River Board has carried out an inspection and submitted a report in 2017, which shows that the water being supplied was up to the level of 670.7 above the river bank. He argued that there has to be a diversion of water to the water treatment plants before it reaches the riverbank.
"Before entering into the merits of the matter, we did deem it fit and proper that a committee should be appointed to conduct local inspection within a period of three days as regards the following: (1) the quality and quantity of water being released by Haryana at Palla, (2) the level of the Wazirabad bank and (3) whether the Delhi government is diverting the water to the water treatment plants at Wazirabad, Okhla and Chandrawal before the water reaches the Wazirabad bank ", said the bench.
The committee constituted by the court is to comprise the Secretary, Delhi Jal Shakti Ministry, who shall be the chairman of the committee, and representatives of the Delhi Pollution Control Board, the Delhi Jal Board, the Haryana Pollution Control Board and the Haryana Irrigation Department.

The Fast Track Special Court (POCSO), Thiruvananthapuram has convicted a 63 year old man to 7 years imprisonment under the Section 9(m) r/w 10 of the POCSO Act, 2012 for sexually assaulting his 9 year old neighbour in the year 2014.
The incident was disclosed 6 years later when the victim confided in her school counsellor. The Court found the delay of 6 years in registration of the FIR had been satisfactorily explained by the prosecution, and accepted the same. 
"Researches and studies show that there are numerous reasons why a child or even a grown up adult may not disclose about a sexual assault and it may linger at the bottom of their heart as their dirty, scary secret, but they open up or disclose it to someone they find they can confide in or someone whom they trust will listen to them and not judge them etc. In the instant case, according to PW1 she was afraid of the incident and also not aware of the nature of the event that occurred to her. Her subsequent reluctance to visit the house of the accused also shows that she had distanced herself from (the accused) after the incident, which unfortunately her parents failed to notice earlier. Many such factors contribute to non-disclosure of sexual assault by children", the Special Judge Aaj Sudarshan observed while convicting the accused.
It therefore ascertained that the delay of 6 years in lodging the FIR could not be considered as fatal to the prosecution when the victim had explained the reasons which had also acquired the confidence of the Court. 
The Prosecution case was that the accused had sexually assaulted the victim when she was 9 years old, and residing with her grandparents. The accused was the victim's neighbour, and his family was to the family of the victim. The incident allegedly took place when the victim had sought the help of the neighbours including that of the accused on the instructions of her grandmother, after her grandfather developed discomfort in the chest. The accused had instructed his wife to take the victim to their house when the latter's grandfather was taken to the hospital, and it was there that the assault took place. 
The incident came to light when the victim disclosed the event to her school counsellor, after her mother took her for counselling on January 6, 2020, due to her exhibiting behavioural disorders, laziness, lack of interest in studying, loss of appetite, and so on. 
It was submitted by the Public Prosecutor R.S. Vijay Mohan that after the incident, the accused used to run away whenever he saw the victim, which was indicative of his guilt or shame. "The reason given by PW1 that she was afraid to disclose the incident to anyone soon after the incident can be because of many factors as understood from the evidence adduced like, the close relationship of her family with the family of the accused, she was residing with aged grandparents and not with her parents which must have resulted in mental agony to a small child of 9 years while her brother got to live with her parents, living with grandparents and living away from parents must have created an emotional and mental distance in her mind with her parents, non-awareness of what actually took place on the night of 01/01/2014, her fear on re-visiting the incident which she described as near death experience, lack of close friends at school, and so on", it was further submitted. 
It was argued by the defense counsel Advocate Biju S.S. that it was a false case preferred on the instigation of the maternal aunt of the victim. It was contended that there had been a civil dispute with respect to a pathway between her maternal aunt and the accused. It was argued that otherwise, the victim, who was a brilliant and bright child who had come to know about sexual abuse while studying in Class 4 would have disclosed the same when it had occurred. It was thus contended that the accused had been falsely implicated in this case. 
The Court in this case was of the opinion that the delay of 6 years in registration of FIR had been well explained by the prosecution in the circumstances. 
"...it is to be borne in mind that no girl wishes to falsely implicate a man in a case stating that the man had sexually assaulted her. The delay in disclosing the unfortunate event to anyone causing delay of 6 years in registering Ext P18 FIR is well explained by PW1", it observed. 
The Court also relied on the Apex Court decision in Tulsidas Kanolkar v. State of Goa (2003), to emphasize that delay in lodging the FIR cannot be used as a ritualistic formula for discarding the prosecution case and doubting its authenticity. 
"In the instant case, PW1 was afraid to disclose the incident and was also unaware of the catastrophe which had befallen on her. So, the delay in lodging Ext P18 FIR does not in any way render the prosecution version brittle", it held. 
The Court further took note of the victim's statement that she was unaware of any civil dispute between her maternal aunt and the accused. 
"That apart, it may be noted that hardly any family member would fit a person in a POCSO case to take revenge by risking the future and honour of their child. Not all people are hard hearted to bring dishonour to their child. Life of a female child ends when a false accusation is levelled by her against a person only to take revenge on him", the Court observed. 
Having found that the prosecution had thus proved the sexual assault through the evidences submitted, the Court thus convicted the accused. It sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 7 years and to pay a fine of Rs.25,000/-. In default of payment of the fine amount, the accused was directed to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a term of 6 months. The Court added that in case the fine amount was realized, it would have to be be given to the victim as compensation. 
"The accused is entitled to get set off on the substantive sentence for the period from 23/01/2020 till 11/02/2020 the period he had undergone detention as an under trial prisoner", it added.

The Allahabad High Court has allowed the state government's application to withdraw a criminal case against Uttar Pradesh Minister of State for Health, Mayankeswar Saran Singh.
The Bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh observed that when the complainant himself is not supporting the prosecution case, then there is no chance of conviction of the accused in the case and thus, withdrawal from prosecution would be in the interest of justice. 
With this, the Court allowed a revision application filed by the State Government challenging the order passed by the Special Judge/M.P./M.L.A./ VI-Additional Sessions Judge, Raebareli in 2020 wherein it had dismissed the plea moved by the Public Prosecutor for withdrawal from prosecution.
The case in brief
Essentially, the matter dates back to the year 2007, when, during the assembly elections, Mayankeshwar Sharan Singh (the then MLA and Minister) was contesting as a Samajwadi Party Candidate against his rival candidate, Bahujan Samaj Party's Dinesh Pratap Singh. 
A supporter of Dinesh had lodged an FIR against Mayankeshwar and about 20 of his people under Sections 147, 148, 149, 307, 436, 397, 395, 323, 504, 506, 427 IPC and 2(3) U.P. Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act alleging that he along with 20-25 people had sprinkled petrol on the house of the complainant and set it on fire
After an investigation into the case, the police filed the charge sheet, upon which the court summoned all the accused after taking cognizance on July 13, 2009. However, in 2019, the state government decided to withdraw the case, but, PP's application filed under Section 321 CrPC [Withdrawal from prosecution] was dismissed by the MP MLA Court.
Court's observations
At the outset, the Court noted that the Public Prosecutor had filed the application under Section 321 Cr.P.C. in good faith after careful consideration of the material available on record. 
The Court also noted that the FIR in the instant matter got registered because of political rivalry and that, later on, the complainant himself had submitted an application before the trial Court that he had no objection if the application is allowed, and his earlier objection on application under Section 321 Cr.P.C. for withdrawal from prosecution be ignored.
In view of this, observing that it would be appropriate to allow the application for withdrawal from prosecution, the Court remarked thus:
"The Court is required to consider whether withdrawal from prosecution would further cause of justice or not and whether it would be in the public interest to allow the withdrawal from prosecution. When the complainant himself is not supporting the prosecution case, this Court is of the view that there is no chance of conviction of the accused in the case. The case has been remained pending since 2007 and continuance of trial would be nothing but a futile exercise and Court's precious time would get wasted for futile exercise, if the application for withdrawal from prosecution is not allowed."
In view thereof, the Court said that the view taken by the Special Judge does not appear to be the correct view, and therefore, allowing the revision, the Court also allowed the application for withdrawal from prosecution.

The Karnataka High Court has said that the state government order, providing that in case eligible women applicants under a reserved category post are not available, such posts could be filled up by eligible male candidates of the same category is applicable to recruitment notifications issued under the General Recruitment Rules or recruitment as regards backlog vacancies under the Special Recruitment Rules. 
A single judge bench of Justice S Sunil Dutt Yadav allowed the petition filed by Dyavappa, and directed the Bangalore University to take note of the Government Order dated 22-11-2002 and proceed forthwith to make an order of appointment. The said process is to be completed within a period of three months. 
 The University had invited applications for recruitment as per the Notification dated 21.03.2018. Insofar as recruitment to the Open category is concerned, recruitment was completed. However, the recruitment for the category of ST (W) could not be concluded as no candidates had applied for the post earmarked for the particular category. 
 The petitioner came to know regarding non-submission of application with respect to the post of Assistant Professor (Women) under the category of ST by virtue of the communication of the Bangalore University and soon thereafter he made a representation for appointment to the said post. 
 Following which he approached the court seeking directions to the University to consider the representation made by him and direct the respondents to issue an order of appointment to the post of Assistant Professor, Department of Architecture in Bangalore University as regards the vacant post under the category ST (Women). 
 Senior Advocate A.G.Shivanna appearing for the petitioner submitted that subsequent notification by the University does not make any provision for filling of this post as notified on 14.06.2021. In terms of Section 53 (8) of the Karnataka State Universities Act, the Board of appointment shall follow the orders issued by the State Government from time to time and the GO must be construed to be an order issued by the State Government in terms of Section 53 (8) of the Karnataka State Universities Act. 
 Further, he argued that the vertical reservation is the category of ST while the horizontal reservation is that of woman and taking note of the applicable Government Order, in the event suitable woman candidate as regards vertical reservation of ST is not found, in terms of the Government Order, if the horizontal reservation is shifted to the men, there would be no prejudice that would be caused to the vertical reservation.
 The government advocate said the Order dated 22.11.2002, is required to be adhered to by the appointing authority 'in all the cadres'. Further, sub-rule (1B) of Rule 9 of the Karnataka Civil Service (General Recruitment) Rules, 1977, points out that vacancies set apart to the extent of 33% shall be filled up from amongst the category of General Merit, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and each of the categories among the other backward classes by women. The said Recruitment Rule has a proviso which states that if sufficient number of eligible women candidates are not available, to the extent of thirty-three percent, the unfilled vacancies shall be filled by men candidates belonging to the same category. 
 Advocate Rajendrakumar Sungay appearing for the University contended that the Government Order is not applicable insofar as the present recruitment notification is in terms of the Karnataka State Civil Services (Unfilled vacancies reserved for the persons belonging to the Scheduled castes and the Scheduled tribes) (Special Recruitment) Rules, 2001 and also the Karnataka State Civil Services (Unfilled vacancies reserved for the persons belonging to the Scheduled castes and the Scheduled Tribes) (Special Recruitment) (First Amendment) Rules 2002. 
 Findings
 The bench said, 
"As per Recruitment Notification the post of Assistant Professor of Department of Architecture is to be filled up under the main Category of vertical reservation of Scheduled Tribe (ST) and horizontal reservation as regards one post with respect to women and the other post is reserved 'Open' for the same category. It is accordingly to be construed that the vertical reservation is of ST while horizontal reservation is as regards category of women." 
 It added, 
"The Government Order as rightly contended by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner is to be treated to be a direction of the State Government under Section 53 (8) of the Karnataka State Universities Act, 2000." 
 Rejecting the contention of the University that the Government Order is not applicable insofar as recruitment under the Special Recruitment Rules is concerned, the bench said, 
"The Government Order does not make any such distinction and would be applicable whether it is recruitment under the General Recruitment Rules or Recruitment as regards backlog vacancies under the Special Recruitment Rules. The direction under the notification at Annexure-'H' being a direction under Section 53 (8) requires to be accepted by the University." 
 Further the court said recruitment to other posts having been completed and as contended by the petitioner a subsequent notification for recruitment also having been made, there is no notification for recruitment as regards category of ST (Women). 
 Following which it said ,
"If that being so, non-filling of the post for ST under the vertical reservation of ST by other eligible women or in the absence by men would prejudice the rights of those under ST Category. Wherever the horizontal reservation of eligible candidates are not found and as provided under the recruitment Rule 9 (b) referred to above as well as Government Order at Annexure-'H', it is the duty of the authorities concerned to then have a vertical reservation filled in terms of the Government Order by ST (Women)."

The Delhi High Court on Friday granted bail to Preet Singh, accused in connection with the alleged inflammatory and anti-Muslim sloganeering at Jantar Mantar.
Justice Mukta Gupta pronounced the order after reserving it earlier this month on hearing Advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain appearing for accused Singh and Tarang Srivastava appearing for the Prosecution.
Singh is the President of Save India Foundation and is alleged to be the co-­organizer of the event where the inflammatory slogans were shouted. His bail was rejected by a Sessions Court on August 27 after observing that he was clearly seen, actively participating in the incendiary speeches along with other associates.
During the course of his bail hearing, Jain had submitted that an hostile point of view, even if the same is extreme, cannot attract Section 153A of IPC unless enmity is promoted between different religious groups.
Refuting the prosecution's argument that the event was organized for the purpose of demanding a Hindu Rashtra, Jain submitted that the meeting was for demanding uniformity in laws, such as one nation one tax, one civil code, one health code etc. He also apprised the Court that people were dispersed after the Police had objected that the meeting was being conducted without due permission. 
Relying on the status report filed by the Prosecution, Jain submitted that the same does not reflect even a single averment showing that Preet Singh committed any of the offence as alleged in the matter. He also submitted that Singh was not present at the event when the alleged sloganeering happened.
"With all due respect, If my ladyship holds that demand of Hindu rashtra in a democratic setup comes within the purview of sec. 153A IPC, then I will not press my bail application," Jain had submitted.
Refuting this, Srivastava submitted that the judgment has no relevance in the case in hand as there has been clear comments made against a community by accused persons.
Srivastava also relied on transcripts including videos showing people chanting slogans against people from a particular community.
"It is not criticism. It's not about freedom of speech & expression. They are incendiary comments to insult a particular community," Srivastava had submitted.
Videos of mob at the gathering shouting slogans openly calling for the killing of Muslims had emerged on Sunday. Lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay, who has now been granted bail by the Court, claimed that the slogans were raised after the meeting organized by him was over. He had organized a meeting calling for the repeal of "colonial-era laws".
Singh was booked under Sections 188 (Disobedience to public servant's order), 269-270 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life), 153­A (Promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, etc.), 120­B (Criminal conspiracy) and 34 of IPC.
Rejecting his bail plea, the Sessions Court had observed:
"That prima facie on the basis of the material placed on record and the submissions put forth by the prosecution, it is observed that there has been active participation by the applicant in his individual capacity and also as the main organizer of the event itself which was conducted at Jantar Mantar in spite of the denial of permission by the Delhi Police and total disregard to Covid­19 protocol issued by the Govt. of India."
A Court had granted bail to former Delhi BJP Spokesperson and Supreme Court Lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay, who was arrested and remanded to two days judicial custody in the matter.
Case Title: Preet Singh v. State

Punjab and Haryana High Court recently came across a case where the original order of conviction passed by the Trial Court was modified under the signature of the Reader of the Court, during the pendency of an appeal preferred by the convict against the said judgment, thereby enhancing the sentence of the convict from 2 months to two years.
 The bench comprising Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan noted that all the convicts were originally convicted under section 323/326/120-B IPC read with section 149 IPC. However, due to a typographical mistake, offence under Section 323 was mentioned twice and offence under Section 326 IPC was not mentioned in the column of conviction. Accordingly, the trial court resorted the provisions of section 362 CrPC as per which, a clerical or arithmetical error can be corrected.
However, it was brought to the Court's attention that in the corrections made in the original order, which was signed by the Magistrate, the sentence was enhanced to rigorous imprisonment for 2 years. This was done under the signatures of Reader of the Court and not the Magistrate.
The Petitioner argued that once the Judicial Magistrate has passed the order on sentence, the corrections in the original judgment, if any, was to be done under the signatures of the Judicial Magistrate only, though it will be a debatable issue whether subsequent to passing of any judgment, the same Judicial Magistrate can enhance the sentence from 02 months to 02 years.
Therefore, the instant petition was moved for setting aside the order whereby during the pendency of the appeal, the judgment passed by the trial Court, was amended and modified.
 The court in this case held that it requires an inquiry to know as to how the corrections were made under the signatures of the Reader of the Court concerned, thereby enhancing the sentence, though, in the original order, it was only directed to correct the typographical mistake.
 Though all these points need to be decided by the Sessions Judge, Tarn Taran, who herself is administrative head of the Sessions Division, Tarn Taran and on the face of it, it requires an inquiry as to how the corrections were made under the signatures of the Reader of the Court concerned, thereby enhancing the sentence, though in the original order, passed by the trial Court, it was only directed that instead of Section 323 IPC, which is mentioned at two places, Section 326 IPC be substituted at one place and there was no such direction to enhance the sentence from 02 months to 02 years.
 Therefore, keeping in view the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it is directed that the lower appellate Court will allow the amendment in the grounds of appeal assailing to the aforesaid order and after conducting an inquiry on the administrative side will decide the appeal in accordance with the law.
 Court finally concluded that while deciding the appeal, the lower appellate Court will also record the findings on whether in terms of Section 362 Cr.P.C., such modification was permissible under law or not. Hence, Prayer in this petition stands amended and modified.
 Case Title : Gurmahabir Singh v. State of Punjab

The Kerala High Court recently said that when an original petition is converted to a suit as contemplated under Rule 26 of the Indian Succession Rules (Kerala), 1968, the court fee has to be paid under Article 11 (k) of Schedule II of the Court Fees Act. 
A trial court had earlier directed a plaintiff to pay court fees under Section 25(a) of the Act read with Article 1 Schedule I of the Court Fees Act, even after conversion of original petition to suit. However, Justice C.S. Dias said the same is incorrect and wrong.
The court said Chapter VI of the Kerala Court-Fees and Suits Valuation Act, 1959 deals with the manner in which court fee is to be computed and paid on applications filed for probate, letter of administration and certificate of administration.
"The above provisions clearly specify that whenever an application for the grant of probate or letters of administration is filed, the same has to be accompanied by a valuation statement of the estate in the form set forth in Part I of Schedule III of the Court Fees Act, and court fee is to be paid under Article 6 of Schedule I of the Court Fees Act," it added.
However, the court added that whenever there is a contest, the court fee is to be paid under Article 11 (k) of Schedule II of the Court Fees Act. 
"So, in an uncontested application falling under Section 56 of the Court Fees Act, the court fee is to be paid under Article 6 of Schedule I of the Act and in a contested application, the court fee is to be paid under Article 11 (k) of Schedule II of the Act, i.e., one half of the scale of fees prescribed under Article 1 of Schedule I of the Court Fees Act".
Senior Advocate N.N. Sugunapalan and Advocate S. Sujin appeared on behalf of the petitioners. The respondents were represented by Advocates Legith T. Kottakkal and Kodoth Sreedharan.

In a noteworthy judgment, the Kerala High Court on Wednesday made several important observations on matrimonial cruelty and the scope of revival of condoned matrimonial offences. 
A Division Bench comprising Justice A. Muhamed Mustaque and Justice Sophy Thomas dismissed an appeal filed by a woman seeking to reverse the order of a Family Court which rejected her plea for divorce finding that she had failed to prove any form of matrimonial cruelty allegedly meted out on her.
"It is true that in order to attract 'cruelty' in matrimonial life, there is no need of any physical violence. Cruelty can be either mental or physical. But when there is specific allegations of physical cruelty, the person alleging the same is bound to prove it."
The Court added that when the other party is vehemently opposing the allegations levelled against him, some sort of cogent evidence is expected, especially when there was every opportunity to adduce the same.
It further held,
"The period of non-co-habitation however long it may be, if it was due to deliberate avoidance or due to pendency of cases filed by one party, the other party cannot be found fault with, when the other party is still ready to continue his/her matrimonial life, and no grounds recognized by law are established against the other party to break their nuptial tie. So legally, one party cannot unilaterally decide to walk out of a marriage, when sufficient grounds are not there justifying a divorce, under the law which governs them, saying that due to non-co-habitation for a considerable long period, their marriage is dead practically and emotionally."
Other important findings in the case: 
1. Concept of cruelty differs from person to person; a few isolated instances over a period of years will not amount to cruelty. 
2. When spouses are incapable to arrive at a consensus for dissolving their marriage, the Court can only go by the law and procedure. Their marriage can only be dissolved if they satisfy the statutory requirements.
3. A family is an amalgamation of distinct individual interests; it is difficult to define and demarcate the rights and duties of husband and wife in matrimonial life. 
4. No matrimonial offence is erased by condonation; it can revive and give rise to a cause of action for dissolution of marriage if the offending spouse takes unfair advantage of the benevolence shown by the wronged spouse and takes to matrimonial misdeeds again.
5. Long period of non-co-habitation due to deliberate avoidance or pendency of cases filed by one party is not a ground for divorce when the other party cannot be found fault with and is ready to continue the matrimonial life.
Background: 
The appeal was filed by a woman challenging the degree of a Family Court rejecting her prayer for divorce. 
According to the appellant, during her 12 year long stay at the matrimonial home, she was subjected to matrimonial cruelty by her husband and her in-laws in the name of dowry. She alleged that she was not permitted to pursue her higher studies and was neglected by her husband. 
The appellant contended that when her father tried to enquire about the cruelty, she was asked to vacate the matrimonial house. Thereafter, she has been living separately in a flat since 2011.
According to her, pursuant to intervention by their friends and family, the respondent also joined her at the flat soon. However, within a month, he allegedly left the flat threatening to take away their son from her. 
Thereafter she filed for divorce, return of gold ornaments, custody of the child, and also a petition under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act against him.
Nevertheless, again after persuasion from her family and friends, she agreed to a reunion and withdrew all the cases. The respondent started living with her again from 2015 onwards. 
It is the case of the appellant that even after this reunion, there was no mental unity or physical intimacy between them and that now they have been living separately for two years. She argued that their marriage was irretrievably broken. 
Accordingly, she moved the Family Court for a divorce on the ground of cruelty, but this was dismissed. Aggrieved by the same, she reached the High Court. 
Appearing for the appellant, Senior Advocate Sumathy Dandapani assisted by Advocate Millu Dandapani argued that though the cruelties alleged in the earlier divorce petition was condoned, since the respondent continued his ill-treatment towards her, it will revive and that she is entitled to get a decree of divorce on the grounds urged in the earlier petition as well.
Advocates Dinesh R. Shenoy and A. Joseph George appeared for the respondent and denied all the allegations. 
Significant Findings: 
No Proof Of Matrimonial Cruelty
The Court found the following contradictions in her version: 
1) Although she had alleged in her plea that she was asked to vacate the residence, according to her testimony, she shifted to a flat due to constant abuse from the respondent and his parents. 
2) She said her father had tried to intervene in the matter, but he was not examined despite being the best witness to speak about unlawful demand for dowry. There was nothing on record to show that she was forcefully evicted. 
3) No complaints have been filed during 1999-2011, her 12 year-long stay at the matrimonial residence alleging cruelty. 
4) Contrary to her allegation, her testimony disclosed that she completed her M.A and thereafter acquired Ph.D after her marriage. In fact, in her Ph.D thesis, she has specifically thanked her in-laws and her husband for the support they rendered for her higher studies. 
5) The appellant admitted to having attended classes for music, painting, driving, dance, computer, fashion designing and compering during her stay in her matrimonial home. She was compering in two channels as well. This convinced the court that she had freedom at her matrimonial home for her academic as well as extra-curricular activities and 'there was every opportunity for her to blossom into an all-rounder'.
6) During evidence, the appellant frequently alleged that she was ill-treated by the respondent physically and mentally. However, not even one incident of physical violence was pleaded by the appellant, and no evidence was produced to prove any such violence.
On these among other grounds, the Court found that the allegations of cruelty up to the first divorce plea in 2011 could not be proved by the appellant to reach a finding that it was injurious to continue with the respondent. Reunion in the year 2015 fortifies that fact, it was observed.  
Concept Of Cruelty Differs From Person To Person
As observed by the Apex Court in Samar Ghosh vs. Jaya Ghosh [(2007) 4 SCC 511], the human mind is extremely complex and human behaviour is equally complicated. The concept of cruelty differs from person to person depending upon his upbringing, level of sensitivity, educational, family and cultural background, financial position, social status, customs, traditions, religious beliefs, human values and their value system. 
However, the Supreme Court had clarified that mere coldness or lack of affection cannot amount to cruelty. It had further observed that mere trivial irritations, quarrels, normal wear and tear of the married life which happens in day to day life would not be adequate for grant of divorce on the ground of mental cruelty. 
"Married life should be reviewed as a whole and a few isolated instances over a period of years will not amount to cruelty."
Courts Bound To Follow Law When Spouses Have Conflicting Views
The appellant categorically deposed that she wanted to escape from this relationship and marry another man to lead a respectable and happy married life. 
Although her intention was appreciated, the Court noted that when spouses are incapable to arrive at a consensus for dissolving their marriage, it can only go by the law and procedure. The Bench added that only if they satisfy the statutory requirements can a court of law grant a decree of divorce to dissolve their marriage.
Further, the appellant had contended that their marriage was irretrievably broken and there is no chance for a reunion. However, irretrievable breakdown of marriage if at all it existed, is not a ground for divorce recognised by Hindu Law.
Moreover, when one spouse alleges an irretrievable breakdown of marriage, he/she has to plead and prove the grounds recognised by law that lead to such a breakdown. 
"If one spouse wants to avoid the other spouse without any justifiable reasons recognized by law and unilaterally takes a decision to break the marital tie, he/she may not get the legal sanction for that separation." 
Family An Amalgamation of Distinct Interests; Difficult To Demarcate Rights Of Spouses
The Court found that irrespective of caste and creed, marriage is an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually intimate and sexual, are acknowledged. 
"It is a socially or ritually recognized union or legal contract between spouses that establishes rights and obligations between them, between them and their children and between them and their in-laws. Sometimes a lot of sacrifice may be involved from either side to preserve the family and to protect the children."
The Bench added that family building demands surrender of individual autonomy in favour of mutual reliance and care. 
"A family is an amalgamation of distinct individual interests. It is difficult to define and demarcate the rights and duties of husband and wife in their matrimonial life...The mutual rights and obligations undertaken by the couple, forms the basis of their partnership in love, called family, which is the basic unit of the society. Mere trivial irritations, quarrels, normal wear and tear of married life which happens in day to day life may not destroy that institution. In the case in hand, as there is no evidence to prove the matrimonial cruelties or desertion alleged by the wife, her claim for divorce cannot sustain legally."
The Court further acknowledged that the delay in the justice delivery system may also be adding years to their separation.
"Long years of separation and the bitter battle fought in court with allegations and counter allegations may still keep them away, blocking their reunion. Even for very simple reasons, the spouses may break co-habitation, intending to mend the ways of the other spouse, expecting a re-union after clearing all their apprehensions. But the litigations once begun may take them to unknown shores, never intended at the beginning. That is why we could see a simple claim for maintenance or restitution ending up with divorce."
Condonation Of Matrimonial Offences & Their Revival
As observed by the Apex Court in Narayan Ganesh Dastane vs. Sucheta Narayan Dastane [1975 KHC 183], the condonation of a matrimonial offence is not to be likened to a full Presidential pardon under Art.72 of the Constitution which, once granted, wipes out the guilt beyond the possibility of revival. 
"No matrimonial offence is erased by condonation. It is obscured but not obliterated"
Similarly, in Santhosh Kumar S vs. Jayashree Damodaran [2020 (2) KHC 33], it was held that an act of cruelty once condoned can revive and give rise to a cause of action for dissolution of marriage, when the offending spouse exploits and takes unfair advantage of generosity or the benevolence shown by the wronged spouse and takes to matrimonial misdeeds over again. No wrong is permanently wiped out by condonation, but is only hibernated. 
However, in this case, the appellant had failed to prove matrimonial cruelty of any kind in her plea. And for the cruelty once condoned to be revived, there should be a repetition of matrimonial wrongs which amounts to cruelty.
Since nothing of this sort could be found in her plea or appeal, the Bench dismissed the appeal. 
Case Title: Dr. Uthara v. Dr. Sivapriyan

Supreme Court judge Justice BV Nagarathna, who penned a dissenting judgment to declare the 2016 demonetisation as illegal, opined that the Central Government could not have demonetised the whole series of bank notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 through a mere executive notification. The judge expressed the view that such a measure had to be carried out through a plenary legislation.
"Such demonetisation of currency notes at the instance of the Central Government cannot be by the issuance of an executive notification", said Justice Nagarathna. The judge held that the Government could not have invoked Section 26(2) of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 for this measure, as the power under Section 26(2) is only to withdraw bank notes of a particular series and not the entire currency notes of a denomination. 
In the judgment, Justice Nagarathna also made certain crucial observations regarding the importance of Parliamentary discussion.
Parliament is "nation in miniature", must be taken into confidence on crucial issues
"The Parliament which is the fulcrum in our democratic system of governance, must be taken into confidence. This is because it is the representative of the people of the Country. It is the pivot of any democratic country and in it rest the interests of the citizens of the Country. The Parliament enables its citizens to participate in the decision-making process of the government. A Parliament is often referred to as a “nation in miniature”; it is the basis for democracy. A Parliament provides representation to the people of a country and makes their voices heard. Without a Parliament, a democracy cannot thrive; every democratic country needs a Parliament for the smooth conduct of its governance and to give meaning to democracy in the true sense".
Parliament cannot be left aloof on crucial matters like demonetisation
"The Parliament which is at the centre of our democracy cannot be left aloof in a matter of such importance. Its views on the subject of demonetisation are critical and of utmost importance".
Discussion in Parliament on demonetisation would have given it legitimacy 
"On a matter as critical as demonetisation, having a bearing on nearly 86% of the total currency in circulation, the same could not have been carried out by way of issuance of an executive notification. A meaningful discussion and debate in the Parliament on the proposed measure, would have lent legitimacy to the exercise".
"When an Ordinance is issued or a Bill is introduced in the Parliament and enacted as a law, it would mean that it has been done by taking into confidence the Members of Parliament who are the representatives of the people of India, who would meaningfully discuss on the proposal for demonetisation made by the Central Government. In such an event, demonetisation would be by an Act of Parliament and not a measure carried out by the issuance of a gazette notification by the CentralGovernment in exercise of its executive power".
"When the process of demonetisation is carried out through a Parliamentary enactment and after being the subject of scrutiny by the Members of Parliament, any opinion sought by the Central Government from the Central Board of the Bank before initiating the promulgation of the Ordinance or placing the Bill before the Parliament may also be additional material which could be considered by the Parliament. When the Central Government initiates the proposal for demonetisation and thereafter consults the Bank on such proposal, then it could be said that the necessary safeguards were taken, as the Central Government would be fortified in its proposal for demonetisation having taken the advice of not only an expert body but the highest financial authority in the country, which handles not only the monetary policy but is also the sole authority vested with the power of issuance of bank notes or currency notes in India. When the Central Government proposes to demonetise the currency notes, not only the view of the Central Board of the Bank is relevant and important but also that of the representatives of the people in the Parliament. The Members of the Parliament hold the sovereign powers of “We, the People of India” in trust".
Demonetisation illegal, but no relief can be granted
Justice Nagarathna declared the notification dated November 8, 2016 to be "contrary to law" and "unlawful".
"In the circumstances, the action of demonetisation of all currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 is vitiated. Further, the subsequent Ordinance of 2016 and the Act of 2017, incorporating the terms of the impugned notification, are unlawful. However, having regard to the fact that the impugned notification and the Act have been acted upon, the declaration of law will apply prospectively and will not affect any action taken by the Central Government or the RBI pursuant to the notification dated November 8, 2016. Hence, no relief is being granted in the individual petitions".
Justice Nagarathna however added that the measure was well-intentioned to target evils plaguing the nation's economy such as black money, terror funding and counterfeit currency.
"Before parting, I wish to observe that demonetisation was an initiative of the Central Government, targeted to address disparate evils, plaguing the Nation’s economy, including, practices of hoarding “black” money, counterfeiting, which in turn enable even greater evils, including terror funding, drug trafficking, emergence of a parallel economy, money laundering including Havala transactions. It is beyond the pale of doubt that the said measure, which was aimed at eliminating these depraved practices, was well-­intentioned. The measure is reflective of concern for the economic health and security of the country and demonstrates foresight. At no point has any suggestion been made that the measure was motivated by anything but the best intentions and noble objects for the betterment of the Nation. The measure has been regarded as unlawful only on a purely legalistic analysis of the relevant provisions of the Act and not on the objects of demonetisation", she said in conclusion.

The Allahabad High Court on Friday observed that the Learning Driving License and Voter I.D. Card should not be taken into account while determining the age of a juvenile. 
With this, the Bench of Justice Rahul Chaturvedi quashed the order of Special Judge, POCSO Act/Additional Sessions Judge, Bulandshahar rejecting an application moved on behalf of one Naushad Ali (Revisionist), booked under Rape, Penetrative Sexual Assault charges (under POCSO Act), for declaring him to be juvenile.
The case in brief
Essentially, Ali had moved to the HC by way of filing the instant revision plea against the order of the Special Judge, POCSO Act/Additional Sessions Judge, Bulandshahar. The Court below, relying upon his Voter ID, held that on the date of the incident, the revisionist was a major as his date of birth is April 7, 1994.
The counsel for the revisionist, Suresh Kumar Maurya, submitted that the High School Certificate of Ali made it clear that he had passed the High School Examination, 2015 from the Board of High School and Intermediate Education U.P., and in the certificate his date of birth mentioned as March 4, 2001. 
It was also argued that the Court below, while determining the age of the revisionist, had not taken into account the documents as enumerated in Section 94(2) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 and declined to declare him (revisionist), a juvenile.
Court's observations 
Having perused the impugned order, the Court observed that Special Judge, POCSO Act had grossly erred in law, while relying upon the Learning (Driving) License of the revisionist and Voter I.D. Card, as the Court, stressed that none of these documents should be taken into account while determining the age of a juvenile. 
The Court also noted that when in the High School Certificate, the age of the revisionist was mentioned, and which was available before the Special Judge, POCSO Act, he should have determined the age of the revisionist after taking into account the High School Certificate alone.
Consequently, holding that the Court wrongly rejected the claim of juvenility relying upon the documents which are not categorized in the Act of 2015, the Court quashed the impugned order and the matter was remanded back to the Court below with a direction to reconsider and re-visit the entire matter once again and decide the matter afresh.
The Court has also been directed to take into account the High School Certificate of the revisionist and decide the matter after authenticating and evaluating its genuineness, and pas a well-reasoned order on merits, strictly in accordance with law within a period of eight weeks.
With the aforesaid direction, the present revision stands disposed of.
Case title - Naushad Ali v. State Of U.P. Through Secretary Home And Another

The Bombay High Court has observed that a daughter-in-law cannot be directed to pay maintenance to her ailing mother-in-law, especially in the absence of any proof of the woman's income.
 "We have reservations about such direction to SS (daughter-in-law) to pay maintenance amount to the mother-in-law…Be that as it may, upon perusal of the original record, we do not find a single document showing the earnings of SS (daughter-in-law)," the HC observed. 
 It noted that Section 2(a) of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 that defines 'children,' includes son, daughter, grandson and grand-daughter, but does not refer to the daughter-in-law.
 Observing thus, the bench of Justices SS Shinde and Revati Mohite Dere set aside the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens' Tribunal's order to the limited extent. 
 The court upheld direction to the son and daughter -in- law to vacate the plush Juhu bungalow based on the mother's complaint. 
 However, the bench directed the son to foot the entire amount of Rs 25,000 awarded by the tribunal and payable to his mother, each month. And in doing so the HC relieved the daughter-in-law of any monetary liability.
 The court further directed the husband, a diamond merchant, to make arrangements for his wife's and children's stay outside the family home. "Son, being husband and guardian of two sons is legally obliged to provide them accommodation befitting his status, income and assets" the bench noted. 
 Facts of the case
 The senior citizen couple aged 77 and 79 had approached the tribunal, which asked the son and daughter-in-law to vacate their bungalow and jointly pay the mother maintenance of Rs 25,000 a month. The daughter in law approached the HC assailing this 2019 order. 
 The father- in -law passed away during adjudication of proceedings. 
 The daughter-in-law contended the residential premises was ancestral property that the father-in-law had inherited. Moreover, her husband was paying the rent for the premises. Represented by advocate Yasmin Tavaria, the daughter-in-law argued that in 2019 the Family court had passed an order restraining the husband or anyone through him from entering in the matrimonial home. 
 She also claimed that the Senior Citizen Tribunal's order was passed without leading evidence. 
 Advocate Vivek Kantawala for the mother-in-law submitted that there was continuous mental and physical harassment meted out to his client and therefore the tribunal's order deserved to be upheld. He said the daughter-in- law had tried to hurt their religious sentiments by throwing eggs, knowing fully well that the family practiced Jainism. 
 He further said that the Family Court order was passed in the absence of the mother in law since she was not part of the proceedings. 
 At the outset the court observed that Section 3 makes it clear that the Senior Citizens Act shall have overriding effect on the provisions of any other Act, which are inconsistent with the provisions of the said Act. In effect this would mean that the Tribunal's directions would stand despite the family court's order.
 The court upheld the tribunal's observations "family members viz., son and DIL should treat the mother-in-law with kindness, consideration and respect and that they should provide them basic necessities for a peaceful life. It is also observed that the kindness, consideration and respect cannot be bought with money."
The court further said that it was couple's responsibility to pay attention to the daily needs of the mother-in-law and to try their best to meet those needs.
"There is unrest and also there is a mental and physical harassment to the old aged parents."
 The bench noted how on several occasion the mother came to court on a wheelchair. 
 Based on section 3 and section 23 of the Act which provides for protection of life and property of senior citizens, the tribunal correctly concluded, that the senior citizen request for exclusion of the son's name from the suit property can be granted, the HC observed while granting relief.
Case Title : Sheetal Devang Shah versus Presiding Officer

The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Monday, while disposing of a habeas corpus petition filed by a mother alleging illegal detention of her 2 years old child at the hands of her husband and in-laws, held that a mother, even if she is mentally ill, is entitled to the custody of a minor child, especially if the child is below the age of 5 years, unless the mental illness is such that it shall be detrimental to the health of the child.
"In the case of a mother, especially where the custody concerns a child less than 5 years old, she ought to be granted custody unless she is so mentally or physically incapacitated that handing over custody to her would be physically or mentally detrimental to the health of the child."
 The petitioner-mother filed a petition praying for the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus directing the state-respondents to produce her minor child aged less than 2 years, from the 'illegal detention' of the private-respondents being her husband and her in-laws. 
 The facts which led to the petition were that the petitioner solemnized a marriage with respondent no. 4, out of which wedlock, their son was born. The petitioner alleged that on account of dowry demands, she was mistreated and faced a lot of harassment. On one particular occasion, the petitioner alleged that she was beaten by her husband and his family members. 
 She also alleged that her sister-in-law gave slaps on her face, after which she was thrown out of her matrimonial home, while retaining the child and depriving him of mother's feed. The petitioner submitted that despite her attempts to take her child along with her, the respondents remained adamant and retained the child, who she argued was retained as a bargaining chip. 
 The petitioner argued that a writ of habeas corpus was maintainable in this situation as habeas corpus can be issued at the instance of one parent against the other and that in child custody matters, the only relevant consideration was the welfare of the child. Since the welfare of the child was of paramount importance and in the present case as the child was about 2 years old and was on the mother's feed, his custody ought to be handed over to her, argued the petitioner.
 It was also contended by the petitioner that as per Section 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, where the minor child had not completed the age of 5 years, the custody should ordinarily be with the mother.
 The petitioner placed reliance on the decisions in Rajeswari Chandrasekar Ganesh v. State of Tamil Nadu and Others, Writ Petition (Criminal) No.402 of 2021, Tejaswini Gaud and Others v. Shekhar Jagdish Prasad Tewari and Others, 2019 (3) R.C.R. (Civil) 104 and on Rashneet Kaur v. State of Haryana and Others, CRWP-3251-2022.
 The private respondents, on the other hand, argued that the petitioner suffered from depression, was suicidal, had adjustment disorders and was aggressive, for which she was on medication. They also submitted that the petitioner was fond of late night parties and indulged in drinking alcohol, failed to take adequate care of the child, not giving him proper diet or mother's feed, due to which the child had to be often hospitalised. They further stated the petitioner to be self-abusive and submitted that she suffered from a mental condition even prior to her marriage. 
 The respondents, therefore, argued that looking at the mental condition of the mother, the welfare of the child lay in the hands of the private respondents. Moreover, they argued that the child had not been 'illegally detained' since the child was in the legal guardianship of his father. Reliance was placed by them on the decision in Poonam Kalsi v. State of Punjab and Others, 2022 (3) R.C.R. (Civil) 262 and Reetu Verma v. State of Haryana and Others, LPA No. 3716 of 2018.
 The single bench of Justice Jasjit Singh Bedi, ordered for the custody of the child to be handed over to the mother. 
 The Court first held that a writ of habeas corpus was maintainable by one parent against another and it was the duty of the Court to ascertain whether the custody of the child was unlawful or illegal and whether the welfare of the child required his present custody should be changed and be handed over to another. 
 "The question of the interest and welfare of a minor child has to be judged on the consideration of the acknowledged superiority of the mother's love and affection for the children. The lap of the mother is a natural cradle where the safety and welfare of the child can be assured and there is no substitute for the same. Maternal care and affection is therefore indispensable for the healthy growth of a child," said the Court. Reliance was placed on the decisions in Rajeswari Chandrasekar, Tejaswini Gaud, Rashneet Kaur, Poonam Kalsi and Reetu Verma.
 Since the respondents had also argued against the mental condition of the petitioner, the Court referred to Section 21(2) of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, which provides for the following:
 "A child under the age of three years of a woman receiving care, treatment or rehabilitation at a mental health establishment shall ordinarily not be separated from her during her stay in such establishment: Provided that where the treating Psychiatrist, based on his examination of the woman, and if appropriate, on information provided by others, is of the opinion that there is risk of harm to the child from the woman due to her mental illness or it is in the interest and safety of the child, the child shall be temporarily separated from the woman during her stay at the mental health establishment."
 Accordingly, the Court held: 
 "The entire case of the answering respondent nos. 4 to 6 is that the petitioner is mentally disturbed and therefore having abandoned the child was not entitled to his custody. However, assuming them to be genuine, in terms of the provisions of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, even if the petitioner was admitted in an institution for care and rehabilitation, even in such a situation, ordinarily a child under the age of 3 years ought not to be separated from her during her stay in such an institution. In the present case, firstly, the petitioner is not staying at any mental health establishment where she is receiving care or treatment. On the contrary, she is working with a multinational company. Therefore, there can be no justifiable reason to deny her the custody of the child who is barely 2 years and 3 months old. In fact, denial of custody to the petitioner who is the natural and biological mother of the child would be detrimental to the mental health of not only the child but the mother as well."

 Coram: Justice Jasjit Singh Bedi

Upholding the union government's Agnipath scheme for the armed forces, the Delhi High Court on Monday said it can conclusively state that the scheme was made in national interest to ensure that armed forces are better equipped. 
Referring to the skirmishes on the borders, the division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad said that such transgressions exacerbate the need to have a leaner and fitter Armed Force which is capable of handling the mental and physical distress that accompanies service in the Armed Forces. 
The court called the scheme a well thought out policy decision by the union government and said rather than focusing on the "alleged political motives" of the scheme, it is necessary to focus on the benefits that are being provided by it.
It also said that policy decisions, particularly those which have wide-ranging implications on the nation's health and security, should be decided by bodies best suited to do so. 
"It appears that the Government has been considering, for a long time, the possibility of creating an Armed Forces which consists of more youthful, agile, and physically adept individuals. Upon considering the opinions of experts bodies, defence personnel, and carefully studying the models adopted by other nations, it has decided to finally replace the prior mode of recruitment with the recruitment envisaged by the Agnipath Scheme. Considering that the stated objective of the Government is neither discriminatory nor mala fide, or arbitrary, this Court finds no reason to interfere with it." 
Policy Decision
The court said it is well settled that scope of judicial review does not extend to excessively questioning the policy decisions of the government, unless they are arbitrary, discriminatory or are based on irrelevant considerations.
Relying on the various precedents on the question of court's interference on policy decisions, the bench said it is exceedingly clear that the court does not interfere with policy decisions pertaining to national security in normal course, as it is not best placed to take such decisions. 
"Policy decisions with regard to national security are taken after careful consideration of the socio-political scenario of the country, along with the socio-political scenario of the border countries. Further, a measured analysis is undertaken when it comes to application of schemes propounded by other countries to the conditions in India. The Courts cannot and should not delve into the appropriateness of such policy decisions and, thus, endanger one of the most important aspects of the basic structure doctrine, i.e., the principle of separation of powers." 
The court said that while exercising its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, it cannot consider alternatives to the Impugned Scheme.
"The formulation of the Scheme is an exercise of the "sovereign policy-making functions" of the Central Government, which ought not to be interfered with unless on the settled principles discussed above," it added.
The court added that policy decisions, particularly those which have wide-ranging implications on the nation‟s health and security, should be decided by bodies best suited to do so. It appears that the Government has been considering, for a long time, the possibility of creating an Armed Forces which consists of more youthful, agile, and physically adept individuals, it added.
"Upon considering the opinions of experts bodies, defence personnel, and carefully studying the models adopted by other nations, it has decided to finally replace the prior mode of recruitment with the recruitment envisaged by the Agnipath Scheme. Considering that the stated objective of the Government is neither discriminatory nor mala fide, or arbitrary, this Court finds no reason to interfere with it," said the court.
Salient Features
However, the court went on to analyse the salient features of the scheme and said the Impugned Scheme, as stated, is a recruitment-generation scheme which will satisfy a large number of unemployed Indian youth and 25% of the Agniveers will be allowed to continue in the Armed Forces beyond the period of 4 years.
"This has been done by the Government in order to meet the objective of creating an Armed Force which is agile, youthful, physically fit, and mentally alert. This will bring the Indian Armed Forces in line with nations such as the inter alia United States, United Kingdom, and France. The importance of creating such a force has also been brought to the attention of this Court," it added.
The court further said Agniveer Scheme will increase the "leader to led" ratio from 1.1 to 1.28; a ratio that would inspire confidence, and would ease the pressure of the forces on ground.
"Expert opinions have also been sought on the Impugned Scheme; who have in fact suggested the revamping of the existing in-take and retention scheme as well. Considering the fact that the laudable objective of maintaining national security is at the heart of the Impugned Scheme, this Court does not find it arbitrary, capricious or devoid of reason."
The court also noted that a number of Agniveers will be absorbed by the Public Sector Undertakings and other government establishments on various posts. They would also be given various certificates which would enable them to secure a job in the government and PSUs, said the court.
"Working with the Army for four years will definitely instil a feeling of nationalism in the Agniveers which is important for the youth of the country. This feeling of nationalism will be a major deterrent for these persons from resorting to crime in the future," said the court.
The court further observed that four years training period would also instil a sense of nationalism in these personnel that would more or less prompt them to use their skills and focus on the development of the country.
"Such advantages cannot be overlooked and dislodged on the basis of the apprehension that after four years such individuals may be unemployed or the mere apprehension that they may take to illegal or unethical activities, after being trained in the Army. This Impugned Scheme cannot be interfered with by this Court only on the basis of such apprehensions and bald averments," it added.
On the argument that Agniveers would not be given pension at the end of four years, the court said:
"Such pension, it has been contended, is being extended to soldiers from other nations which have deployed similar short term services in the Armed Forces. However, the Petitioners have failed to realise that a principal distinction between nations such as Israel, which have deployed such a policy, and India, is that the Indian Government has not made it mandatory for the youth of the nation to serve in the Armed forces." 
The court rejected the argument that the Government has failed to make provisions for the meaningful employment of Agniveers in the future. 
"As stated earlier, the Government has in fact sought to extend entrepreneurship financial schemes such as MUDRA and Start-Up India to Agniveers as well. Furthermore, the Government has avowed to give Agniveers priority in government organisations; 10% reservation has been made for Agniveers in the Department of CAPF under the Ministry of Home Affairs, 10% in all the Departments under the Ministry of Defence, and 5% in all the Departments under the Railways. Material on record also discloses that the Impugned Scheme will not only provide opportunity for youth to serve the country but will also result in the Armed Forces having the most capable individuals who will be rewarded with a decent financial package and a bright future."

The Supreme Court observed that evidence given by a witness can not be discarded as a whole on the ground that it is exaggerated."To make a mountain out of a molehill, the molehill shall have to exist primarily. A Court of law, being mindful of such distinction is duty bound to disseminate 'truth' from 'falsehood' and sift the grain from the chaff in case of exaggerations", the bench...
The Supreme Court observed that evidence given by a witness can not be discarded as a whole on the ground that it is exaggerated.
"To make a mountain out of a molehill, the molehill shall have to exist primarily. A Court of law, being mindful of such distinction is duty bound to disseminate 'truth' from 'falsehood' and sift the grain from the chaff in case of exaggerations", the bench comprising CJI NV Ramana, Justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose observed.
In this case, the appellant-convicts contended that the statements made by the prosecution witnesses contained exaggerations and therefore it was wrong to convict him on the basis of such statements. According to the FIR,  the deceased died owing to a single axe blow inflicted by the accused and the post­mortem report also showed only one head injury on her person. However, three prosecution eyewitnesses, deposed that the first accused gave two axe blows on her head and then co ­accused  also hit the deceased's left ear with an axe twice.
In appeal, the Court agreed with the State's contention that even in cases where a major portion of the evidence is found deficient, if the residue is sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused, conviction can be based on it. The bench observed:
24. It is vehemently contended that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses is exaggerated and thus false. Cambridge Dictionary defines "exaggeration" as "the fact of making something larger, more important, better or worse than it really is". Merriam­ Webster defines the term "exaggerate" as to "enlarge beyond bounds or the truth". The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines it as "enlarged or altered beyond normal proportions". These expressions unambiguously suggest that the genesis of an 'exaggerated statement' lies in a true fact, to which fictitious additions are made so as to make it more penetrative. Every exaggeration, therefore, has the ingredients of 'truth'. No exaggerated statement is possible without an element of truth. On the other hand, Page | 18 Advance Law Lexicon defines "false" as "erroneous, untrue; opposite of correct, or true". Oxford Concise Dictionary states that "false" is "wrong; not correct or true". Similar is the explanation in other dictionaries as well. There is, thus, a marked differentia between an 'exaggerated version' and a 'false version'. An exaggerated statement contains both truth and falsity, whereas a false statement has no grain of truth in it (being the 'opposite' of 'true'). It is well said that to make a mountain out of a molehill, the molehill shall have to exist primarily. A Court of law, being mindful of such distinction is duty bound to disseminate 'truth' from 'falsehood' and sift the grain from the chaff in case of exaggerations. It is only in a case where the grain and the chaff are so inextricably intertwined that in their separation no real evidence survives, that the whole evidence can be discarded
Taking note of the statements made by the prosecution witnesses, the bench observed that even if the exaggeration of multiple axe blows being given to the deceased were discarded, the allegation that the accused entered house of the victims armed with an axe and hit the deceased on her head, and that she died due to a head injury was consistent and undisputed throughout the FIR and the deposition by prosecution witnesses.
Referring to Hari Chand v. State of Delhi (1996) 9 SCC 112, the court said that while appreciating the evidence of witnesses in a criminal trial especially in a case of eyewitnesses the maxim falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus cannot apply and the court has to make efforts to sift the grain from the chaff.
The court also addressed the contention of the accused (against reversal of acquittal by the High court) that if two views are possible, the High Court ought not to interfere with the trial Court's judgment.  
"15.. However, such a precautionary principle cannot be overstretched to portray that the "contours of appeal" against acquittal under Section 378 CrPC are limited to seeing whether or not the trial Court's view was impossible. It is equally well settled that there is no bar on the High Court's power to re­appreciate evidence in an appeal against acquittal... the CrPC does not differentiate in the power, scope, jurisdiction or limitation between appeals against judgments of conviction or acquittal and that the appellate Court is free to consider on both fact and law, despite the self-restraint that has been ingrained into practice while dealing with orders of acquittal where there is a double presumption of innocence of the accused.", the bench observed while upholding the conviction.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has observed that once it is shown that deceased/injured persons were traveling as unauthorised passengers in an offending vehicle and their risk is not covered under the terms insurance policy, the insurer cannot be saddled with the liability to compensate them and even the principle of 'Pay and Recover' will not be attracted.
Justice Sanjay Dhar made these observations in an appeal filed by an Insurance Company against an award passed by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Doda granting compensation in favour of the claims made by or on behalf of unauthorised passengers traveling in a load carrier truck, allegedly driven in a rash and negligent manner.
Counsel for the Insurance Company Adv. Dinesh Singh Chouhan premised his appeal on the ground that the deceased/injured in the case were travelling as gratuitous passengers and as such, risk to the life was not covered under the policy of insurance.
The claimants contended that they were forced to board the truck after being stranded in the middle of the road by some Army personnel, who needed the bus in which the claimants were travelling for their own purpose.
The moot question that fell for adjudication was as to whether the appellant-Insurance Company could be saddled with the liability to satisfy an award on account of death or bodily injuries of an unauthorised passenger or in the alternative whether order of “pay and recover” could be made against the insurer in such a case. 
Dealing with the matter Justice Dhar noted though the offending vehicle was insured, the risk to the lives of passengers in the offending vehicle, which is a load carrier, was not covered in the policy. The bench said,
"If at all the deceased/injured were forcibly made to board the offending vehicle, they may have the grievance against the Army personnel but they cannot have a cause of action against the appellant-Insurance Company, as it had nothing to do with the alleged forcible boarding of the deceased/injured in the truck in question", the court said.
Commenting on the Pay and Recover principle with respect to an unauthorised passenger, Justice Dhar explained that once it is shown that deceased/injured were travelling as unauthorised passengers in the offending truck, their risk was not covered under the terms of policy of insurance. Thus, the direction for pay and recover can also not be passed against the appellant-Insurance Company in these cases, it maintained.
In view of the said legal position the bench allowed the appeal and the appellant-Insurance Company was exonerated from its liability to satisfy the awards impugned.

Observing that Courts cannot issue a writ of mandamus for enforcing the directive principles of State policy, the Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently closed a petition seeking closure of liquor shops and establishments in the UT, besides seeking rehabilitation of those engaged in this business. The bench comprising Justices Sanjeev Kumar and Puneet Gupta was hearing a plea seeking recall of the order passed by the division bench of the court on October, 27, 2015, in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) which was filed by Karwani Islami Society, registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1998, seeking direction to the erstwhile State of J&K, to take necessary steps for prohibition of sale and consumption of liquor in the erstwhile State of J&K. Earlier in 2015, the division bench while disposing of the PIL had held that it was not permissible under law to issue writ of mandamus to enforce strict prohibition in the then State of J&K. The bench had then further observed that the Article 47 of the Constitution of India, which was strongly relied upon by the petitioner in the PIL was held not enforceable through the Court of law, as being enshrined as a directive principles of the State policy. Dealing with the matter in hand the bench said that the trade in liquor in the UT of J&K is regulated by the J&K Excise Act and the rules framed therein and hence the government is empowered to frame Excise policy to regulate such trade within four corners of Excise Act and rules framed therein. Highlighting the fact that several excise policies have been issued after 2015, the bench said that as a matter of fact, respondents are coming up with new Excise policy every year. "That being the position, this petition, by the efflux of time is rendered infructuous. The petitioner, however, if feels aggrieved by the Excise policy in vogue or Excise policy, which is issued for the next financial year, shall be well within its right to make his grievance by setting up specific case against any of the terms and conditions of the policy," the court said. The court further noted that while disposing of the PIL in 2015, the court had also given liberty to the petitioner or any person, who is affected or interested in the implementation of the restriction/regulations, to approach the Court for appropriate direction and it seems that taking cue from aforesaid direction, the petitioner has filed this petition. "Be that as it may, we reiterate that this Court cannot, by issuing writ of mandamus, enforce the directive principles of State policy and direct the respondents to enforce strict prohibition in the Union Territory of J&K," the bench said. Observing that the instant petition, which has otherwise outlived its purpose and is rendered infructuous, the court said that in view of the same , no directions as prayed for in the petition are called for and accordingly closed the plea.

The Karnataka High Court has said that if some landowners have relinquished their land it cannot be a ground to compel other landowners to do so except in accordance with law.
 A single judge bench of Justice Krishna S Dixit, partly allowed a bunch of petitions and restrained the Land Acquisition officer of Sagar City Municipal Council, from forcibly taking away the land of petitioners for expansion of a road.
 The court rejected the submission of the government counsel that some of the land owners have agreed and accordingly given up their lands by executing Relinquishment Deeds and therefore, this course is open to the Petitioners as well wherein the compensation payable would be three times the Guideline value keeping in view the provisions of Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.
 It said “That cannot be a legal ground to compel the petitioners to give up their land too. Since constitutionally guaranteed avails to the property of individuals and not necessarily the collection of individuals. An argument to the contrary would undermine the sanctity & efficacy of Article 300A and therefore, cannot be countenanced.”
 The petitioner’s counsel had submitted that the Right to Property though not a Fundamental Right is constitutionally guaranteed under Article 300A. His clients cannot be compelled to give up their property except in accordance with law. Moreover, his clients are not agreeable for relinquishing their property and therefore, if at all the State wants these properties, the acquisition process under 2013 Act is the only course open.
 Further, it was prayed that his clients’ ownership & possession should be protected from interference of the Respondents save with the authority of law.
 The bench agreed with the submissions made by the petitioners and said “Lands cannot be touched by the State and the authorities, save by acquisition in accordance with law the Right to Property having been constitutionally guaranteed.”
 Thus it directed “The Respondents are restrained from interfering with the properties of the Petitioners till after the same are acquired in accordance with law, namely 2013 Act.”

The Kerala High Court has ruled that a Magistrate is empowered to decide the pela of talaq raised by the husband in his wife's petition filed under the Domestic Violence Act if he disputes their marital status on that ground. 
Justice Kauser Edappagath thereby allowed a criminal revision petition holding that the finding of the appellate court that the Magistrate has no power to decide the validity of the talaq is wrong and only to be set aside.
"In a petition filed by the wife under the DV Act, if the husband disputes the marital status on the ground that he has divorced the wife by the pronouncement of talaq, the Magistrate has every power to decide whether the said plea is valid or not. "
The petitioners- wife and minor daughter- approached the Judicial Magistrate seeking protection, residential and monetary orders u/s 12(1) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. It is the case of the petitioners that using all the gold and money given by her parents, the first respondent (her husband) constructed a house on his property in which they all resided. Therefore, according to the petitioners, this house is their shared household.
In December 2009, her husband and his brothers allegedly assaulted her on two occasions and she was stabbed with a knife in her head. It was after this that she approached the Magistrate with her daughter. 
However, the husband argued that he had pronounced triple talaq in December 2009 and that they were divorced since then. He denied all allegations of receiving gold from her parents and domestic violence. He contended that he constructed the house with his own funds and that it is not a shared household. 
Finding that the husband failed to prove the pronouncement of talaq, the Magistrate allowed the plea in part, granting the petitioner protection and residential orders, but not the relief of return of gold and money. 
This order was challenged by the husband in appeal, and the appeal was allowed on the ground that the Magistrate under the exercise of the power under the provisions of the DV Act cannot decide the validity of talaq. It was further held that prima facie there was material to show that the husband had pronounced talaq, therefore, the status of the petitioner is that of a divorced woman and she is not entitled to claim maintenance.
Aggrieved by this, the petitioner moved the High Court with a revision petition. 
The Court observed that the talaq allegedly pronounced by the husband was not valid in the eyes of law since he pronounced triple talaq at a go without following any of the procedures mentioned in the decisions of the Supreme Court. 
Therefore, the Magistrate could not have been held to be incompetent to decide the validity of the talaq, although the plea was filed under the Domestic Violence Act. 
Similarly, there was sufficient evidence to prove that the petitioner was subjected to domestic violence and yet the appellate court proceeded to set aside the order of the Magistrate on flimsy grounds. This finding of the appellant court was found to be perverse and not sustainable. 
It was also found that none of the definitions in the DV Act contemplates that on the date of filing an application, the party should be actually residing or living together. The very phrase, 'has lived together at any point of time' necessarily covers even the past cohabitation or past living together. 
The Court further held that even the continued residence or occupation of the shared household is not required for the entitlement of a wife to get a residential order. 
Therefore, it was held that the petitioners had satisfactorily proved that they were entitled to protection, residence, monetary and compensation orders which were rightly granted by the trial court. Since the appellate court had committed gross illegality in reversing the order of the trial court and dismissing the petition, the Judge found it to be a fit case where the discretionary power vested with this court u/s 397 r/w 401 of CrPC could be exercised.
As such, the revision petition was allowed and the judgment of the appellate court was set aside. 
Advocates P. Haridas, Renji George Cherian and P.C. Shijin appeared for the petitioners while Advocates B. Mohanlal and Public Prosecutor Sangeetha Raj appeared for the respondents.

The Karnataka High Court recently observed that if a wife moves out of the matrimonial house due to ill-treatment meted out by husband, he cannot claim that she moved out by mutual consent and thus he is not liable to pay maintenance amount.
 A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna made the observation while dismissing a petition filed by one Satish N questioning the proceedings registered by the respondent-wife seeking maintenance from him.
 The petitioner and the respondent got married in November 2016. The respondent- wife registered a complaint against him in December 2020, alleging offences punishable under Sections 498A, 504 read with 34 of IPC and later on, preferred an application seeking maintenance under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C.
 It was contended that the petition was not even maintainable and the Family Court has declined to consider these submissions, stating that the same would be taken note of after hearing the respondent wife and while considering the matter for grant of maintenance or otherwise. Reliance was placed upon Section 125(4) Cr.P.C which states that no wife shall be entitled to receive an allowance from her husband under this section if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent..
 The petitioner-husband argued that the respondent on her own consent or with the consent of the husband moved out of the matrimonial house and therefore, the husband -petitioner is not liable to pay any maintenance.
 The court relied on the averments made by the wife in her petition seeking maintenance and said,
"The respondent-wife narrates about unbearable harassment and ill-treatment from both by the husband and mother- in- law has resulted in her going away from matrimonial house. This can by no stretch mean moving away of the wife by mutual consent, for the petitioner to contend that proceedings were not maintainable."
 Following which the court said there were no grounds to interfere at this juncture, the petition stands dismissed.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court, Indore Bench recently directed the Union of India to release the amount of compensation awarded to Petitioners, senior citizens, for their Bungalow that was resumed by the Ministry of Defence for their own purposes. 
The Court observed that the Union of India was dragging its feet in paying the amount to the Petitioners despite its specific directions to the executing court to dispose of the execution proceeding within 4 months.
 Justice Subodh Abhyankar was dealing with a writ petition filed by the Petitioners seeking directions of the Court to the Central Government to comply with the award passed by the Competent Arbitration Committee for resuming their property by the Ministry of Defence for their own purposes, and compensate them accordingly.
 The case of the Petitioners was that they were awarded compensation by the Arbitration Committee for their bungalow that was resumed by the Ministry of Defence but the same was not being executed despite the award being granted 10 years back. They asserted that despite their age, they were running pillar to post to get their compensation but to no anvil. The Petitioners further submitted that they had earlier filed a writ petition before the Court wherein the Court had directed the executing court to decide the pending execution case of the arbitration award within 4 months but the same was not complied with.
 The Centre submitted that the award passed by the Arbitration Committee was not in terms of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and that the award was in the form of recommendation to the Ministry of Defence, which was rejected vide order passed by the authority concerned, 10 years later. They further argued that since the award was recommendatory in nature, the same could not be executed by the trial court.
 Considering the submissions of parties and documents on record, the Court opined that although the award used the term Anushansa i.e. recommendation, nothing was brought on record by the UoI that would state that the said award/recommendation was not binding in nature.
 The Court took strong exception to the order passed by the Ministry of Defence, whereby it rejected the award given by the Arbitration Committee after 10 years of its passing-
 On perusal of the aforesaid order it is apparent that on earlier occasion also the award passed by the Arbitration Committee has been directed to be complied with by this court. In such facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is of the considered opinion that merely if the award dated 30/11/2011 has been rejected or set aside by the respondents, on 08/03/2022 i.e., after 10 years, and taking note of the order dated 02/03/2020 passed by this Court in WP No.4117/2020, this Court has no hesitation to come to a conclusion that the respondents have not only failed in their duties to redress the grievance of senior citizens 74 years and 66 years old respectively, but have also failed to perform their duties with due diligence.
 The Court further observed that the Centre neither challenged the award or the proceedings before the executing court and that it was avoiding the implementation of award despite clear directions of the Court-
 It is also found the award dated 30/11/2011, passed by the Arbitration Committee has not been challenged by them in any court of law and even the execution proceedings have never been challenged on the ground that there is no award under the Arbitration Act and it was only a recommendation. What this court sees is only Tareekh pe Tareekh sought by the UOI to satisfy the award, especially when the case is pending since 01/04/2009 and it was specifically directed by this court vide order dated 02.03.2020 in W.P.No.4117/2020, to dispose of the proceedings within 4 months' time…
 The Court noted that even the executing court did not conclude the proceedings within 4 months, even after two years from the date of the Court's order directing it to do so, which was demonstrative of its failure 'to exercise the powers vested in it by law despite being armed with the aforesaid order' of the Court, which also had the effect of demeaning its own authority.
 With regard to the order passed by the Ministry of Defence, the Court held that the same was only an eye wash which was passed to get out of the unpleasant situation of paying the compensation to the Petitioner-
 So far as the order dated 08/03/2022 passed by the respondents rejecting the award passed by the Arbitration Committee on 30/11/2011 is concerned, in the considered opinion of this court it is only an eye wash and appears to have been passed only with a view to wriggle out of this unpleasant situation and is of no help to the respondent at this juncture of the lis. It is also beyond the faculties of this court as to why, after acquiring the property of a citizen in the year 2009, a democratic Government would shy away from making the payment and would not part with a single penny even in the year 2022.
 With the aforesaid observations, the Court directed the Central Government to release the amount of compensation awarded to the Petitioners in terms of the award within a period of 6 months. Accordingly, the petition was allowed.

"Mere contacts with the co-accused who were found in possession cannot be treated to be a corroborative material in absence of substantive material found against the accused," the Gujarat High Court has affirmed today.

"Mere contacts with the co-accused who were found in possession cannot be treated to be a corroborative material in absence of substantive material found against the accused," the Gujarat High Court has affirmed today. The Bench comprising Justice Umesh A. Trivedi was hearing an application under Section 439 for offences under Sections 8(c), 22(c), and 29 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985.
 Background
 The Applicant primarily contended that barring the call records of the Applicant which showed that he had called around the time of offence, there was no evidence of the Applicant's interaction with the co-accused. Further, the material whatsapp chats were deleted from the devices of co-accused and were unavailable at the given time. Significantly, methamphetamine was recovered from the co-accused but nothing was retrieved from the possession of the Applicant or his premises at the time of arrest. The Applicant pointed to Section 29 of the Act of 1985 to contend that there was no conspiracy amongst the co-accused. Another accused had also been released and so on the ground of parity, the Applicant must be released. The Applicant relied on Bharat Chaudhary vs Union of India [2021 SCC OnLine SC 1235] to submit that the absence of any possession of contraband article and the print outs of whatsapp messages downloaded from the mobile phone were not sufficient material to establish live link between the co-accused and the Applicant. 
 Per contra, the Respondent-Authority submitted that the Applicant was in live contact with the co-accused from whom contraband was found. Additionally, the Applicant had ordered the contraband for delivery from the two accused. A further averment was that per Section 35 of the Act, there was a presumption of culpable mental state of the accused may be inferred from the whatsapp chat between the accused as well as call data records.
 Judgement
 Justice Trivedi's foremost observation was that the Applicant was not found in possession of any contraband article. The Court while dismissing the value of mere contacts with the co-accused as corroborative evidence, averred:
 "However, screenshot of one of the whatsapp chat in between the co-accused shown to the Court, there is hardly anything which connects the applicant with the present offence or even asserting that he ordered for the same which were to be delivered by the accused found in possession of contraband."
 Justice Trivedi noted that there was no criminal antecedent of the Applicant and no apprehension by the Prosecution that he would likely commit any offence on bail. Considering the Bharat Chadhuary precedent and the foregoing circumstances, the High Court granted bail to the Applicant on a personal bond of INR 15,000 with one surety. The following conditions were provided:
 Not take undue advantage of liberty or misuse libertyNot act in a manner injurious to the interest of the prosecutionSurrender passport Not leave the India without prior permission of Sessions JudgeMark presence before concerned police station once between 1st and 5th day for six monthsFurnish latest and permanent address of residence and contact details
 Accordingly, the Bail Applicant was allowed.

While dealing with a petition seeking conversion of some Police Officers from Armed Reserve to Law and Order, the Madras High Court observed that suitability and eligibility, etc had to be assessed by the concerned departments and High Courts could not interfere in such matters. Interference was only possible when there was an irregularity in appointments.
 Justice SM Subramaniam observed as under,
 Thus, the assessment of suitability and eligibility are the prerogative of the Competent Authorities, which cannot be interfered with by the High Court, while exercising the powers of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Such an interference may be required, if the power is exercised in an unfair manner or the assessment is tainted with mala fides or Favouritism and Nepotism.
 The petitioners who were recruited as Sub-Inspectors of Police had approached the court contenting that they were entitled for conversion from Armed Reserve to Law and Order category as per Government Policy. They submitted that the cases of similarly placed officers was positively considered by the respondents but that of the petitioners was not considered on the ground that they had crossed 40 years of age and suffered certain punishments in departmental disciplinary proceedings. 
 Drawing attention to the Government Order, the respondents objected to the prayer and submitted that the Government Order contains certain terms and conditions for such conversion. If these terms and conditions were not complied with, the cases would not be considered for conversion. As per these conditions, the person must be a graduate, should not have completed the age of 40 years, should have put in five years of service as Sub-Inspector, and should have an unblemished record of service, eligibility, selection, training, internal assessment, etc. The respondent thus submitted that the petitioners had completed 40 years of age and had suffered punishments under departmental disciplinary proceedings. 
 Though the petitioners contended that in a similar instance, the division bench of the court had granted conversion to officers facing criminal charges, the respondents submitted that the facts and circumstances, in that case, were different. In the case referred by the petitioners, disciplinary proceedings were deferred and there was no suspension. 
 After hearing both the sides, the court opined that while allowing conversion, the competent authorities had to follow the eligibility criteria to ensure that only able persons are posted to the Law and Order category.
 While undertaking the process of conversion, the Competent Authorities are bound to follow the eligibility criteria, so as to ensure that women and men of ability are posted in Law and Order category. The assessment of suitability and eligibility must be made in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Government in this regard and such an assessment made in accordance with the guidelines by the Competent Authority cannot be interfered with by the High Court in a routine manner.
 The court emphasized that the authorities were the best persons to assess the eligibility of the personnel. Since the personnel posted in the Law and order category had more responsibility and accountability, the government thought it fit to prescribe certain additional criterias. Further, conversion could not be claimed as a matter of right. Even if the conversion was granted to certain personnel violating the guidelines, illegality could not be a ground to claim equality.
"There are large scale allegations from the public against the Police Personnel working in the Law and Order category.... High Discipline, Honesty and Integrity are the need of the hour...The Fundamental Rights ensured under Part III of the Constitution is to be protected by the Law and Order wing of the Police Department as they are the law enforcing authority in the society...If the Police personnel with lack of integrity is posted in Law and Order wing, then it will have a direct implication on the maintenance of Law and Order in the society."
It also cautioned that any "misplaced sympathy" towards any police personnel in the matter of conversion by any higher authority is directly in violation of the Constitutional provisions.
 Finally, finding that the reliefs could not be granted in the present case, the writ petitions were dismissed.
While parting, the bench called for effective measures for "prevention" of crimes. It observed,
"The Police Department has to thrive hard to ensure prevention of crimes in the society. This is the right time to work out modalities for effective prevention of crimes in the society. No doubt, investigation skills are also an important factor, but if prevention is effectively made, then commission of crime and investigation would be minimized."

The Gujarat High Court recently quashed an order of the passport authorities impounding the passport of one, Gulamhusen Dadamiya Pir on the ground that he was engaged in some anti-national activities.
It is interesting to note that the passport of the petitioner was not impounded by invoking the provisions of Section 10(3)(c) of the Passports Act, 1967, which refers to the impounding of a passport, if the holder of such passport is involved in any activities, which is against the interest of the sovereignty, integrity and the security of India.
Rather, the petitioner's passport was impounded under Section 10(3)(h) of the Passports Act, 1967, which refers to the impounding of the passport on the ground of registration of a criminal offence against the passport holder.
The bench of Justice A. S. Supehia observed that neither any material suggesting the involvement of the petitioner in any anti-national activities had been produced before the High Court nor any material indicating that any criminal offence had been registered against the petitioner had been produced by the respondents.
"The impugned order dated 03.09.2020 refers to the provisions of Section 10 (3) (h) of the Passports Act, 1967. Since no material has been produced by the respondent authorities that the petitioner has been involved in any criminal offence despite a specific statement made by him in the writ-petition in this regard, the invocation of the aforesaid provision by the impugned order dated 03.09.2020 is misconceived and misdirected. Hence, the impugned orders require to be quashed and set aside," the Court held.
The case involved the impounding of the passport of petitioner Gulamhusen. He was asked to surrender the passport in Feb 2017, which he did. Thereafter, he moved to the HC for directions to authorities seeking the return of his passport, and he was asked to make a fresh application for the return of his passport before the concerned authorities and the respondent authorities were directed to decide the same in accordance with law. 
When he made an application, the passport authorities asked him to give an undertaking that he would provide information about criminal cases, if filed against him. He gave an undertaking that no criminal case had been registered against him, despite this fact, his passport was not released.
Subsequently, in September 2020, the passport office wrote to Gulamhusen informing him that his passport was impounded on grounds that he was involved in anti-national activities. Challenging the same, Gulamhusen moved the court again and when the High court sough evidence in that regard, the respondent authorities could not provide any details about his involvement in any anti-national activity.
In view of this, the Court quashed and set aside the order of the passport authorities. The respondents were directed to release the passport of the petitioner within a period of one month.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court, Indore Bench recently refused to pass an order of child custody in favour of the Appellant-mother, upon noting that the children themselves had expressed their inclination to reside with their father.
"It is true that both of them are minor, however, the age of 16 years is not such an age where a child, given a choice, is not able to make up his or her mind as to his or her inclination to reside with either of the parents. In the present case, this choice has been exercised in favour of the father and thus, despite agreeing with the contentions of the appellant/petitioner regarding the legality of the impugned order, the learned Writ Court has not found it to be appropriate to hand over the custody of the children to the appellant/petitioner/wife," division bench of Justice Subodh Abhyankar and Justice Satyendra Kumar Singh observed.
The Bench was essentially dealing with a writ appeal preferred by the Appellant against the order of the Writ Court, whereby it quashed the order of Sub-Divisional Magistrate granting custody of children to the father (respondent no. 4), however, did not explicitly grant custody of the children to her.
 The Court noted that ordinarily, when an impugned order is set aside by a higher authority, the status quo, prior to the date of impugned order is restored. However, the present case was not in respect of the any immovable or movable property or any live stock. It pertained to the lives of two human beings, who had expressed their inclinations.
"It is nobody's case that the respondent No.4 (father) is in any manner incompetent or is having such vices which may prejudice the interest of the children in his company. In the considered opinion of this court, had it been a case where the father was not found fit to provide healthy environment to the children's upbringing, this court would certainly have interfered in the impugned order and the choice made by the children, but there are no such facts brought on record by the appellant," the Court ordered.
Facts of the case were that the Appellant had twin sons with her husband, who were around 16 years old. Following a matrimonial dispute, the husband filed before an application SDM concerned, under Section 97 of CrPC, seeking custody of children. The SDM allowed the application and the custody of the children was handed over to the respondent no. 4.
 The aforesaid order was challenged by the Appellant/wife before the High Court, whereby the single bench partly allowed the appeal and quashed the order of SDM. It further directed the husband to not force the children to live with him, and that the children were free to live with their mother.
 The Appellant argued that despite the petition being allowed by the Writ Court and the impugned order being quashed, she got no relief as the custody of her sons were not given to her explicitly. She prayed for the order to be modified, accordingly to the extent that the custody of the children be handed over to her from the husband.
 Per contra, the husband submitted that no interference was called for as the single bench of the Court had passed the order after having an interaction with the children, who had expressed their willingness to reside with their father only. Thus, he argued that the appeal was liable to be dismissed.
 Considering the contentions of the parties and the material on record, the Court noted that since the children themselves chose to live with their father, thus, the Writ Court rightly did not find it to be appropriate to hand over the custody of the children to her.
 With the aforesaid observations, the Court refused to interfere with the order of the Writ Court and the appeal was accordingly dismissed.

"It is settled law that, in order to bring a case within provisions of Section 306 of the IPC, there must be a case of suicide and in commission of the offence, person who is said to have abetted the alleged suicide, must have played an active role by an act of instigating or by doing a certain act to facilitate commission of suicide", the Gujarat High Court has held.

"It is settled law that, in order to bring a case within provisions of Section 306 of the IPC, there must be a case of suicide and in commission of the offence, person who is said to have abetted the alleged suicide, must have played an active role by an act of instigating or by doing a certain act to facilitate commission of suicide", the Gujarat High Court has held. 
The Bench of Justice Ilesh Vora was hearing an application under Section 438 of CrPC praying for anticipatory bail in connection with an FIR for offences under Sections 306, 498-A and 114 of IPC and Sections 3 and 7 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.
 The Applicants herein were the father-in-law and the mother-in-law of the deceased. They were accused of harassing the deceased by demanding dowry and subjecting her to cruelty in petty domestic issues. She had also informed her parents about the cruelty and harassment and in this background, the deceased committed suicide at her matrimonial home by hanging herself.
 The Applicants contested that the facts of the case did not constitute the offence under Section 306 of IPC since there was no specific allegation that the Applicants had instigated or abetted the deceased to commit suicide. Further, the husband, the Accused No.1 was already behind bars while the parents had played no role in the commission of cruelty.
 Per contra, the Respondents submitted that the Applicants had demanded dowry and INR 4 lacs was deposited at the time of marriage along with gold ornaments and other gifts. However, demand for dowry was consistent in the duration of marriage. Accordingly, the offence of abetment as under Section 107 of the IPC was committed and consequently Section 306 could be applied.
 Justice Vora, while taking note of the facts and circumstances, observed that first 4 lacs were deposited in the account of Accused No.1. However, even he had paid INR 3 lacs as dowry and gifts towards the marriage. The Respondents had, meanwhile, produced medical prescriptions to establish that the deceased was undergoing stress, anxiety and depression. 
The Bench opined that there were no specific instances that are essential for applying Section 306 of the IPC. For section 306, there must be commission of suicide, and in commission, the person who is alleged to have abetted the suicide must have played an active role by an act of instigation or doing a certain act to facilitate the suicide. 
 Per the Bench, this was a fit case for granting pre-arrest bail. Accordingly, anticipatory bail was issued with a personal bond of INR 10,000 without prejudice to the right of the Accused to seek stay against an order of remand.

The Kerala High Court on Friday quashed the two FIRs registered by the Kerala Police Crime Branch against "unnamed officials" of the Enforcement Directorate for allegedly coercing the accused in the gold smuggling case to give false incriminating statements implicate Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and other state functionaries.
In a judgment pronounced on Friday, the High Court held that the bar under Section 195(1)(b) of the CrPC was attracted in the case against the FIRs. As per Section 195(1)(b) CrPC, the cognizance of an offecne relating to fabrication of evidence in a matter pending before court can be taken only on the basis of a complaint filed by that Court.
The High Court held that the police could not have registered the FIRs for Section 193 IPC(offence relating to false evidence), in view of the bar under Section 195(1)(b) CrPC. The Court also observed that the other offences mentioned in the FIR are "undoubtedly interwoven and inseperable" with Section 193 IPC.
"...the offence under Section 193 IPC being a non-cognisable offence, the Crime Branch could not have registered the crimes without following the procedure under Section 155(1) Cr.P.C, despite the deeming clause under Section155(4). Hence, the remedy of the aggrieved persons was to approach the Special Court", the order passed by a bench of Justice VG Arun said.
The Court held that the proper remedy would have been for the police to approach the Special PMLA Court, which has taken cognizance of the ED's final report, with the complaint that the ED officials were fabricating evidence.
As regards the FIR registered with respect to the alleged coercion of smuggling accused Sandeep Nair, the High Court noted that his statement under Section 161 CrPC has been recorded. Taking note of this fact, the Court said that the Special Court will be at liberty to look into the materials collected by the Crime Branch following the procedure under Section 340 CrPC.
""As far as the instant cases are concerned, the Special Court has already received the complaint of the accused Sandeep Nair and has allowed the application of the Crime Branch to question him in jail. The 161 Statement of Sandeep Nair recorded thereafter was made available to me in a sealed cover. In my considered opinion, while interdicting the police from continuing the investigation, the interest of justice requires the Special Judge be permitted to look into the materials collected by the Crime Branch treating it as a petition under Section 340(1) CrPC so as to decide whether it is expedient to conduct an inquiry", the bench noted in the order.
The Court directed that the materials collected by the investigating officers be produced before the Special Court in a sealed cover.
"The Investigating Officers shall forthwith submit all records pertaining to the crimes before the Special Court in a sealed cover. The learned Special Judge can look into those records and other materials, if any available, while deciding whether it is expedient to conduct an enquiry".
A Bench of Justice VG Arun pronounced judgment in two writ petitions moved by Deputy Director of ED Kochi Zone, P Radhakrishnan, challenging two First Information Reports (FIRs) registered by Kerala Police Crime Branch.
The Court had earlier directed that no coercive action be taken against officials of the ED and had recorded an undertaking made by Senior Public Prosecutor that official witnesses would not be called till the matter was decided.
 The FIRs allege that gold smuggling accused were coerced during ED's investigation of the gold smuggling case to implicate certain high-ranking members of the State Government including the Chief Minister. The first FIR is based on an alleged audio clip by gold smuggling accused Swapna Suresh alleging she was coerced to implicate the Chief Minister. The second FIR makes a similar allegation from a letter supposed to have written by another gold smuggling accused Sandeep Nair. Interestingly, the second FIR was filed while the hearing of the first FIR was underway, and saw the Counsel appearing for the ED allege that the facts of the two FIRs were the same.
When the filing of the second FIR was brought to the notice of the Court, the court ordered that investigation in the second FIR was to be deferred.
"There has to be some deference to the court. We were in the midst of hearing the other case", Justice Arun told the Prosecutor on this occasion.
In the first FIR officials of the ED have been booked for abetment, conspiracy, framing incorrect documents with intent to cause injury, fabrication of false evidence and threatening accused Swapna Suresh to give false evidence (sections 116, 120B, 167, 192, 193, 195A of the Indian Penal Code). In the second FIR offences of conspiracy and the punishment for fabrication of false evidence (sections 120B and 193 of the IPC) are notably absent.
Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta, Additional Solicitor Generals S V Raju and KM Nataraj had appeared for the ED. Senior Advocate Harin P Raval appeared for the State Government.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had submitted that the issue of "cooperative federalism" was involved in the case and law never contemplated one investigating agency examining the correctness of evidence collected by another agency. If the FIR is permitted, it will mean that no central agency can investigate in a state fearlessly and independently(Detailed account of SG's arguments may be read here).
 During one of the hearings ASG Raju for the ED argued that two FIRs were permissible only in a counter-case, and not where the FIRs were the same.
 "Sandeep was already there, so no discovery, no different version, it's the same thing, same wine in different bottle..I can understand if Sandeep was not in the first picture .. If test of sameness is applied, second FIR has to go. The first FIR has Swapna and Sandeep, you cannot pick out Sandeep from the first FIR and say the two FIRs are different," ASG Raju argued.
 The detailed hearings saw submissions on whether the investigation by the Crime Branch affected cooperative federalism, and elaborate deliberations on the scope of the provisions of the Indian Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure in question in the case.

The Supreme Court observed that it is the duty of a court to deal with issues/grounds raised in a writ petitions and thereafter to pass a reasoned order.
"When the Constitution confers on the High Courts the power to give relief it becomes the duty of the Courts to give such relief in appropriate cases and the Courts would be failing to perform their duty if relief is refused without adequate reasons.", the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna observed.
The court was considering appeals filed against judgments of the Bombay High Court dismissing writ petitions that challenged the reopening of the assessment/re­assessment proceedings under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act.
The Apex Court bench noted that, except stating that 'we are not inclined to entertain writ petition', the High Court had not dealt with any of the grounds raised in the writ petitions and there is no discussion at all on any of the grounds raised in the writ petitions.  
"The manner in which the High Court has dealt with and disposed of the writ petitions without passing any reasoned order is not appreciated by this Court. When a number of issues/grounds were raised in the writ petitions, it was the duty cast upon the court to deal with the same and thereafter, to pass a reasoned order. When the Constitution confers on the High Courts the power to give relief it becomes the duty of the Courts to give such relief in appropriate cases and the Courts would be failing to perform their duty if relief is refused without adequate reasons.", the court observed.
Referring to observations made in decisions viz. Central Board of Trustees Vs. Indore Composite Private Limited (2018) 8 SCC 443, Union Public Service Commission Vs. Bibhu Prasad Sarangi  (2021) 4 SCC 516, the court, while allowing the appeal, observed:
Applying the law laid by this Court in the aforesaid decisions to the facts of the case on hand and the manner in which the High Court has disposed of the writ petitions, in the interest of sobriety, we may only note that the orders are bereft of reasoning as diverse grounds were urged/raised by the parties which ought to have been examined by the High Court in the first place and a clear finding was required to be recorded upon analysing the relevant documents.. Since we cannot countenance the manner in which the orders have been passed by the High Court which has compelled us to remand the matter to the High Court for deciding the writ petitions afresh on merits, we do so in light of the aforesaid observations

The Supreme Court has held that Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act does not bar the bequeathing of a limited estate to a female by way of a Will; but if the limited estate is given to the wife for her maintenance, then it would mature into an absolute estate under Section 14(1) of the Act.

The Supreme Court has held that Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act does not bar the bequeathing of a limited estate to a female by way of a Will; but if the limited estate is given to the wife for her maintenance, then it would mature into an absolute estate under Section 14(1) of the Act.
 "The objective of Section 14(1) of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 cannot be that a Hindu male who owned self-acquired property is unable to execute a Will giving a limited estate to a female if all other aspects including maintenance are taken care of", the bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh observed.
The court added that Section 14(2) applies to a Will which creates an independent and new title in favour of females for the first time and is not a recognition of a pre-existing right.
Background
The Will dated 15.4.1968 by one Tulsi Ram bequeathed his estate to his son Jogi Ram (from his first wife) and his second wife Ram Devi. Ram Devi was given a limited ownership for her enjoyment during her lifetime with respect to her share of the land with a specific provision that she could not alienate, transfer or create third party rights over the same. Thereafter the property was to vest absolutely on Jogi Ram after her lifetime. Several rounds of litigations followed and finally, vide the impugned judgment, the High Court, interpreting Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act, held that Ram Devi's limited right would translate into an absolute right over the suit property as it was only a confirmation of the pre-existing right over the property.
In appeal filed by Jogi Ram, the Apex Court bench noted the contents of the Will as follows: 
The Will while conferring a limited estate on Ram Devi, Tulsi Ram had clearly stated that she will earn income from the property for her livelihood. The income, thus, generated from the property is what has been given for maintenance and not the property itself. That after the lifetime of Ram Devi, the appellant will get the ownership of the remaining half portion also. It is specified that in case Ram Devi pre-deceases Tulsi Ram, then all the properties would go absolutely to the appellant and that the other children will have no interest in the property.
What does Section 14 Hindu Succession Act say?
Section 14(1) provides that the any property possessed by a female Hindu, whether acquired before or after the commencement of the 1956 Act, shall be held by her as full owner thereof and not as a limited owner. 
The Explanation to the Section clarifies that the "property" includes both movable and immovable property acquired by a female Hindu by inheritance or devise, or at a partition, or in lieu of maintenance or arrears of maintenance, or by gift from any person, whether a relative or not, before, at or after her marriage, or by her own skill or exertion, or by purchase or by prescription, or in any other manner whatsoever, and also any such property held by her as stridhana immediately before the commencement of the Act.
 Section 14 (2) states that nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply to any property acquired by way of gift or under a will or any other instrument or under a decree or order of a civil court or under an award where the terms of the gift, will or other instrument or the decree, order or award prescribe a restricted estate in such property.
The appellant contended that the life estate was not given to Ram Devi in lieu of recognition of any pre-existing right of Ram Devi or in lieu of maintenance and, thus, Section 14(2) of the said Act would apply and not Section 14(1) of the said Act. According to the respondents, the rights of a female Hindu post the said Act have been crystallised into absolute estate. Referring to the dictum in V. Tulasamma & Ors. v. Sesha Reddy (Dead) by LRs, the respondents contended that Ram Devi's estate became absolute.
The court noted the following observation made in the conclusion part of the judgment in V. Tulasamma case:
(4) Sub-section (2) of s. 14 applies to instruments, decrees, awards, gifts etc. which create independent and new titles in favour of the females for the first time and has no application where the instrument concerned merely seeks to confirm, endorse, declare or recognise pre-existing rights. In such cases a restricted estate in favour of a female is legally permissible and s. 14(1) will not operate in this sphere. Where, however, an instrument merely declares or recognises a pre-existing right, such as a claim to maintenance or partition or share to which the female is entitled, the sub-section has absolutely no application and the female's limited interest would automatically be enlarged into an absolute one by force of s. 14(1) and the restrictions placed, if any, under the document would have to be ignored. Thus where a property is allotted or transferred to a female in lieu of maintenance or a share at partition, the instrument is taken out of the ambit of sub- s. (2) and would be governed by s. 14(1) despite any restrictions placed on the powers of the transferee.
Taking note of the precedents, the Supreme Court observed:
 "In our view the objective of sub-Section (2) above is quite clear as enunciated repeatedly by this Court in various judicial pronouncements, i.e., there cannot be a fetter in a owner of a  property to give a limited estate if he so chooses to do including to his wife but of course if the limited estate is to the wife for her maintenance that would mature in an absolute estate under Section 14(1) of the said Act".
The Court further observed:
30. In our view the relevant aspect of the aforesaid conclusion is para 4 which opines where sub-section (2) of Section 14 of the said Act would apply and this does inter alia applies to a Will which may create independent and new title in favour of females for the first time and is not a recognition of a pre-existing right. In such cases of a restricted estate in favour of a female is legally permissible and Section 14(1) of the said Act will not operate in that sphere. 31. We may add here that the objective of Section 14(1) is to create an absolute interest in case of a limited interest of the wife where such limited estate owes its origin to law as it stood then. The objective cannot be that a Hindu male who owned self-acquired property is unable to execute a Will giving a limited estate to a wife if all other aspects including maintenance are taken care of. If we were to hold so it would imply that if the wife is disinherited under the Will it would be sustainable but if a limited estate is given it would mature into an absolute interest irrespective of the intent of the testator. That cannot be the objective, in our view.
The court noted that the testator in the present case, Tulsi Ram, had taken all care for the needs of maintenance of his wife by ensuring that the revenue generated from the estate would go to her alone. 
"He, however, wished to give only a limited lift interest to her as the second wife with the son inheriting the complete estate after her lifetime. We are, thus, of the view that it would be the provisions of Section 14(2) of the said Act which would come into play in such a scenario and Ram Devi only had a life interest in her favour. The natural sequitur is that the respondents cannot inherit a better title than what the vendor had and, thus, the view taken by the trial court and the first appellate court is the correct view and the sale deeds in favour of the respondents cannot be sustained.", the court observed while allowing the appeal.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has recently granted regular bail to a woman booked under the Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1994, allegedly for accompanying the decoy witness to the place where the sex determination test was supposed to be conducted.
 After taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, role played by the petitioner, along with the fact that co-accused was already released on regular bail, the court deemed it appropriate to allow the instant petition releasing the petitioner on regular bail.
It was alleged that one Babita and the co-accused Sukhwinder Kaur went alongwith the decoy customer in the car, where they met the petitioner, who is alleged to have taken money from Sukhwinder Kaur. The petitioner is stated to have led the decoy customer to the house where the sex determination test was to be conducted upon the decoy customer.
The Petitioner contended that a sum of Rs.32,000/-, which was fixed as the cost for sex determination and was duly marked by the PNDT Team, was recovered from co-accused Sukhwinder Kaur. The role attributed to the petitioner is stated to be at par with co-accused Babita, who was already on bail.
It was further contended that the petitioner was neither a technical nor a professional employee of the place where the sex determination test is alleged to have taken place. Consequently, the provisions of Section 23 of the PNDT Act would not get attracted to the petitioner.Taking into consideration the facts and circumstances noticed above, role attributed to the petitioner, as also the fact that other similarly placed co-accused Babita has already been granted the concession of regular bail by the Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track Special Court to primarily try the cases of rape alongwith the offences of POCSO Act), Kurukshetra vide order dated 02.06.2022, I deem it appropriate to allow the instant petition.
 The bench comprising Justice Vinod S Bhardwaj noted that the similarly placed co-accused named Babita has already been granted regular bail by the Fast Track Special Court.
 Accordingly, the court while allowing the petition, ordered the petitioner to be released on regular bail. Court further made it clear that the petitioner shall not  threaten or influence any prosecution witnesses in any manner.
 Case Title: DEEPA @ DEEPIKA Versus STATE OF HARYANA

The Jammu and Kashmir & Ladakh High Court recently observed that filing of multiple criminal proceedings against the same accused by an informant for the same alleged offence is prohibited in law. 
"Getting an accused entangled in multiple criminal proceedings in same alleged offence would be an abuse of process of law, which cannot stand the scrutiny of the Article 21 and 22 of the Constitution," a bench comprising Justices Javed Iqbal Wani observed relying on Apex Court's decision in Tarak Dash Mukharjee vs State of Uttar Pradesh.
The bench was hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had challenged successive complaints filed against him by the complainants and also the setting into motion process thereof by the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Srinagar.
The respondents/complainants had filed a complaint before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Srinagar, alleging fraud and misappropriation of funds of an educational society namely “Tyndale Biscoe and Mallinson Society Kashmir” into their personal assets and also for misappropriating grants provided by the government worth crores of rupees to the Society and the Schools in violation of rules of the Society.
Simultaneously another complaint was filed by the complainants in the year 2019 alleging the same acts of omission and commission committed by the petitioners. As this matter was closed due to non-appearance, the complainants filed another complaint and a report indicating that enquiry is at its final stage was filed by the Crime Branch. 
Petitioner alleged that notwithstanding this fact, the complainant instead of pursuing the complaints filed before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Srinagar under enquiry before the Crime Branch filed another complaint before the Director Industries and Commerce, Kashmir, being Registrar of Societies under J&K Societies Registration Act, on same set of allegations.
Sr Adv Sunil Sethi for the petitioner contended that complainants have been continuously subjecting the petitioners to harassment and persecution by filing unfounded successive complaints on same set of allegations.
Mr. S. H. Thakur, appearing counsel for the respondents/complainants contended that the complainants are the members of a Christian Missionary Society and have as such a right to secure and protect the interests of the Society and the schools being run and operated by it.
Justice Wani observed that the sum and substance of the allegations levelled by the complainants against the petitioners are of fraud, cheating and misappropriation of the funds of the Society and the Schools, besides to breach of trust. "Indisputably neither the Society nor the Schools are the complainants alleging the said acts of omission and commission against the petitioners in relation to their affairs, funds or properties and hence complainants don't have any locus to claim having been suffered on account of alleged offences at the hands of the petitioners," the bench said. 
It noted that the complainants had successively filed complaints against the petitioners on the same set of allegations, be it before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Srinagar, Inspector General of Police, SSP Crime Branch, Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir, Director Industries and Commerce Kashmir, Registrar under Societies and Registration Act, Kashmir, amongst which two complaints and actions initiated thereupon came to be quashed by the High Court. 
Observing that the instant case is glaring example of an abuse of process of law taken recourse to by complainants/respondents by filing successive complaints against the petitioners, Justice Wani lamented the entire exercise undertaken by the complainants/respondents and the manner abuse of the process of the law had been resorted to. 
In the court’s quest for doing justice, Justice Wani not only allowed the petitions and quashed the impugned complaints but also burdened the respondents/complainants with Rs 50,000/- to be paid towards the petitioners within a period of eight weeks.

A group of 140 lawyers submits a letter petition before the Chief Justice of India again the internet shutdown imposed in parts of Delhi-NCR during the ongoing farmers protests.#FarmersProtests #InternetShutdowns pic.twitter.com/PlxUVRqny3— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) February 3, 2021 
After the farmers' Republic Day tractor rally turned violent, the Ministry of Home Affairs ordered temporary suspension of Internet services in several parts of Delhi. This order was extended after violent encounters at Singhu Border on January 29, and internet services at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri border areas remains suspended.
 As per the Government, it is necessary to suspend Internet services "in the interest of maintaining public safety and averting public emergency".
 In the letter petition, the lawyers alleged that the violence was perpetrated by local hoodlums. It is alleged that about 200 men claiming to be local residents barged into the protest site at Singhu Border to vacate the area and pelted stones, damaged properties, and attacked the protestors despite the presence of heavy security of the police.
 The lawyers have thus urged the Supreme Court to take suo moto cognizance of the issue and restrain the Central Government from imposing further Internet shutdowns at the protest sites and adjoining areas.
 The letter drafted by Advocates Sitwat Nabi and Abhisht Hela stated :
"As internet services remain suspended in and around the protest venues and its adjoining areas for the sixth consecutive day, farmers are rightly convinced that their voices are being shunned down and only one-sided narrative of the government is being pushed forward, which is a clear attack on the fundamental values of the Constitution."
 Reliance is placed on Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, (2020) 3 SCC 637 and Foundation for Media Professionals v. Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir & Another (2020) 5 SCC 746, where the Supreme Court had observed,
 "access to the Internet is a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution, subject to some restrictions and said freedom of the press is a valuable and sacred right."
 The Supreme Court had cautioned that magistrates, while passing prohibitory orders, should apply their mind and follow the doctrine of proportionality.
 The lawyers have also opposed erection of multi-layer barricading at Delhi's Ghazipur border, turning the protest sites into a fortress where it seems like they are waging war against their own men. 
 The letter states,
 "Embedding more than 2000 iron nails, multi-layer metal barricades, cement walls, and heavily armed security officials- these cannot be considered as law-and-order situations. This should be rather termed as fortification! These activities are depriving the protesting farmers of their basic human rights and are in gross violation of the Right to Life enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution."
 Inter alia, they have contended that the plight of the farmers is worsening because of the biased reporting by few mainstream media channels. 
 It is denigrating the peaceful protest and is only adding fuel to the blazing fire. Labeling farmers as "terrorists" by the mainstream media and airing provocative content, the letter states.
 In this backdrop, the lawyers have urged the Supreme Court to set up a Commission of Enquiry to probe into:
 Police inaction in controlling the violence and the role of the Delhi Police in allegedly facilitating the mob attack on 29 January, 2021 and failing to ensure peace and security.Action against the 200 local hoodlums who allegedly engaged in the manhandling of protestors, and journalists at the Singhu Protest venue.Strict action against the journalists and the news channels who are allegedly spreading provocative content and fake rumors about the farmers and their protest.
 "This must be done immediately in order to stop the gross injustice which is tarnishing the fabric of our Constitution and causing colossal damage to the sheen of a democratic country. History will not pardon us if we remain mute spectators to this violation of human rights," the letter states.

The Supreme Court has held that the rule that employees cannot raise a dispute relating to date of birth at the fag end of their service is equally applicable to employers as well.
A bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and Aniruddha Bose set aside the decision of Hindustan Copper Ltd, a Public Sector Undertaking, to reduce the VRS benefits to an employee by altering his date of birth.
The employee's stand was that his date of birth is September 21, 1949. However, the employer reckoned his date of birth as September 21, 1945 for computing the benefits of Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS). If the latter date, i.e. 21st September, 1949 was accepted by the employer to be his date of birth, his financial benefits from the said scheme would have been higher, as he would have had longer service tenure left.
He approached the High Court challenging the company's action. After being unsuccessful there, he approached the Supreme Court. The High Court had held that there were no records to prove that his date of birth was in 1949.
The admitted position was that 21st September 1949 was recorded as his date of birth in his service book. This was opened in 1975.The appellant claimed that at the time of his voluntary retirement, he came to learn for the first time that his date of birth was being changed to 21st September 1945. The "Form B" in the records reflected the 1945 date of birth. The employer maintained that the entry in the service book was an error which was corrected later.
The Supreme Court observed that "the authorities proceeded in this matter in a rather mechanical manner and embarked on a unilateral exercise of correcting the age entry in the service book on their perception that an error was being corrected".
"This exercise was conducted without giving any opportunity of hearing to the appellant and at the fag end of his service tenure. Otherwise, various documents including the L.I.C. policy consistently reflect 21st September 1949 to be the appellant's birthdate", the Court observed.
"This is not a case where a workman is seeking to change his date of birth to his benefit at the end of his career. This is a case where the employer is altering the records at the end of the career of the workman to his detriment on taking unilateral decision that the date of birth specified in the appellant's service book was erroneous, relying on a date disclosed in a statutory form", the Court noted.
The Court observed that the employer changed the date of birth without giving an opportunity of hearing to the employee. The Court added that VRS benefits are covered under the Right to Property under Article 300A of the Constitution.
"VRS benefit is an entitlement and assumes the character of property to the employee concerned once his application for VRS is accepted. It is the right of a person under Article 300A of the Constitution of India to have the VRS benefit to be given on accurate assessment thereof, the employer here being a public sector unit. If at the time of quantifying the VRS benefit after accepting an employee's application for voluntary retirement, the employer take any step that would reduce such benefit in monetary terms, such step shall have to be taken under the authority of law.
 We find the action of the employer lacking in authority of law in this case on two counts. First, it fails for not adhering to the principles of natural justice. The decision not to follow the service book recordal was taken without giving an opportunity of hearing to the appellant. The opportunity of hearing of the appellant also accrued because the employer themselves had proceeded on the basis that the later date i.e., 21st September 1949 was the birthdate of the appellant and this was a long established position. Moreover, since in the own records of the employer two dates were shown, under normal circumstances it would have been incumbent on their part to undertake an exercise on application of mind to determine in which of these two records the mistake had crept in. That process would also have had to involve participation of the appellant, which would have been compatible with the principles of natural justice. 
There are several authorities in which this Court has deprecated the practice on the part of the employees at the fag end of their career to dispute the records pertaining to their dates of birth that would have the effect of extension of the length of their service. The very reasoning on which an employee is not permitted to raise age­-correction plea at the fag end of his service to extend his tenure should also apply to the employer as well. It is the employer here who had proceeded on the basis of age of the appellant reflected in his service book during the latter's service tenure and they ought not to be permitted to fall back on the Form "B" which would curtail the VRS benefit of the appellant".
Allowing the appeal, the Court directed the respondents to extend the benefits of VRS to the appellant treating his date of birth as 21st September 1949.Such benefits shall be extended to him within a period of four months, upon deducting therefrom the sum already paid to him. The differential amount shall carry simple interest at the rate of seven percent (7%) per annum to be computed from 3rd October 2002, being the date on which he was released from service, till the date of actual payment to him in terms of this judgment.

Head Notes
Voluntary Retirement Scheme - VRS benefit is an entitlement and assumes the character of property to the employee concerned once his application for VRS is accepted. It is the right of a person under Article 300A of the Constitution of India to have the VRS benefit to be given on accurate assessment thereof, the employer here being a public sector unit. If at the time of quantifying the VRS benefit after accepting an employee's application for voluntary retirement, the employer take any step that would reduce such benefit in monetary terms, such step shall have to be taken under the authority of law (Paragraph 21).
Service Law - There are several authorities in which this Court has deprecated the practice on the part of the employees at the fag end of their career to dispute the records pertaining to their dates of birth that would have the effect of extension of the length of their service. The very reasoning on which an employee is not permitted to raise age­-correction plea at the fag end of his service to extend his tenure should also apply to the employer as well(Paragraph 21).

While confirming the order of the single judge dismissing a challenge to the provisional attachment under Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988, the Madras High Court held that there is no provision for providing an opportunity to cross examine the witnesses from whom they have collected the information regarding benami property, at the preliminary stage and therefore,...
While confirming the order of the single judge dismissing a challenge to the provisional attachment under Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988, the Madras High Court held that there is no provision for providing an opportunity to cross examine the witnesses from whom they have collected the information regarding benami property, at the preliminary stage and therefore, the question of violation of the principles of natural justice does not arise at the preliminary stage. It is applicable only during the adjudicatory proceedings.
 A division bench of Justice R Mahadevan and Justice Sathya Narayana Prasad observed:
 "The provisions of law mandate the respondent authorities to furnish such documents, particulars or evidence and provide an opportunity of being heard to the appellant only at the stage of adjudication proceedings; and there is no provision under the Act to provide an opportunity to the appellant to cross examine the witnesses at the preliminary stage."
 The court also opined that the proceedings under Section 24 of the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 only required a recording of prima facie opinion as to the benami nature of the transaction. In the present case, the appellant was issued a show cause notice under Section 24(1) of the Act to which he failed to reply. Thus, the order of the adjudicating authority was after making enquiry and calling for reports or evidence and taking into account all the relevant materials.
It is to be pointed out that the applicability of the principles of natural justice and fair play, depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is subjected to statutory provisions; and that, the proceedings under section 24 only require a recording of prima facie opinion as to the benami nature of the transaction. It is an admitted case that the appellant failed to submit his reply to the notice issued under section 24(1). As such, the first respondent, after making enquiry and calling for reports or evidence and taking into account all the relevant materials, has, with the prior approval of the Approving Authority, passed the order under section 24(4), continuing the provisional attachment of the property till the passing of the order by the Adjudicating Authority under section 26(3), which is purely provisional in nature.
In the present case, the appellant contended that he was in the business of money lending, chit fund etc and in 2017 a search was conducted in his premises consequent to the search in the case of Mrs V.K Sasikala. During the course of the same, various documents were impounded and sworn statements were recorded. Subsequently, the appellant received notices under section 153C of the Act alleging that he had received a sum of Rs.18 crores towards his share in the Spectrum Mall located at Perambur, Chennai.
 The appellant contended that he received show cause notice under section 24(1) of the Act as if he is the binamidar for Mrs V.K Sasikala. His prime contention was that he was not involved in the alleged transactions. He also submitted that he was not provided with the entire documents relied upon by the respondent department for initiating the proceedings nor was he given an opportunity to cross examine the witnesses before the order under Section 24(4) of the Act was passed. He also relied on Section 24(4)(a)(ii) of the Act and submitted that the respondent was empowered to revoke the entire proceedings if the appellant was able to satisfy that the transaction was not benami in nature. But here he was not given an opportunity.
 He thus contended that the act of the respondent was against the provisions of law and the principles of natural justice. The single judge had erred in holding that the process and procedure as envisaged for provisional attachment under Section 24 is of narrower compass when compared to the process of adjudication to follow thereafter. 
 The respondent department submitted that there was prima facie material available to show that the appellant was a benamidar and that the non existence of memorandum of Understanding will not vitiate the proceedings. It was submitted that the order under Section 24(4) was passed after proper application of mind and after having reasons to believe so. Sufficient opportunities were also provided to the appellant to file his objections in adherence to the principles of natural justice and therefore, the impugned order does not warrant any interference. 
 Relying on legal precedents of various courts in the country, the court opined that in the absence of any provision of law or compelling circumstances, the plea raised by the appellant that he was not given an opportunity of cross examination cannot be countenanced. It observed as under:
 In the given factual backdrop and applying the legal proposition as enunciated in the earlier paragraph, we are of the opinion that in the absence of any provision of law as well as the compelling circumstances warranting the respondent authorities to provide an opportunity of cross examination of witnesses, whose statements have been relied on by the respondent authorities to the appellant at the stage of section 24 proceedings, the plea raised by the appellant in this regard, cannot be countenanced. Therefore, we do not find any error in the order passed by the first respondent, as an interim measure, continuing the provisional attachment order of the property till the passing of the order under section 26(3) by the adjudicating authority.
 The court thus dismissed the writ appeals observing that the appellant had not made out any case to interfere with the order of the court below.

The Delhi High Court has observed that while considering bail, damocles sword cannot be allowed to hang over the accused's head merely on the assumption that the proceeds of crime may be higher.
Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar made the observation while granting anticipatory bail to a man in connection with a money laundering case registered by the Enforcement Directorate, related to the alleged fertilizers scam.
"Merely on the assumption of the respondent that till date what has been uncovered is may be the tip of the iceberg and the proceeds of the crime may be much higher, damocles sword cannot be allowed to hang over the head of the petitioner when there are no allegations against him of threatening any witness in the investigation and as far as the factual matrix is concerned, those are matter of trial," the Court said.
CBI had registered a case on 17th May 2021 under Sections 120B, 420 IPC and Sections 13(1)(d) r/w Sec. 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 against Singh and other accused persons.
It was alleged that the accused persons entered into a criminal conspiracy from 2007 to 2014 and cheated and defrauded IFFCO and Indian Potash Limited (IPL), its shareholders and the Government of India by allegedly and fraudulently importing fertilizers and other materials for fertilizer production at inflated prices by claiming higher subsidy from Government of India causing loss of several crores of rupees.
It was also alleged that they had siphoned off the commission received from the suppliers through a complex web of fake commercial transactions through multiple companies owned by the accused persons, registered outside India in order to camouflage the fraudulent transactions.
In August, the Court had granted bail to RJD Rajya Sabha MP Amrendra Dhari Singh in the matter. 
It was thus the applicant's case that he has apprehension of his arrest as he is one of the directors of M/s Alankit Limited which had been arrayed as an accused in the case.
He also submitted that during the course of investigation, he had joined the investigation more than 20 times and had co-operated in the investigation by providing all the information and documents as per his knowledge. 
"The statements of the witnesses U/s 50 of PMLA have already been recorded and there is only an apprehension that the petitioner would tamper with the evidence or threaten the witnesses but till date nothing has been placed on record to show that any such attempt has been made by the petitioner in this regard and there appears to be only an apprehension in this regard," the Court said.
The Court also noted that other co-accused were already released on regular bail along with the fact that there was nothing to show that as to for what purpose, the custodial interrogation of the applicant was required.
Accordingly, bail was granted by the Court.

The Court was adjudicating upon a batch of...
The Calcutta High Court on Thursday ordered the West Bengal Central School Service Commission to immediately stop the payment of salary to the 25 appointees of Group-D' (non-teaching staff) who had been allegedly been appointed after the expiration of the panel prepared for giving appointments to the post of Group-D in the Education Department. The Court was adjudicating upon a batch of petitions contending alleged irregularities in the appointment of 'Group-C' and 'Group-D' (non-teaching staff) in sponsored Secondary and Higher Secondary schools under the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE) on the purported recommendation by the West Bengal Central School Service Commission (WBSSC).
Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay at the outset noted that a Division Bench of the High Court had stayed his earlier order wherein a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe had been ordered into the alleged irregularities in appointments of non-teaching staff. A Division Bench comprising Justices Harish Tandon and Rabindranath Samanta on Wednesday had issued the following order, 
"We find that a prima facie case is made out by the appellants. The impugned order, so far as it relates to the enquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation is concerned, is stayed for a period of three weeks from date or until further order/orders of this Court, whichever is earlier"
Accordingly, Justice Gangopadhyay on Thursday noted that only the direction for a CBI enquiry had been stayed by the Division Bench and not the entire proceedings. As a result, he observed, 
"Which such facts have already come to light that recommendations were made after expiry of the panel in respect of 25 persons, I am of the view that no amount of argument will change those facts and nobody will be able to change those facts by making submissions. The facts will remain the facts whether any submission are made or not. If recommendations are made illegally and appointments are made on the basis of those illegal recommendations, those who have been appointed in a school as Group-D staff cannot have any right to get the salary from the public exchequer"
Furthermore, the Court also took on record a supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners containing a tabular list stipulating the recommendation letters or the appointment letters which have come into their possession. Accordingly, the Commission was directed to scrutinize the documents annexed to the supplementary affidavit to see whether any recommendation was made after the expiry of the panel. 
"If the School Service Commission finds that recommendations from the said list were made after expiry of the panel, they will issue letters immediately to the concerned District Inspector of Schools for stopping the salary of such persons until further order of this Court", the Court ordered further. 
The Court further directed the Commission to serve a copy of the supplementary affidavit by speed post with A/D only to the persons in favour of whom recommendation letters have been issued after the expiry of the panel so that they are kept informed.
The matter has been listed for further hearing on December 9 at 2pm. 
Case Title: Sandeep Prasad & Ors v. State of West Bengal & Ors

The Himachal Pradesh High Court has recently observed that it is a misconception that water belongs to the villagers who use the same. Water is the property of the State and no individual has any right to claim this as his property, even though the same might be situated within his personal property, it clarified.
The bench comprising Justices Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Virender Singh made these observations in a plea through the medium of which the petitioners had challenged the construction of proposed dam (bandh) on Bagna nalla somewhere in between villages of Balaog and Bawana near Shimla. 
In their plea the petitioners submitted that by the said act of the respondents 90 to 95% inhabitants of Gram Panchayat Dhamoon, will be affected as their very source of livelihood would be snatched. Majority of the inhabitants of these panchayats are unemployed and are, thus, dependent on agriculture, they averred in their petition. 
After hearing the contentions raised the bench observed that there cannot be any two opinions that natural resources are the assets of the nation and It is the obligation of all concerned, including the Central and the State Governments, to conserve and not waste such valuable resources. 
Highlighting the Constitutional provisions under Article 48A and 51A prescribing the duties of the Sate in matters of environment, the bench siad that the said constitutional provisions, clearly propounded the doctrine of public trust and the said doctrine rests on the principle that certain resources like air, sea, water and forests are of such great importance to the people as a whole that it would be highly unjustifiable to make them a subject of private ownership. 
Elaborating further on the matter the bench underscored that the State holds all the water bodies in public trust for the welfare of this generation and all the succeeding generations and, therefore, protecting water bodies must be given as much weightage as haz been given to allowing house-sites or other buildings to come up on such tanks poramboke lands, and water charged lands.
Pointing towards the adequate steps already taken by the respondents to safeguard the interests of the petitioners, the court said that the project in question is being undertaken for the benefit of public at large by maintaining the necessary flow of water in the khud down stream for running of gharat and irrigation channels.
Taking note of the fact that the Gram Panchayat had already passed a resolution im favour of the project and issued no objection certificate in consequences for its construction the bench observed, 
"Only four people, that two residents from village Bawana, one each from village Shilru and Panti have filed the instant petition, therefore, the same cannot be termed to be the voice of the people,as the voice of the people would be best reflected if the local rural elected bodies like gram panchayat or gram sabha would come up before the court".
Terming the petition as more of a speculation as the interests of the petitioners have been adequately safeguarded and protected while formulating and implementing the scheme for raising construction of bandh, the bench dismissed the same finding it devoid of any merit.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that it has only to be after 5/6 years in case the appeal is not disposed of, that suspension of sentence and grant of bail under Section 389 CrPC be considered, in a heinous case like murder.
 The bench comprising Justices Ali Mohammad Magrey and MD Akram Chowdhary was hearing an appeal alongside an application through the medium of which the appellant sought suspension of sentence and grant of bail pending appeal filed by him as well as Criminal Reference received from the court of Principal Sessions Judge Pulwama, having been aggrieved of his conviction for the commission of offences punishable under Section 302 and 392 RPC.
 Alongside his appeal the appellant in his application for suspension of sentence and grant of bail asserted that the appellant since his arrest on 11.04.2011 has been in continuous custody and has completed 10 years and 10 months in jail, though he is a man of clean antecedents with history of not involved in any criminal matter or case. The appellant further contended that he has preferred an appeal against his conviction and sentence and is sure that he will succeed in the appeal. It was also argued that the entire case rests on circumstantial evidence and there is no eye witness to the alleged incident and that there was no independent witness has been examined by the prosecution and all the witnesses were either relatives or close friends of the complainant.
 Lastly the appellant argued that since the appeal is a continuation of trial under legal fiction, therefore, inordinate delay in disposal of the case entitles the appellant to suspension of sentence and grant of bail and therefore the sentence be suspended, and as a consequence the appellant-convict be admitted to bail till disposal of appeal.
 Contesting the application the respondent countered by stating that when the conviction has already been recorded by the trial court, the appellant-convict cannot ask for concession of suspension of sentence and grant of bail for 'no pressing' reason. Mere detention of the convict, in a case where he has been awarded life imprisonment, for more than a decade, will not entitle him to such a relief. AAG finally prayed that the application moved in this behalf may be rejected, the respondent contended.
 Adjudicating upon the matter the bench observed that while considering the application for suspension of sentence and grant of bail, the appellate court is not required to consider the evidence on record meticulously lest it should affect the merits of the case while considering the main appeal. The appellate court has to consider the case just to find out whether there is prima facie case to hold that there has been some miscarriage of justice which may be apparent on the face of the record and in such situation the suspension of sentence can be ordered and as a consequence the appellant can be released on bail, the bench recorded.
 Placing firm reliance on the Supreme Court judgements in Ramji Prasad Vs. Rattan Kumar Jaiswal & Ors., reported as (2002) and Kishori Lal Vs. Rupa & Ors., reported as 2004  the bench observed that where an accused was found guilty by the trial court under Section 302 IPC, the normal practice in such cases is not to suspend the sentence and it is only in exceptional cases like nature of accusation, manner in which the crime is alleged to have been committed, gravity of the offence and the desirability of releasing the accused on bail after they have been convicted for committing the serious offence of murder, that the benefit of suspension of sentence can be granted.
 "There is a distinction between bail and suspension of sentence. One of the essential ingredients of Section 389 is the requirement for the appellant court to record reasons in writing for ordering suspension of execution of the sentence or order appealed. The requirement of recording reasons in writing clearly indicates that there has to be careful consideration of the relevant aspects and the order directing suspension of sentence and grant of bail should not be passed as a matter of routine", the bench explained.
 Elaborating on the law laid down by the Supreme court recently in Satender Kumar Antil Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation & Anr., on which the appellant had placed reliance the bench observed that where a person has been found guilty of offence punishable under Section 302 IPC and sentenced for life imprisonment, the Code of Criminal Procedure affords right of appeal to such a convict, however, a difficulty arises when the appeal preferred by such convict cannot be disposed of within a reasonable time. Where court is not in a position to dispose of the appeal for 5/6 years would indeed be a travesty of justice to keep a person in jail for a period of 5/6 years for an offence which is ultimately found not to have been committed by him. Hence it has only to be after 5/6 years in case the appeal is not disposed of, that suspension of sentence and grant of bail be considered, in a heinous case like murder, the bench underscored.
 Accordingly in the case at hand the appeal which was filed on 04.02.2022 cannot be said to be pending for the last 4/5 years as required by the Hon'ble Apex Court. For the foregoing reasons and discussions made hereinabove, we are of the considered opinion that the appellant has failed to make out a prima facie case for suspension of sentence and grant of bail in his favour and his application is accordingly rejected, the bench concluded.

A single bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court has recommended departmental action against a Chief Judicial Magistrate for violating a High Court direction in a case.
Observing that the Magistrate's action not only showed lack of understanding of fundamental principles of law but also reflected judicial indiscipline, Justice Manoj Bajaj referred the matter to the Chief Justice for initiating departmental action.
"This Court has no hesitation in holding that Chief Judicial Magistrate, Yamuna Nagar has passed the impugned order by giving irrational reasons, which not only show his dearth of understanding criminal jurisprudence and fundamental principles of law, but also reflect judicial indiscipline on his part, which amounts to grave misconduct and warrants departmental action against him," Justice Bajaj observed in the order.
The controversy relates to the CJM refusing to refund an amount of Rs 1,10,000 deposited by an accused in a case as a bail condition, despite a direction to that effect by the High Court.
When the trial in the case had ended in acquittal, the accused had moved the High Court seeking refund of the deposit. The High Court directed the CJM to refund the same. However, the CJM refused to allow the refund citing the appeal filed by the complainant against the acquittal. In this backdrop, the accused approached the High Court again, challenging the CJM's refusal to allow refund. While allowing this application, Justice Bajaj made the observations against the CJM.
The Court had called for an explanation from the CJM for his refusal to follow the HC direction. The CJM explained that he had "mistakenly refused to refund the amount as directed by this Court, and regretted inconvenience caused to this Court".
"The expression and reasoning contained in the impugned order do not show that the disobedience of the direction by this Court was erroneous as claimed in the explanation, therefore, the same is not worth acceptance", Justice Bajaj noted.

The Allahabad High Court has clarified that for seeking appointment as Judicial Officer/District Judge as per Article 233 (2) of the Constitution of India, an Advocate has to be in continuous practice for not less than 7 years [with no break in between] as on the cut-off date and at the time of appointment as District Judge.
It may be noted that Article 233 of the Constitution of India deals with the Appointment of district judges and its subclause (2) mandates that a person, not already in the service of the Union or of the State, shall only be eligible to be appointed a district judge if he has been for not less than seven years, an advocate or a pleader, and is recommended by the High Court for the appointment.
The Bench of Justice Dr. Kaushal Jayendra Thaker and Justice Ajai Tyagi relied upon the apex court's ruling in the case of Deepak Aggrawal v. Keshav Kaushik and others, (2013) 5 SCC 277, wherein it had been held that as per Article 233(2), a person seeking appointment as a District Judge must be practicing as an advocate for continuous 7 years (without any break) on the date of application.
The case in brief
Essentially, the Court was dealing with a plea filed by one Bindu who applied for being appointed as a Judicial Officer/District judge in the U.P. State Higher Judicial Services, however, after she cleared the preliminary exam, she was not permitted to appear for the final exams by the High Court on the administrative side on the ground that she does not have continuous practice as an advocate for seven years on the date of exam/filling form. 
Against this backdrop, she moved to the Court praying that she be allowed to sit for the final examination.
Court's observations 
The Court noted that the petitioner ceased to be an Advocate under the Advocates Act, 1961 in August 2017 when she got selected as EXAMINER OF TRADEMARK & G.I. as in August 2017 she surrendered her practicing licence. 
Thereafter in the year 2019, she was selected as Public Prosecutor in CBI where she is still working, however, the Court noted that she is a Public Prosecutor at present but as Public Prosecutor, she has not put in continuous service of 7 years so that she becomes eligible to sit for the final examination.
"It is clear from the factual data that petitioner cannot seek appointment as Judicial Officer/District Judge in this calendar year as the petitioner does not fulfill the criteria fixed as per provisions of Articles 233, 234, and 236 of the Constitution of India...The term used "has been" [used under Article 233 (2)] is interpreted to mean seven years and has to be in present perfect continuous tense and not has been seven years during any period. This interpretation will not permit us to entertain this petition and grant the mandamus to permit the petitioner to appear in the exam," " the Court held.
Significantly, the Court also underscored that when the petitioner was employed as an examiner of trademark & GI [during the period between 2017 to 2019], there was a break in her legal practice and this break can't be condoned in view of the clear mandate of Article 233 and the concerned rules. In view of these facts, this petition was dismissed.

The Delhi High Court has dismissed a claim of invalidity against Burger King Corporation (BKC)'s registered trademark ‘Burger King’.
In response to a trademark infringement suit filed by the Burger King Corporation in 2018, the defendants had argued that BKC's registered trademark is liable to be cancelled. The court considered whether the case of the defendants on this account is "prima facie tenable". 
Justice Amit Bansal said defendants have failed to place any material in support of their submission that the trademark ‘Burger King’ is either generic or common to trade.
The court also said that it cannot be denied that BKC has used the trademark 'BURGER KING' since 1954 and holds registrations for it in over 122 countries including India.
"I am of the considered view that the plea raised by the defendant with regard to the invalidity of registrations granted in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the trademark BURGER KING and other formative marks, is prima facie not tenable. There is no reasonable prospect of the defendants succeeding in the cancellation petitions filed by them. Therefore, no issue with regard to validity of the registrations of trademarks of the plaintiff is liable to be framed in the facts and circumstances of the present case."
The suit filed by BKC seeks permanent injunction restraining the defendants from infringing its trademark ‘Burger King’. In 2018, an interim injunction was confirmed by the court in favour of BKC restraining the defendants from using the trademark ‘Burger King’ or any other deceptively similar mark. The appeal against the order is pending before a division bench.
In the February 18, 2020 order, the court had noted that one of the defences raised by the defendants in their written statement is that the BKC's registered trademark ‘Burger King’ is liable to be cancelled. 
The counsel for BKC argued that it has used the trademark ‘Burger King’ since 1954 and the mark has acquired secondary meaning and is exclusively associated with the plaintiff. The court was also told that the plaintiff has obtained registrations of the trademark ‘Burger King’ in over 122 countries.
The counsel appearing for the defendants submitted that they adopted the trademark Burger King in the year 1970 and since then they have extensively used the mark in respect of their business. The plaintiff has no exclusive right in the word ‘Burger’ as the same is generic and common to trade and the word ‘King’ is laudatory, it was argued.
It was also argued that registrations of BKC are liable to be rectified on various grounds including on the ground of 'non-user' under Section 47 of the Trade Marks Act. The rectification petitions were filed by defendants in November, 2014 and therefore, the relevant period of five years to be considered in terms of Section 47 (1) (b) of the Act would commence from three months before the date of filing of the aforesaid rectification petitions, i.e., August, 2009 to August, 2014.
Justice Bansal explained that Section 47(1)(b) of the Act provides that a registered trademark may be removed from the register of trademarks if up to a date of three months before the date of cancellation application, a continuous period of five years or longer has elapsed from the date on which the trademark was entered in the register and during which period, there was no bonafide use of the mark by the registered proprietor in relation to the said goods.
However, the court also noted that Section 47(3) also contains an exception to Section 47(1)(b) and provides that if the 'non-use' of a trademark is on account of special circumstances and not on account of intention to abandon or not to use the trademark, the provisions of Section 47(1)(b) will not apply.
Justice Bansal said there was 'bona fide use' on behalf of the plaintiff of the trademark 'BURGER KING' in the relevant period between August, 2009 and August, 2014 and there was no intention on behalf of the plaintiff to abandon the trademark. 
"It may be relevant to note that as a consequence of the preparatory work carried out by the plaintiff, the first BURGER KING restaurant was opened in India on 9th November, 2014 and as on date there are more than 300 BURGER KING Restaurants in India," it added.
The court also said the defendants are estopped from taking a plea that the trademark 'BURGER KING' is generic and common to trade when they have themselves sought for registration of the said marks.

The Supreme Court observed that when a clear case is made out for the offences alleged, the criminal proceedings cannot be quashed merely on the ground that "no useful purpose will be served by prolonging the proceedings of the case".
The bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna reiterated that a High Court must pass a speaking and reasoned order while disposing petitions under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
In this case, the Magistrate summoned the accused to face the trial for the offences punishable under Sections 307, 504, 506 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3(10)(15) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Allowing the petition filed by the accused challenging this order, the Allahabad High Court quashed the criminal proceedings merely opining that "that no useful purpose shall be served by prolonging the proceedings of the case".
Before the Apex court, the appellant contended that there is no independent application of mind by the High Court and no reasons whatsoever have been assigned while quashing the criminal proceedings. On the other hand, the respondent defended the impugned order.
The court noted that the High Court has not discussed the allegations made against the accused persons and even on the legality and validity of the order passed by the Magistrate summoning the accused. 
"The impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is a cryptic, non­ speaking order. We find no independent application of mind by the High Court on the legality and validity of the order passed by the learned Magistrate summoning the accused. The learned Magistrate issued the summons against the accused after considering the statements of the complainant as well as the witnesses recorded under Sections 200 & 202 Cr.P.C. and after considering the evidence on record including the injury certificate. The same has been set aside by the High Court in a most cursory and casual manner. The manner in which the High Court has disposed of the application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and quashed the criminal proceedings is not appreciated at all. In a catena of decisions, this Court has emphasized that the High Court must pass a speaking and reasoned order in such matters".
While allowing the appeal, the bench further observed: 
Even from the impugned order passed by the High Court it appears that while quashing the criminal proceedings, the High Court has observed that no useful purpose will be served by prolonging the proceedings of the case. The aforesaid cannot be a good ground and/or a ground at all to quash the criminal proceedings when a clear case was made out for the offences alleged. 6.4 The High Court has not at all observed on how the order passed by the learned Magistrate summoning the accused was wrong and/or erroneous. The manner in which the High Court has disposed of the application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and has quashed the criminal proceedings is deprecated. When serious allegations for the offences under Sections 307, 504, 506 of the IPC and 9 Section 3(10)(15) of the Act were made, the High Court ought to have been more cautious and circumspect while considering the application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and quashing the criminal proceedings for the aforesaid offences.

The Bombay High Court on Thursday confirmed the death sentence awarded to a convict who raped and murdered a 3 year 9 months old girl, who had ventured out of her house to play with her dog.
Confirming the death sentence awarded by Special POCSO Judge, Thane, the Bench of Justice Sadhana S. Jadhav and Justice Prithviraj K. Chavan observed thus:
"A bud of rose was crushed before it bloomed, a kite was torn when about to fly, the budding flower was crushed to ashes and the kite took the soul away."This is yet another sad saga of a three-year-old girl child, who was playing with her little dog, when she was noticed by a knave man who was driven by a desire of lust upon the sight of a little happy harmless child playing in her own world."
Case background 
The victim girl ventured out of her house to play with her dog and when she did not return home, her father lodged a missing report. Three days later, she was found lying in a mud pond.
The autopsy on the dead body of the child showed that she had been brutally sexually abused before she was put to death. The cause of death was "death due to head injury with extensive genital injuries."
The accused was charge-sheeted for offence punishable under sections 302, 363, 376 (2) (i), 201 of the Indian Penal Code, and sections 4 and 8 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.
The trial commenced and he was awarded the death penalty by the Lower Court.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court agreed with the APP that the act committed by the accused was gruesome and revolts human conscience and it was a gruesome act, committed in a diabolic manner. It was also argued that the act of the accused by itself would show that the question of any other sentence except the death penalty is unquestionably foreclosed.
Further, noting that observe that in the instant case, the prosecution had proved the chain of circumstances against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court observed thus:
"It is unimaginable that a cheerful, frolicking child enjoying with her pet would provoke the feelings of lust in a man who is a father of two daughters and a son. The perversity in the mind of the accused is apparent and therefore, we are of the opinion that the aggravating circumstances in the present case outweigh the mitigating circumstances placed before the court in the course of hearing of the appeal."
Importantly, the Court spoke to the accused and noted that he had no remorse for what he did, and therefore, the Court remarked that the appellant had not, for a moment thought of the precious life of the minor child. 
It did not strike him for a moment that he himself happens to be a father of two daughters, who are yet to see the life, the Court said.
Stressing that the crime smacks of degradation of a girl child, depravity and perversity of his mind, and the fact that the child was sexually assaulted in a barbaric and inhuman manner, calling the crime, diabolic in nature, the Court held that it was a brutal murder which made it the rarest of rare case.
Further, noting that the accused in the present case deserves the death penalty, as any alternative punishment would be unquestionably foreclosed taking into consideration the inhuman and barbaric act of the accused, the Court remarked thus:
"It is such an incident that parents of every small girl child would feel a chill down the spine before sending their undefended, innocent, minor girl child to see the rainbow as they would be scared as to whether she would fall prey to any monster like the present one. It is the safety of a girl child which is of paramount importance to society," the Court further observed.
Lastly, the Court directed the District Legal Service Authority to pay 10 lakhs compensation to the victim's father within 30 days, since the mother of the victim had abandoned the child two years prior to the incident and had not even inquired about the death of her girl child.

The Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by UP Judicial Services Association along with some of the judicial officers (having less than 3 years of experience as of December 31, 2021) seeking a direction allowing them to appear for the suitability test 2020 for promotion to UP Higher Judicial Services.
The Bench of Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan and Justice Subhash Vidyarthi observed that the High Court committee's decision to include the names of only those judges who have completed three years in service can't be interfered with by the Court in its Writ jurisdiction.
The case in brief
Essentially, in December 2020, the Allahabad High Court had issued an advertisement inviting applications for filling up 98 (87+11/backlog) vacancies of the Higher Judicial Service for the recruitment year 2020 through direct recruitment from amongst the eligible Advocates under the 25% quota provided in Rule 6 (ii) of the U.P. Higher Judicial Service Rule 1975.
Now, the petitioners moved the Court contending that as the quota of direct recruitment as provided in Rule 6 (ii) of the Rules of 1975 is 25% (total of 87 seats), a total of 348 vacancies would be available in the recruitment year 2020 for U. P. Higher Judicial Services.
Further, it was their contention that a total of 215 posts out of 348 vacancies of Higher Judicial Services, which occurred in the recruitment year 2020, should be filled up by promotion from amongst the Civil Judges (Senior Division).
The U.P. Judicial Services Association further submitted that it had sent a representation to the Registrar (Selection and Appointment) of the High Court that the Judicial Officers in the Civil Judge (Senior Division) Cadre falling in the Zone of consideration (three times of the number of vacancies advertised) who have completed more than two years of service in the Civil Judge (Senior Division) Cadre, be permitted to appear in the suitability test for promotion to the Higher Judicial Service Cadre.
However, it was submitted that on May 30, 2022, a notice was issued by the High Court stating that the suitability test – 2020 for promotion of officers in U.P. Nyayik Seva to U.P. Higher Judicial Services will be held on 11.06.2022. 
Along with it, a list of 150 officers, who have completed three years' service as of 31.12.2021 in the cadre of Civil Judge (Senior Division), including the names of the officers who are working as Additional District Judge (FTC), and are eligible to appear in the suitability test 2020 was also published by the Court.
Against this backdrop, the Petitioners submitted that notifying the names of only 150 eligible officers is not in consonance with the provisions of Rule 20 (2) of the Rules of 1975. It was their case that all of them and other judges of the senior division who have not completed 3 years of service be included in the list of persons eligible for the eligibility test.
As per the petitioners, the fixation of the cut of date as 31.12.2021 and imposition of the condition of having completed three years' service as on 31.12.2021 in the cadre of Civil Judge (Senior Division) for eligibility to appear in the U. P. Higher Judicial Service Suitability Test 2020 violates Rule 5 (a) of the Rules of 1975, as the condition of having completed three years' service in the cadre of Civil Judge (Senior Division) has not been provided as an eligibility condition in the aforesaid Rule.
It was their case that the promotions should be made from amongst the Civil Judges (Senior Division) on the basis of merit – cum – seniority and passing the suitability test under Rule-5 (a) of the Rules of 1975, without any reference to the length of their service.
All in all, as per the petitioners, the eligibility list published on 30.05.2022 should consist of 860 candidates in view of Rule 20 (2) of Rules of 1975 and there should not be any eligibility condition of 3 years in service as of December 31, 2021.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court observed that the scope of interference by the High Court while deciding the petition for issuance of Certiorari is limited to examining the decision-making process by examining as to whether the decision-making process suffers from any illegality or infirmity. 
Further, the Court stressed that the correctness of the decision cannot be examined by the High Court while deciding a petition for issuance of a Writ of Certiorari as the decision can only be examined on the touchstone of reasonableness and arbitrariness but the sufficiency or correctness of the reasons cannot be gone into by the High Court.
Now, regarding the facts of the case, the Court noted that the list of only those Civil Judges (Senior Division) who have completed three years' service has been prepared to treat them as eligible to appear in the Suitability Test 2022 under Rule 22 (3) was prepared in furtherance of decision of the Selection and Appointment Committee.
The Court noted that the committee had formed a reasoned opinion in the exercise of its power under Rule 20 (3) that only those officers are fit to be considered for appointment on the basis of merit-cum-seniority who have completed a minimum period of three years on the post of Civil Judge (Senior Division). 
"This decision has been taken by the Selection and Appointment Committee keeping into consideration that the vacancies had occurring up to 31.12.2021 and it was felt not to be proper to go beyond that date to fix any date to determine the qualifying service in Civil Judge (Senior Division) cadre for consideration of their promotion to Higher Judicial cadre. The Committee was also of the opinion that by inclusion of Civil Judges (Senior Division) who have not completed three years on the said post would result in higher number of the Courts of Civil Judge (Senior Division) falling vacant and this would create a situation where the cadre of Civil Judge (Senior Division) will collapse owing to huge number of vacant Courts. Therefore, the list of officers prepared under Rule 22 (3) of the Rules of 1975 consequent to the aforesaid decision, needs no interference by this Court in exercise of its Writ jurisdiction," the Court remarked as it dismissed the plea.

Case title - Up Judicial Services Association Thru. Its Secy. General Harendra Bahadur Singh And 39 Others v. State Of Up Thru. Its Add. Chief Secy. Deptt. Of Appointment Civil Secrtt. Lko And Another

The Supreme Court of India on Monday sought the stand of the Centre and the National Medical Commission on a plea against a circular retrospectively requiring foreign medical graduates without clinical training to undergo a Compulsory Rotatory Medical Internship (CRMI) for two years instead of one. A division bench comprising Justices B.R. Gavai and Vikram Nath, directed this matter to be heard along with a batch of petitions filed by foreign graduates from China, Ukraine, Philippines, who were unable to complete clinical training because of intervening circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the Russia-Ukraine war, and consequently, wanted to be accommodated within the Indian medical education architecture. The batch of petitions will be heard on Wednesday, January 25.
 The bench headed by Justice Gavai was informed by Advocate Shivam Singh that the scheme framed by the National Medical Commission, pursuant to an April 2022 ruling, allowing foreign graduates who were unable to complete clinical training to secure provisional registration in India after completing an internship of two years, was made to retrospectively cover even such foreign medical students who had already received their provisional or permanent registration certificates. The effect of this circular was that the registration of such doctors, despite them having treated patients for several months, stood cancelled and the certificates already issued by state medical councils were revoked.
 Urging the court to hold in abeyance, the disqualification notice vis-à-vis the petitioners who had already obtained permanent registration certificates, Singh argued, “The petitioners are not shying away from an opportunity to gain more experience. But they are in a situation where the court has directed the centre and the commission to devise a workable solution for the junior batch that has completed three semesters online, whereas the petitioners have had only one remote semester. That too, at a time when the pandemic was waging – between January and May 2020. After that, the petitioners have also qualified the Foreign Medical Graduates Examination and secured their provisional medical registration.”
 The bench expressed its disinclination to grant any interim relief immediately and asked the petitioners to wait till the next hearing. Justice Gavai said, “The petitioners can wait for nine days. If we deem fit, we will set aside the disqualification then.” On behalf of the bench, he pronounced, “Issue notice returnable on January 25. The petitioners have also been granted the liberty to serve the standing counsel for the first respondent and the central agency for the other respondent.”
 The petitioners have contended that the notice issued on July 28, 2022, was, inter alia, contrary to the principles of equity and fair play, and the doctrine of legitimate expectations, besides being violative of the fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19, and 21. The retrospectivity of the circular has also been called in question. The petition was filed through Advocate-on-Record, Gopal Singh. Advocates Shivam Singh and Shaswati Parhi appeared for the petitioners.
 Singh told LiveLaw, “The petition challenges the National Medical Commission’s powers to retrospectively impose conditions and even deregister doctors. In case the impugned circular is allowed to operate, then it introduces uncertainty in the lives of doctors who have already studied for several years. Additionally, it is a classic case of changing the rules of the game after the game has started.”
 In April of last year, a division bench headed by Justice Hemant Gupta had directed the National Medical Commission to frame a scheme to allow students of the batch 2015-20 who were unable to undergo their clinical training to complete it in medical colleges identified by the commission, while hearing an appeal against a Madras High Court direction to allow such a student to be provisionally registered. In December, while hearing similar petitions by foreign medical graduates of the batch 2016-21, the top court left it to the centre and the National Medical Commission to find a solution, but urged them to look at the problem from a humanitarian angle.

 Gurmukh Singh & Ors. v. National Medical Commission & Ors. | Writ Petition (Civil) No. 25/2023

"Whether the age of superannuation should be increased and if so, the date from which this should be effected is a matter of policy into which the High Court ought not to have entered"The Supreme Court has set aside a judgment of the Allahabad High Court which directed that retrospective effect from September 2002 should be given to the decision taken by the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (NOIDA) in September 2012 to enhance the retirement age of its employees from 58 to 60.Allowing an appeal filed by the NOIDA against the judgment, a bench comprising Justices...
The Supreme Court has set aside a judgment of the Allahabad High Court which directed that retrospective effect from September 2002 should be given to the decision taken by the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (NOIDA) in September 2012 to enhance the retirement age of its employees from 58 to 60.
Allowing an appeal filed by the NOIDA against the judgment, a bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah observed that the High Court trenched upon a domain of executive policy regarding retirement age.
The Supreme Court observed in its judgment :
"Whether the age of superannuation should be enhanced is a matter of policy. If a decision has been taken to enhance the age of superannuation, the date with effect from which the enhancement should be made falls within the realm of policy...
The infirmity in the judgment lies in the fact that the High Court has trenched upon the realm of policy making and has assumed to itself, jurisdiction over a matter which lies in the domain of the executive. Whether the age of superannuation should be increased and if so, the date from which this should be effected is a matter of policy into which the High Court ought not to have entered". 
The High Court passed the judgment in a writ petition filed be certain employees of NOIDA who were aggrieved with the fact that only prospective effect was given to the enhancement of retirement age. The High Court took the view that not giving the benefit of increase in the age of superannuation to those employees who had retired before September 30, 2012 was arbitrary.
Disagreeing with this view of the High Court, the Supreme Court observed :
"Whether the decision to increase the age of superannuation should date back to the resolution passed by NOIDA or should be made effective from the date of the approval by the State government was a matter for the State government to decide. Ultimately, in drawing every cut-off, some employees would stand on one side of the line while the others would be positioned otherwise. This element of hardship cannot be a ground for the High Court to hold that the decision was arbitrary. When the State government originally decided to increase the age of superannuation of its own employees from fifty-eight to sixty years on 28 November 2001, it had left the public sector corporations to take a decision based on the financial impact which would result if they were to increase the age of superannuation for their own employees"
'Promissory Estoppel' and 'Doctrine of Legitimate Expectation' not applicable
Some of the respondents placed reliance on the principles of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation on the basis of an earlier representation made by the NOIDA to the Uttar Pradesh Government in 2009 to increase the retirement age.
However, the Supreme Court refused to accept these arguments.
The judgment authored by Justice DY Chandrachud stated :
"Since the enhancement of the age of superannuation is a 'public function' channelised by the provisions of the statute and the service regulations, the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be used to challenge the action of NOIDA.  Though NOIDA sought the approval of the State government for the enhancement with 'immediate effect', it never intended or portrayed to have intended to give retrospective effect to the prospectively applicable Government order. The representation of NOIDA could not have given rise to a legitimate expectation since it was a mere recommendation which was subject to the approval of the State Government. Hence, the doctrine of legitimate expectation also finds no application to the facts of the present case".

The Supreme Court held that Subordinate Legislation in the form of Statutory Rules is a 'law' under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act.
Section 23 of the Contract Act states that the consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless it is forbidden by law.
The court was considering an appeal that arose from a specific performance suit in which the defendant pointed out that Bangalore Rules of Allotment, 1972 Rule 18(2) had an embargo against alienation for a period of ten years and therefore the contract is not lawful. The issue raised was whether the enforcement of an agreement to sell expressly or impliedly, lead to palpably defeat this Rule. 
In this case, the Trial Court while refusing specific performance, directed the return of the amount paid by the plaintiff under the contract. Allowing the appeal, the High Court directed the defendants to execute the sale deed relating to the plaint schedule property in favour of the plaintiffs.
In appeal filed by the defendants, the bench  comprising Justices KM Joseph and PS Narasimha noticed that in Union of India v. Col. L.S.N. Murthy (2012) 1 SCC 718, it was held that "the word "law" in the expression "defeat the provisions of any law" in Section 23 of the Contract Act is limited to the expressed terms of an Act of the legislature".
"With respect, the principle laid down, does not commend itself to us. We do agree that the illegality cannot be a matter of conjecture nor the purpose divined by the Court from parliamentary debates.", the bench said. The court also noticed that in the said case, the Court was dealing with a Notification, which was, in fact, a 'letter' written by the Government of India.
"What is contemplated under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act is law, in all its forms, being immunised from encroachment and infringement by a contract, being enforced. Not only would a Statutory Rule be law within the meaning of Article 13 of the Constitution of India but it would also be law under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act"
The court also noticed that Gherulal Parakh v. Mahadeodas Maiya AIR 1959 SC 781 and 'Pollock and Mullah' Commentary of Indian Contract Act and observed:
"72. In regard to the Commentary by the very same Author, under the Second Head of "illegal object or consideration" in Section 23 of the Contract Act, viz., if the consideration or object is of such a nature that if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law, it is that, this Court took the view that law for the purpose of Section 23 would be, law made by the Legislature. Quite apart from the fact that what is involved in the said case was only a letter, the Judgment of this Court in Gherulal Parakh (supra) and the Commentary from the very same Author, was not noticed by this Court. Therefore, it becomes all the more reason as to why we need not refer the matter to a larger Bench. We may also notice that 'law', for the purposes of Clauses (1) and (2) cannot be different. It is very clear that Regulations or Orders made under the Authority derived from the Legislature referred to by this Court, are species of subordinate 95 legislation. Statutory Rules would also, therefore, clearly be law"
In the instant case, the court found that, the contract was unenforceable for reason that it clearly, both expressly and impliedly, would defeat the object of the Rules, which are statutory in nature.
Observing thus and considering other aspects of the case, the bench allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit for Specific Performance. The court, however,  directed payment of Rs.20,00,000/- by defendants to plaintiffs within a period of three months. "Having regard to the entirety of the evidence and the conduct of the parties, noticing even the admitted stand of the second defendant that the plaint schedule property has a value of Rs.2.5 crores and the plaintiff has paid, in all, a sum of Rs.50,000/, which constituted the consideration for the agreement to sell several years ago, while we dismiss the Suit for Specific Performance, we should direct the appellants to pay a sum of Rs.20,00,000/- in place of the Decree of the Trial Court.", the court said in this regard.

The Chhattisgarh High Court has held that when the Fundamental Rules 
expressly provide for the grant of full pay and allowances on the exoneration of a Government servant from punishment/criminal charges, the principle of 'No Work No Pay' would have no application.
Justice Sanjay K. Agrawal remarked that the principle of 'No Work No Pay' would not override sub-rule (2) of Rule 54 of the Fundamental Rules, which provides for full pay and allowances on full exoneration.
Background:
The petitioner, a Jail Gaurd, was terminated from service by the competent authority. He preferred an appeal before the appellate authority, which was allowed, and he was then reinstated in service. 
However, the full pay and allowances from the date of termination till the date of reinstatement was not granted by the appellate authority.
This part of order, of not granting full pay and allowances, was called in question by the petitioner in the instant writ petition. 
Senior Advocate H.B. Agarwal, appearing for the petitioner, argued that full pay and allowances from the date of termination till the date of reinstatement ought to have been granted to the petitioner in the light of Rule 54 (2) of the Fundamental Rules. 
On the other hand, Additional Advocate General Sunil Otwani, appearing for the respondent-State, submitted that the appellate authority had considered the facts and circumstances of the case and rightly held that the petitioner was not entitled to full pay and allowances on the principle of 'No Work No Pay.
Findings:
The Court noted that Rule 54(2) of the Fundamental Rules entitles the Government servant for full pay and allowances in case of full exoneration.
It was noted that the principle of 'No Work No Pay' was based upon a fundamental concept in a Law of Contact of Employment, where wages and salary were paid by the employer in consideration of work/service rendered by the employee. Thus Court added that,
" 'No Work No Pay' principle has been laid down keeping in view public interest that a Government servant who does not discharge his duty is not allowed pay and arrears at the cost of public exchequer."
Referring to the judgement of the Apex Court in the State of Bihar and Ors. v. Kripa Nand Singh & Anr. where it was observed that 'No Work No Pay' is the rule and 'No Work Yet Pay' is the exception, the Court stated that the exception would apply only when an employee was compelled (compulsory waiting period) not to attend his duty without any violation or any fault on his part.
Further reliance was placed on Commissioner Karnataka Housing Board v. C. Muddaiah, where the Supreme Court reiterated that the principle of 'No Work No Pay' was not absolute in a given case, if the person was willing to work but was illegally and unlawfully not allowed to do so; the Court may, in the circumstances, direct the authority to grant him all benefits considering "as if he had worked".
After examining the precedents, the Court noted that the principle of 'No Work No Pay' would not be applicable where the rule expressly directed so otherwise, like in the case  sub-rule (2) of Rule 54 of the Fundamental Rules in the instant case. 
Accordingly, the part of impugned order of 2010 holding the petitioner to be not entitled for full pay and allowances from the date of termination till the date of reinstatement was set­ aside. The Court thus remitted the matter back to the appellate authority to consider the case of the petitioner for grant of full pay and allowances.
Case Title: Rajendra Sharma & Ors v. State of Chhattisgarh & Ors.
Read Order 

Opining that petitions seeking pre arrest bail are not same as money recovery proceedings petitions, the Supreme Court of India recently annulled a condition imposed by the Jharkhand High Court of depositing 7.5 Lakhs as "victim compensation" while granting pre-arrest bail. A Division Bench of Dinesh Maheshwari and Bela M Trivedi observed,"Even if we take the submissions of the learned counsel for the contesting respondent on its face value, we are clearly of the view that in essence, the petitions seeking relief of pre arrest bail are not money recovery proceedings and, ordinarily, there is no justification for adopting such a course that for the purpose of being given the concession of pre-arrest bail, the person concerned apprehending arrest has to make payment." The Bench was considering an appeal plea filed challenging the order of the Jharkhand High Court granting pre-arrest bail to the appellants on the condition that they furnish a bond of Rs.25,000/- and deposit a demand draft Rs.7,50,000/- as an ad-interim victim compensation.The counsel appearing for the No. 2 has submitted 1 that the expression "victim compensation" as used in the impugned order may not be apt as it was not a case of recovery of victim compensation, But otherwise, the condition cannot be said to be unjustified or onerous because receiving of the said sum of Rs. 7,50,000/- by the appellants at the time of marriage has not been a fact in dispute.The counsel appearing for the state government relied on several orders against imposing the terms of payment for the purpose of granting the relief of pre-arrest bail and remitting the matter for re-consideration. The Court then modified the order of the High Court in the present matter, without remitting the matter back to the High Court. "Having regard to the circumstances, in our view, the said condition of depositing a sum of Rs.7,50,000/- for the purpose of granting the relief of pre-arrest bail cannot be approved and else, the order granting bail deserves to be maintained. Hence, we are of the view that no useful purpose would be served by sending the matter for reconsideration to the High Court and the order impugned deserves to be modified appropriately in these appeals only." The top Court clarified that the order is modified in the manner-releasing the appellants on bail in the event of arrest on furnishing bond of Rs. 25,000/ will remain intact but the other part of the order, requiring the appellants to deposit a sum of Rs. 7,50,000/- has been annulled.With these observations, the Court disposed of the plea. Case Title: Udho Thakur Vs State Of Jharkhand | Criminal Appeal Nos. 
While dismissing a review application filed by the High Court of Madras on its administrative side, the Madras High Court held that the administrative side cannot seek a review of its own judgments on the judicial side as it would amount to undermining the judicial fibre.
 Justice PT Asha noted that while an administrative order of the High Court can be subject to scrutiny, the vice versa was not true. 
 Therefore, the present petition seeking leave to review which does not come within the parameters supra, cannot be entertained as it would amount to undermining the Judicial fibre whose touchstone is its fierce independence and to discharge its duty without any kind of fear or favour.
 The court was faced with this “strange conundrum” when the High Court on its administrative side had sought review of a May 5 order passed by Justice Asha where the court was dealing with the benefit of exemption from payment of court fee. After noting that grant of exemption was the discretion of the Presiding Officer, the court also laid down certain guidelines for granting exemption. These guidelines were being challenged by the administrative side even though it was not a party to those proceedings.
 The court observed that the administrative side had failed to state how it was aggrieved by the guidelines that were issued. 
 I am faced with a rather strange conundrum of the High Court on its Administrative side seeking leave to review an order passed by it on its judicial side, particularly when the High Court is not even a party to the proceedings leave alone an aggrieved party. Is this Court therefore confronting a two faced JANUS?
 Further, the directions, by no stretch of imagination were prejudicial to the interests of the claimants, Court said. Thus, as per the court, the administrative side was only trying to circumscribe the judicial authority of the court exercising jurisdiction under Clause 36 of the Letters Patent 1865. 
 The court also stated that as per Article 215 of the Constitution, the right to correct judgment accrued only when there was an apparent error and even that right was conferred only on the High Court in its judicial side. The court also noted that as per binding precedents, the orders passed by the Judicial side were binding on the administrative side which the administrative side could not ignore these orders. 
 Case Title: The High court of Judicature at Madras v. Thirumalai and others

A committee constituted by the Calcutta High Court on Friday submitted a report on the alleged irregularities in appointments of Group-C posts in the state government-run schools in West Bengal on the purported recommendation by the West Bengal School Service Commission (WBSSC). 
A Division Bench had earlier set up an inquiry committee headed by Justice Ranjit Kumar Bagh, former judge of the Calcutta High Court to probe into the recruitment scam. The other members of the committee includes Asutosh Ghosh, Member of West Bengal School Service Commission, Paromita Roy, Deputy Secretary (Administration), West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and advocate Arunava Banerjee, a practicing lawyer of the High Court.
The Court appointed committee apprised a Bench comprising Justice Ananda Kumar Mukherjee and Justice Subrata Talukdar that 381 appointments for Group-C posts in the state government-run schools in West Bengal were made illegally. 
Furthermore, the committee recommended criminal proceedings against four ex-state SSC officials and the incumbent president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education. It also sought disciplinary proceedings against six other former senior SSC officials. 
Advocate Arunabha Bandopadhyay, a member of the committee submitted the report before the Division Bench and stated that massive irregularities were committed in giving appointments to the 381 candidates after flouting existing rules and procedures. 
The report further averred that a five-member panel constituted in 2019 by the order of the Joint Secretary to the Government of West Bengal, Education Department to oversee the recruitment of close to 13,000 non-teaching staff in government-aided schools did not have any legal validity. The 5 members of the panel were- S. P. Sinha, Advisor to the West Bengal Central School Service Commission - the Convenor, S. Acharya, Personal Secretary to Minister in Charge of the Department, P. K. Bandyopadhyay, OSD to the MIC of Education Department, A. K. Sarkar, Deputy Director (GA Section), Directorate of School Education Department, T. Panja, Senior Law Officer of the department. 
Accordingly, the Court appointed committee recommended penal action to be taken against former SSC Chairman Saumitra Sarkar, former SSC secretary Ashok Saha, and S Acharya, who was the programme officer of SSC, besides SP Sinha and Kalyanmoy Ganguly.
Pursuant to the submissions, the Division Bench observed that it would pass its judgment in the matter on May 18. 
"Mr. Arunava Banerjee, Learned Advocate and Member of the Committee of Enquiry appointed by the Hon'ble Court ( R.K. Bag Committee) for enquiring into the alleged illegal appointments under the School Service Commission pursuant to RLST-2016, submits and places the Report of the Committee connected to appointments in Group-C Posts, in terms of the previous direction of this Court dated 13th April, 2022. The other appearing Learned Senior Counsel and Learned Counsel also place their submissions. Hearing stands accordingly concluded. To appear next for Judgement on the 18th of May, 2022 at the first sitting of the Court", the Court recorded in its order. 
The Court appointed committee had earlier submitted its report in the court on alleged irregularities in the appointments of Group-D staff in State government run schools. Furthermore, the Court had earlier extended a stay for five weeks on an order of Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay that had the then Education Minister Partha Chatterjee to appear before the CBI for interrogation pertaining to the alleged recruitment scam.

While allowing the plea filed by the petitioner, the single bench of Rajasthan High Court, Jodhpur held that the decision of the State seeking to convert the school in question from a Hindi medium to an English Medium school with immediate effect, is fortiori, violative of Article 19(1)(a) and 14 of the Constitution. 
Justice Dinesh Mehta held that English, as a medium of instruction, cannot be thrusted upon a child even by a legislation enacted by the State Government, much less by a policy decision".
The present petition, filed by the School Development Management Committee of Shri Hari Singh Senior Secondary School, Pilwa Panchayat Samiti Dechu, Jodhpur, challenging the decisions of Sept 2021 taken by the state government which converted petitioners' Hindi Medium school to an English Medium School - Mahatma Gandhi Government School (English Medium).
From the factual matrix ,the following 5 questions emerged and the court answered accordingly:
(i) Whether Article 21A of the Constitution of India which guarantees a right to education, also guarantees right to receive education in mother tongue or home language?
Relying on the Supreme Court's case of State of Karnataka & Anr. Vs. Associated Management of English Medium Primary & Secondary Schools & Ors. (2014) 9 SCC 485, the court ruled that since Article 21A of the Constitution is tethered with the words "in such manner, as the State, may, by law determine", therefore, the State may by law provide the medium and manner to provide such free education, which in a given case can be Hindi, English or even regional dialect - the mother tongue of the child. No child or parent can claim it as a matter of right, that he/his ward should be instructed in a particular language or the mother tongue only.
(ii) Whether right to get education in mother tongue or Hindi is a fundamental right?
While examining the above ruling of State of Karnataka, wherein the Supreme Court also held that the right to have education in mother tongue or in a particular medium is guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a), the single bench in this instant case, pointed out that such right has reasonable restriction under Article 19(2) of the Constitution.
The court added that the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) is only subject to reasonable restrictions by law to be enacted by the State and through these, it can prescribe a medium of instruction considering the overall development of the child & socio-economic factors.
The court answered that the State's policy decision cannot whittle down the fundamental right of a child to be taught in a particular medium, which is assured rather protected by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India.
(iii) Whether the policy decision of the State converting the school in question to Mahatma Gandhi English Medium School is in conflict with the provisions of section 20, 21, 22 and 29(2)(f) of the Act of 2009?
The court pursued the Act of 2009 and the Rajasthan Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2011 ("Rules"), which authorised the School Management Committee to perform various functions including the preparation of school development plan, enrollment, attendance etc. However, the Court was unable to conclude that prescription of medium of instruction is a decision to be taken by the School Management Committee, as a part of school development plan. The court observed that preparing a school development plan cannot be misconstrued to mean the prescription of syllabus and medium of instructions. It has to be done by the experts in the field of education/child education.
(iv) Whether the consent of School Development Management Committee (SDMC) is necessary before converting a Hindi medium school to an English medium school?
The court opined that on the conjoint reading of section 21 and 22 of the Act of 2009 and Rule 3 and 22 of the Rules of 2011, it can be observed that it is not within the domain of the SDMC to decide as to what language pupil of the school will be instructed. The medium of instruction is to be determined by the Appropriate Authority or Rajasthan School Education Council, added the court.
Rule 3(2) of 2011 thereof provides that parent/guardian of every child studying in the School will be a member of the SDMC. However, In this case, the impugned administrative decision of abruptly converting a Hindi medium school to an English medium was upheld, without the wishes and consent of the SDMC.
The court remarked that changing the medium of instruction of a school which houses 601 rural students, out of which 303 are girls and a major part of them hail from lower strata, including SC, ST, OBC and minorities cannot be countenanced. The same is violative of their constitutional rights and is likely to affect their emotional quotient as well.
The court ruled, "Merely because the State has taken a stand that in view of the demand of more English medium schools, one English medium school in all villages having the population of more than 5000 should be established, the opinion of the SDMC cannot be given a go bye – altogether. The argument that there is no requirement of consent of the SDMC, for the school in question, as it is founded; funded; maintained and controlled by the State, cannot be accepted."
The court, while quashing the state's decision, remarked, "The defence, which the State has taken that the children of this school will be accommodated in nearby schools, cannot be accepted as a valid justification for uprooting 601 saplings (students) from the present school to be implanted in nearby schools, even if they are within the vicinity of 2 kms. Such action in no case can be taken in the middle of academic session 2011-22."
(v) Who can decide or change the medium of instruction in elementary level schools?
As per court, Section 29 of the RTE Act specifically provides that curriculum and evaluation procedure shall be laid down by the Academic Authority. Rule 22 of Rules, 2011, which have been framed in exercise of powers available to the State under section 38 of the RTE Act is the relevant provision, which provides for and speaks of an Academic Authority. The court opined that since the medium of instruction is to be determined by the Academic Authority, which in the State of Rajasthan is Rajasthan School Education Council, the School Management Committee, cannot decide the medium of instruction may it be Hindi or English.
The court observed, "Section 29(2)(f) of the Act of 2009 and the National Education Policy, 2020 prescribes that the medium of education or instruction till elementary level shall be in mother tongue. This Court has no hesitation in holding that the same cannot be changed to English medium at least by an administrative decision. It further added, "The conversion of the school in question to English medium is, therefore, clearly contrary to the provisions of section 21, 22, 29(1) and 29(2)(f) of the RTE Act."
In addition to this, the Single Bench relied on the case of Dr. Srinivas Guntupalli Vs. The State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors.; Writ Petition (PIL) No.183/2019. wherein Andhra Government had issued notification which provided that all Government schools from Grade - I to VIII for the academic session 2020-21 and Grade – IX & X for the academic session 2021-2022 be converted to English medium schools. When said decision came to judicial scrutiny, the Andhra Pradesh High Court quashed the Government notification holding, inter-alia, that the same is violative of Article 21A and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India, apart from being in contravention of provisions of section 29(2) of the Right to Education Act, 2009 and section 7(3) and 7(4) of the Act of Andhra Pradesh Right to Education Act, 1982.
The petitioner pointed out that the school comprises various children below 14 years. He argued that consequent to the impugned decision of the State, the students of the school are compelled to take admission in other schools that too in the midst of their academic session. Such action/order of the State Government is violative of the rights of the petitioners and students/parents guaranteed under Article 21A of the Constitution.
The petitioner further submitted that if the State really wants to bring in more English medium schools or Mahatma Gandhi Schools, it is incumbent upon it to create infrastructure and provide for budget as had been done in the operational guidelines of 2014-15, in which a decision to establish Swami Vivekanand Government Model School was taken by the State Government, however by setting apart separate budget for the same.
On the other hand, the respondents argued that the right of primary education has been guaranteed by Article 21A of the Constitution of India, but the same is not an absolute right. Imparting education in English can by no stretch of imagination be said to be violation of right guaranteed under Article 21A of the Constitution of India.
Case Title: School Development Management Committee, Shri Hari Singh Senior Secondary School and Ors  v. State Of Rajasthan and Anr

The Delhi High Court has reiterated that in a suit for possession simplicitor or a suit for injunction against dispossession simplicitor, the plaintiff is not required to establish title or ownership.
 Single bench of Justice C. Hari Shankar observed that the plaintiff is only required to establish a better right to remain in possession of the suit property as compared to the right of the defendant.
 "A suit which does not claim titular rights and merely claims a right to continue in possession without possession being disturbed save and except in accordance with law, is not required to make out a case of title. The law respects possessory rights over immoveable property, even in the absence of valid title."
 It added, "A person in settled possession of immoveable property is entitled under Section 9 of the Specific Relief Act, to continue in such possession, without being dispossessed save and except in accordance with law."
 The Court was dealing with a second appeal under Section 100 of the CPC, preferred against decree of permanent injunction restraining the appellants from trespassing in the suit property or from forcibly dispossessing the respondent therefrom without following due process of law.
 The appellants were defendants in the original suit preferred by the Respondent herein, claiming to be in peaceful possession of the suit property. It was alleged that appellants broke the locks on the suit property and effected forcible ingress.
 The Respondent also placed on record electricity bills with respect to the suit property, which were in his name.
 Thus, the Court held that the Respondent had tendered sufficient evidence to establish possession and that in a suit claiming possession simplicitor, the question of title is not relevant.
 Significantly, the Appellants sought to aver that the suit property was their ancestral property and that the title documents, on which the respondent placed reliance, were forged and fabricated. 
 However, the Court noted that barring bald assertions in the written statement, no evidence had been led by the petitioners to make out the case propounded above. Not a single document was filed in support of the assertions, and no oral evidence was led before the Courts below.
 "They (appellants) appear to have been harbouring a misconception, throughout, that mere allegations in a written statement were sufficient to dispute the case set up by the respondent, and that no responsibility, thereafter, lay on the petitioners (appellants) to support the allegations with evidence," Court remarked.
 Even the cross examination of the respondent by the Appellants did not elicit any material on the basis of which the title documents of the respondent, or the possession of the respondent over the suit property could be regarded as having been rendered vulnerable.
 The appellants also sought to contend that no title could pass to the Respondent under a GPA, Will, agreement to sell and receipt.
 The Court however relied on Suraj Lamp & Industries v. State of Haryana to uphold that, even if title could not pass under Agreement to Sell, GPA and Will, the said documents, if executed validly/properly, did convey certain rights over the property in question, under Section 53A4 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1883.
 Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.
 Case Title: Saleem & Ors. v. Wahid Malik

Granting permission to Ramdaspeth Plot Owners and Residents Association to organize its Navratri festival including dandiya and garba performances in a silence zone, the The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court recently said the religious celebration can still be performed in a purely traditional and religious way.
"Dandiya and Garba performances being intrinsic part of a religious celebration can still be performed in purely traditional and religious way, which do not contemplate use of modern gadgets like, music system, loudspeakers, DJ sound and the like", the court said.
 A division bench of Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Govind Sanap passed the order in a writ petition objecting to the organization of Navratra Festival wherein the petitioners are apprehending playing of loud music on DJ causing loud noise harmful to humans.
 The court said that in Navratri celebrations presiding deity may have different names but these are outward manifestations of the fundamental energy called 'Shakti'. A form of 'Shakti' is worshipped in Navratri, it said.
 The court noted that worship to goddess of Shakti is effective only when it is done with one pointed attention without any external disturbances. No offering of one pointed worship and devotion is possible unless there is full concentration of mind, said the court.
 "…every offering of worship and devotion to the presiding deity of Navratra festival must be done with great care and a devotee must ensure that by his or her actions, the discipline and sanctity of the festival are not sacrificed", it added.
A true devotee would like to express his devotion and offer his worship to the deity without receiving any disturbance of any kind from the outside world and he himself would not cause any disturbance to others in his worship, said the bench
 The basic issue involved in the petition was prohibition on use of music or sound system during celebration of religious festivals in a silence zone.
 The Association is organizing Navratra festival, which includes dandiya and garba performances in a playground of Mor Hindi Upper Primary School. The school shares a common compound wall with a hospital.
 The court said that the venue is a silent zone and therefore all restrictions in Rule 3(5) Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 would apply to the facts of this case. 
"That means, no Dandiya and Garba performances can be permitted without imposing the prohibitions contained in said Rule," said the court
 The court noted that a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed and executed between the petitioners and the organisers of the festival in 2019 limiting the use of loudspeakers, sound systems etc. during the Navratri festival. Both parties should honour this MoU, said the court.
 Court said that this MoU does not mean that there can be no celebration altogether and granted permission to the organizers to engage in Dandiya and Garba performances in a traditional and purely religious way without using any loud sound system or D.J. system etc.
"In addition, such celebration would also have to be consistent with provisions made in Rule 3(5) of the Rules of 2000, it being done in a silence zone," said the court.

The Supreme Court observed that merely because a long period has lapsed by the time the appeal is decided cannot be a ground to award the punishment which is disproportionate and inadequate.
The bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna observed that it has come across a number of judgments of different High Courts in which the criminal appeals are disposed of in a cursory manner and by adopting truncated methods.
We deprecate such practice of disposing of criminal appeals by adopting shortcuts, the court said.
In this case, Rajasthan High court partly allowed a criminal appeal by maintaining the conviction of the accused for the offence under Section 307 IPC, but by reducing the sentence from three years rigorous imprisonment to the period already undergone by him in confinement (44 days). To reduce the sentence the High Court considered the submissions on behalf of the accused Banwari Lal that the occurrence took place about 26 years ago and that the accused were facing trial since last 26 years and that when the occurrence took place in the year 1989, the accused were young and now they are aged persons. The State assailed this judgment before the Apex Court.
The bench observed that the High Court has dealt with the appeal in a most casual and cavalier manner. The judgment and order passed by the High Court reducing the sentence is nothing but an instance of travesty of justice and against all the principles of law laid down by this Court in a catena of decisions on imposing appropriate punishment/suitable punishment, the court said.
The court noted that, in the present case, the accused could have been sentenced to undergo life imprisonment and/or at least up to ten years.
Answering the contention that there is no minimum sentence under Section 307 IPC, the bench observed that discretion has to be exercised judiciously and the sentence has to be imposed proportionately and looking to the nature and gravity of the offence committed and by considering the principles for imposing sentence. While allowing the appeal, the bench observed:
"Merely because a long period has lapsed by the time the appeal is decided cannot be a ground to award the punishment which is disproportionate and inadequate. The High Court has not at all adverted to the relevant factors which were required to be while imposing appropriate/suitable punishment/sentence. As observed hereinabove, the High Court has dealt with and disposed of the appeal in a most cavalier manner. The High Court has disposed of the appeal by adopting shortcuts. The manner in which the High Court has dealt with and disposed of the appeal is highly deprecated. We have come across a number of judgments of different High Courts and it is found that in many cases the criminal appeals are disposed of in a cursory manner and by adopting truncated methods. In some cases, the convictions under Section 302 IPC are converted to Section 304 Part I or Section 304 Part II IPC without assigning any adequate reasons and solely recording submissions on behalf of the accused that their conviction may be altered to Section 304 Part I or 304 Part II IPC. ..In cases, like the present one, the accused did not press any challenge to the conviction and prayed for reduction in sentence and the same is considered and an inadequate and inappropriate sentence has been imposed without assigning any further reasons and without adverting to the relevant factors which are required to be considered while imposing appropriate punishment/sentence. We deprecate such practice of 15 disposing of criminal appeals by adopting shortcuts. Therefore, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court reducing the sentence to the period already undergone (44 days) from three years rigorous imprisonment imposed by the learned trial Court in respect of accused Banwari Lal is absolutely unsustainable and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside."

The Allahabad High Court last week observed that a Criminal Appeal cannot be dismissed on the ground of not being pressed. 
The Bench of Justice Anil Kumar Ojha observed thus while allowing a revision plea filed against an order passed by Additional Sessions Judge under Section 101 of JJ Act dismissing an appeal filed by the accused/revisionist on the ground of not pressed.
The case in brief 
Essentially, the Accused/Revisionists were convicted by the Juvenile Justice Board, District Sambhal under Sections 376, 506 I.P.C. in December 2020. Challenging the said order and judgment, they had moved an appeal before the Court of passed by Additional Sessions Judge (Rape Cases & POCSO Act) Sambhal at Chandausi.
However, the appellate court dismissed their appeal in November 2021 as not pressed and affirmed the order and judgment of the Juvenile Justice Board, District Sambhal convicting them under Sections 376, 506 I.P.C.
Thereafter, the Revisionists moved the High Court with their instant revision plea. 
Before the High Court, their counsel argued that the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge (Rape Cases & POCSO Act) Sambhal at Chandausi was illegal as the appeal had been dismissed on the ground of not pressed by the counsel for the Revisionists.
Court's observations
Referring to the apex court's ruling in the cases of State of Haryana v. Janak Singh, (2013) 9 SCC 431 and Gurjant Singh vs State of Punjab LL 2021 SC 650, the High Court came to the conclusion that a Criminal Appeal cannot be dismissed on the ground of not pressed.
Thus, the Court found that the impugned order of the Additional Sessions Judge (Rape Cases & POCSO Act) Sambhal at Chandausi deserved to be set aside and Revision deserved to be allowed. 
Accordingly, Revision was allowed and the impugned order was set-aside. The matter was remitted to Additional Sessions Judge (Rape Cases & POCSO Act) Sambhal at Chandausi to dispose of the matter in accordance with provisions of law after providing an adequate opportunity of hearing to the parties. 
It was also directed that Additional Sessions Judge (Rape Cases & POCSO Act) Sambhal at Chandausi shall dispose of the appeal within a period of three months noting that the revisionists are already in jail and matter relates to Section 376 I.P.C.
Advocates Mohammad Khalid and Pawan Kumar Yadav appeared for the petitioners.

In a pertinent judgment, Madras High Court has observed that extramarital affairs can cause grave mental trauma and mental health issues leading to serious consequences in the matrimony, and that in turn, would amount to mental cruelty under Section 498(A) IPC.

In a pertinent judgment, Madras High Court has observed that extramarital affairs can cause grave mental trauma and mental health issues leading to serious consequences in the matrimony, and that in turn, would amount to mental cruelty under Section 498(A) IPC. 
Justice D. Bharatha Chakravarty however added that when deciding whether a conduct amounted to cruelty, the Court has to look at the facts and circumstances of the case.
The observation was made while confirming the conviction of a husband accused of engaging in an extramarital relationship with another woman while the marriage with the respondent wife was still valid.
In its order, the Bench noted that the evidence on record proves the existence of an extramarital relationship that has gone to the roots of the marriage and severely affected the mental health of the wife. This ultimately resulted in the wife leaving the matrimonial home.
Relying on the dictum in K.V. Prakash Babu v. State of Karnataka, the court noted as below:
"This Court has to read the evidence of PW.1, PW.7 & PW.8 as a whole and a proper reading would convey the essence that cruelty, predominantly mental cruelty, was unleashed on PW.1 (Wife), on account of the extramarital affairs developed by the petitioner herein...But the perusal of the above dictum (K.V Prakash Babu's case) would itself make it clear that the Court has to take into consideration the said abnormal behaviour with the facts and circumstances of the case and it has to be decided whether the conduct amounted to cruelty. Therefore, looking at the evidence of PW.1, PW.7 & PW.8, which is on record, it is clear that there was extramarital relationship. It has caused such an effect on the mental health of PW.1, which resulted in serious domestic discord and her leaving the matrimonial home. As a matter of fact, as per the evidence on record, PW.1 went out of the matrimonial home on 16.11.2005"
'Cruelty', as given in Section 498(A) IPC would mean either of the following:
(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or
(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.
In K.V Prakash's case, the apex court had held that mental cruelty cannot be given a generalised meaning and can only be ascertained based on the facts and circumstances of each case. The court had also mentioned that one out of the two opposing outcomes are probable while answering if an extramarital affair can amount to mental cruelty.
"Extra marital relationship, per se, or as such would not come within the ambit of Section 498(A) of IPC. It would constitute a criminal offence. There is no denial of the fact that the cruelty need not be physical but a mental torture or abnormal behaviour that amounts to cruelty or harassment in a given case. It will depend upon the facts of the said case", the court had noted in this judgment. 
The court had further stated that the concept of mental cruelty also depends on the individualistic perception regard being had to one's sensitivity and endurance as well as the social strata from which each individual comes. 
The court further noted in K.V Prakash Babu that the husband being in an extramarital relationship and the wife having some suspicion about it won't normally constitute mental cruelty when read in tandem with the offence of abetment to suicide under Section 306 IPC.
Coming back to the case before Madras High Court, the bench also perused the birth certificate of the child born to the husband in the extramarital relationship.
"During the course of the hearing of the learned Government Advocate (crl.side) appearing for the first respondent, also produced the Birth certificate, evidencing the birth of a child for the petitioner/accused and the said A6, which was born on 17.09.2006 itself. Therefore, the Court cannot close its eyes to the hard evidence and the facts of this case"
The court concluded that there was no illegality committed by the trial court or the lower appellate court while convicting the accused of mental cruelty. However, the court deemed it fit to modify the sentence so as to reduce the term of imprisonment from one year to six months.
The counsel for the petitioner/ accused had previously argued that Trial Court and the lower Appellate Court erred by considering the evidence in a perverse manner, warranting the High Court's interference by exercising its revisional jurisdiction. The counsel made special reference to the lower appellate court judgment that confirmed the conviction of the trial court in one sentence as a glaring example of such illegality. The counsel for the victim and the government argued that the court's revisional powers only permit limited judicial review and the conviction by the lower courts should not be interfered with by initiating a full reappreciation of evidence.
Before the trial court, the respondent wife had accused the husband, his family members and the woman alleged to have been involved in the extra marital relationship of offences under 406, 494 and 506(ii) IPC along with 498(A ) IPC.  Though the wife argued that the husband contracted a second marriage and neglected the her which constitutes the offence of bigamy, it was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, the trial court convicted petitioner husband alone for the offence of mental cruelty under Section 498(A) and acquitted all others in toto with regards to all other offences.
Additionally, the counsel for the respondent wife had pointed out three angles to prove that mental cruelty was committed against her by the husband. Firstly, she submitted that she was subjected to physical and mental torture during 2000-2005 in demand of more dowry. However, the court noted that the wife herself has specifically averred that the petitioner/ accused and the respondent wife was living happily during the said period.
"Ex-D1 (legal notice), is caused by the PW-1 and therefore, once she admits in the cross-examination that the notice is given on her instructions and the same being marked, it throws doubt on the allegations leveled", the court noted about the same.
The second angle relied upon by the respondent wife was a specific incident that occured in 2012, which was later admitted by her as not happened in her cross-examination.
It was on the submission about the husband's extra marital relationship that the court was convinced about the mental cruelty meted out to her so as to meet the requirements of Section 498(A) IPC.
While upholding the conviction, the court also refused to consider the petitioner's baseless allegations levelled against the wife about her having an extra marital affair with another man.
Considering all the factors cumulatively, I hold that the action of the petitioner/accused in having extramarital relationship, which has further caused grave mental trauma and affected the mental health of PW.1, leading to serious circumstances, in conjunction with the act of PW.1 being forced to leave the matrimonial home, would amount to cruelty to her within Section 498(A) of IPC", the court iterated again while partially allowing the criminal revision petition.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently allowed the appeal by the husband against the order of the Trial Court wherein his petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (HMA) for dissolution of marriage was dismissed.
The bench comprising Justice Meenakshi I Mehta held that the respondent-wife has subjected the petitioner to cruelty hence, it would be impossible for the petitioner to live with her anymore.
 The court further observed that facts and circumstances unequivocally suggest that the wife has incessantly been filing the complaints against the petitioner and his family members that led to petitioner's arrest and he had to go behind the bars. This all has resulted in harm/damage to his image and reputation in the eyes of their relatives and the society at large.
 The above-discussed facts and circumstances unequivocally speak volumes of the fact that the respondent has incessantly been filing the complaints against the petitioner as well as his family members and the petitioner even had to go behind the bars in connection with one of those complaints, resulting in harm/damage to his image and reputation in the eyes of their relatives and the society at large.
 The petitioner alleged that the respondent-wife used to quarrel over petty matters, frequently threatened to commit suicide, and even threatened to involve him in some false complaint/case. He claimed that she lodged a complaint with the Crime Against Women Cell against him, his mother and sister as well as his uncle but later-on, she made a statement before the police authorities to the effect that she did not want to pursue her complaint further.
Subsequently, it is alleged that the respondent again submitted a complaint against him and his family members there also and in pursuance of the same, the police arrested him by invoking the provisions of Sections 107/151 CrPC. However, the respondent did not make any statement before the said Authority and finally, he was discharged in the said proceedings. Even thereafter, it is alleged that the respondent kept on moving false complaints against him and his family members at Crime Against Women Cell.
Court placed reliance on Apex Court's judgement in Joydeep Majumdar v. Bharti Jaiswal Majumdar 2021 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 289 and held that the respondent has subjected the petitioner to cruelty after their marriage.
 The present case is squarely covered by the above-discussed observations and in the light of the same, it is held that the respondent has subjected the petitioner to cruelty after their marriage. 
 Even otherwise, the court noted that the parties are living separately for the last 7 years and therefore, their marriage can be termed as a "dead marriage".
As a sequel to the foregoing discussion, the court allowed the present appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and decree passed by the trial Court.
 Furthermore, the court allowed the petition filed by the petitioner-husband under Section 13 of the Act and dissolved the marriage between the parties under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.
 Case Title: Anmol Verma v. Radhika Sareen
Case No: FAO No.6969 of 2019 (O&M)

The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently upheld the award passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, whereby the Insurance Company was directed to pay compensation to the legal representatives of the deceased, despite the insurance policy being bought after the death of the policy owner.
 Deciding the appeal preferred by the Insurance Company against the impugned award, Justice Vishal Dhagat held that the Company did not exercise ordinary care and diligence in the case-
 Since, owner-Urmila Uikey has died, therefore, she could not have appeared for signing application and proposal for purchase of policy. Insurance Company made no efforts to find out why Insured has not appeared and signed the application. Insurer could have discovered the truth by ordinary diligence following proper procedure for issuing of policy.
 The facts of the case were that the policy owner/deceased had met with a fatal accident while travelling in a car registered under her name. The said car was insured by the Appellant Company in the favour of the deceased. The Insurance company was challenging the award passed by the Claims Tribunal in favour of the legal representatives of the policy owner/deceased.
 The Appellant company submitted that the policy owner had died more than two and a half years before the policy was bought. It was argued that since there cannot be any contract between a dead and living person, the said insurance policy was null and void and Claims Tribunal had committed an error in fixing liability on them to indemnify the owner and pay the legal representatives of deceased. 
 Examining the submissions of the parties and documents on record, the Court noted that despite the misrepresentation on the part of the legal representatives in contracting with the Appellant, the contract was not voidable-
 In this case as owner has died before purchasing insurance policy, therefore, there was a misrepresentation on the part of legal representatives/driver/owner of vehicle in contracting with the appellant for purchase of policy in name of deceased owner Urmila Uikey. Contract entered between the parties is not voidable as consent given by appellant for covering the risk on purchase of policy was given by misrepresentation or silence hiding the fact that Urmila Uikey has died as appellant had means to discover the truth with ordinary diligence.
 The Court further observed that the Appellant Company received the money and issued the policy without carrying out due diligence. The Court also pointed out that even during the pendency of the case, no effort was made for declaring policy to be void or to cancel the same. Therefore, the Court concluded, the policy could not be held to be voidable at option of the Appellant Company. Finding no in the impugned award, the Court dismissed the appeal. 
 Case Title : NATIONAL INSURANCE CO. LTD v SMT. GUDDI BAI AND ANRS.

Directing the Passport Officer to consider former J&K Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti's mother's application for re-issuance of passport afresh, the Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Saturday said that the authority has not to act as "mouthpiece of the CID". It ruled that the police verification report cannot override the statutory provisions of Section 6 of the Passport Act, 1967.
Setting aside the orders by which Mufti's mother Gulshan Nazir was refused passport, Justice M A Chowdhary said the passport officer shall consider the entire matter afresh and pass orders thereon within a period of six weeks.
The court said though the right to travel abroad can be curtailed by the Passport Officer on the basis of the available material but the authority in all situations has to take the decision strictly in accordance with the provisions of Passport Act 1967.
"There appears no ground to refuse issue or renewal of Passport requested by the petitioner. Even, there is not an iota of allegation against the petitioner which may point out to any security concerns. The police verification report formulated by CID CIK cannot override the statutory provisions of Section 6 of the Passport Act 1967," said the court.
Senior Advocate Jehangir Iqbal Ganai for the petitioner earlier argued that there were no allegations against the petitioner in the CID report and the Passport Officer had not applied his mind while rejecting her request for issuance of Passport.
He further submitted that the petitioner is a senior citizen of more than 80 years of age and asked what security threat the country could have in issuing passport in her favour for traveling abroad, adding that she is not a member of any banned organization and has a right to travel anywhere in the world being the peace loving citizen of India.
Per contra, Deputy Solicitor General of India T. M. Shamsi countered that the Passport Officer has to rely on the police verification report while issuing passport in favour of any person. CID recommendation is essential for issuance of Passport or otherwise and when there is a negative report from the CID against any person, the Passport authority cannot issue a Passport in favour of that person, he submitted. 
Justice Chowdhary noted that the police verification report was formulated in reference to two cases as both the applications moved by Nazir and her daughter Mufti were dealt with together and in respect of both the applications, Police Verification Report (PVR) remarks were recorded as: ‘Passport service not recommended and connected security clearance withheld’. 
However, the court observed that the police verification report had been formulated indicating the security angles for passport clearance of the former Chief Minister while with regard to the her mother, there was not "even an iota of allegation" which could indicate the security concerns of the State.
"The only aspect with regard to the petitioner is the reference of investigation by two agencies; Enforcement Directorate and CID CIK with regard to some of the transactions regarding some bank accounts maintained by the petitioner either separately or jointly with Ms. Mehbooba Mufti," said the court.
The court added that as far as the PMLA is concerned, 'no objection' has to be sought from the trial court. "However, there is nothing on record to say that charge-sheet has been laid against the petitioner or not," it said.
Deliberating on Sub Section(2) of Section 6 of the Passport Act, the bench explained that the provision clearly prescribes that an application for grant of renewal of passport shall be refused only on the grounds mentioned in the Section or if departure of the applicant from India may, or is likely to, be detrimental to the security of India. 
Observing that nothing adverse has been recorded against the petitioner, with regard to any security concerns, the court said the only aspect with regard to her is the reference of investigation by two agencies - Enforcement Directorate and CID CIK, with regard to some of the transactions regarding some bank accounts maintained by the petitioner either separately or jointly with Mufti. 
The bench observed that simply because the report of the J&K CID did not recommend issuance of passport, the Passport Officer has not to shut his eyes and to act on that. It added that the decision of both the Passport Officer as well as the appellate authority is misplaced on account of security. 
"Atleast Passport Officer should have, in the background of the facts and circumstances, if required, asked the police and CID agency as to whether there is anything adverse against the petitioner. In such a situation without going into the PVR, refusal on part of the Passport Officer simply be termed as non-application of mind," Justice Chowdhary observed.
Observing that the passport Officer acted blindly on the PVR without analysing the same, the court observed that the report has exhaustively dealt with regard to the petitioner’s daughter making references to her ideology and activities, however, there is no mention with regard to the petitioner in the report in question. 
"The appellate authority also seems not to have perused the Police Verification Report and upheld the order of the Passport Officer, on the wrong premise of security without any foundation," the court added.
In view of the aforesaid discussion, the bench concluded that the ground on which the request of the petitioner for re-issue of the passport has been rejected is totally untenable and unsustainable in the eyes of law.
"The petitioner, who claims to be an octogenarian, in absence of any adverse security report, cannot be deprived of her fundamental right guaranteed to her under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, to travel abroad as an India citizen," ruled the court.

The Allahabad High Court has held that a victim of a predicate offence can claim a right of hearing to oppose the bail application of a person accused under the UP Gangsters Act. 
Taking note of the rulings of the apex court in the cases of Sudha Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. LL 2021 SC 229 and Jagjeet Singh And Ors. v. Ashish Mishra @ Monu And Anr.  (SC) 376, the Bench of Justice Subhash Vidyarthi observed thus:
"If a victim of a predicate offence can file appeal challenging an order granting bail in an offence under the Gangsters Act, he certainly has the right to have an opportunity to oppose the application for grant of bail in an offence under the Act and for that purpose, he will have to be treated as a victim of the offence under the Gangsters Act. Where the victim of a predicate offence has come forward to participate in the proceeding by making submissions in opposition of a bail application, he must be given an opportunity of hearing."
With this, the Single judge disagreed with the decision of a co-ordinate bench in the case of Zeba Rizwan versus the State of U.P., 2022 SCC OnLine All 352 wherein it was held that the victim of a predicate offence cannot be treated to be a victim of an offence under the Gangsters Act and doing so will open a pandora's box and it will create hurdles in the disposal of cases.
The case in brief
The Court was dealing with the bail plea filed by one Ramesh Rai @ Matru Rai seeking bail in a case under the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986 on the basis of the registration of 4 cases against him. 
One of these cases was Case Crime No. 74 of 2022 under Sections 448, 386, 504, 506, 420, 120-B, 34 IPC and Sections 10 (i), 10 (ii), 22 and 23 of the Uttar Pradesh Regulation of Money-Lending Act, 1976. During the course of the hearing of the bail plea, the 'informant' as well as the 'victim' of this very case appeared and sought to oppose the bail application.
At the outset, the State argued that an informant does not fall within the definition of a victim of a case and, therefore, an informant has no right to oppose the prayer for the grant of bail to the applicant in the present case. 
It was further argued that Section 19 (4) of the UP Gangster Act provides that the public prosecutor can oppose the application for the release of a person on bail, but there is no provision giving a such right to any person other than the Public Prosecutor.
However, the Court, taking note of the aforementioned decisions of the Supreme Court, the Court concluded that since the informant claims to be a victim of the predicate offence, he has to be treated as a victim of the present offence and he has the right to make submissions in opposition of the bail application.
In view of this, the objection raised on behalf of the bail applicant was rejected and the Court went ahead to decide the application on its merits after taking into consideration the submissions made by the Counsel for the informant in opposition of the bail application.
Further, the Court noted that the applicant had been implicated in the Gangster case solely on the basis of the perusal of records available with the police, and that too, during patrolling in a jeep, and therefore, the Court came to a prima facie conclusion that the applicant had been implicated by the police without any material against him to establish that he is a gangster.
"The applicant has already been granted bail in all the cases mentioned in the Gang-chart and in four other cases in which he is involved, he stands acquitted in four cases, the police has filed final reports in two cases and a complaint filed against him stands rejected and there is no material indicate that the larger interest of the public or the State would be affected in case the applicant is enlarged on bail," the Court remarked as it allowed the bail plea.
Case title - Ramesh Rai @ Matru Rai vs. State of U.P.

The Kerala High Court recently held that a joint owner of a locker is entitled, as of right, to operate the locker, independent of the other owner, and thus, would not have to secure any letters of administration or probate under Section 29 of the Administrators-General Act, 1963, pursuant to the death of the other owner. 
Perusing Section 218 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, that stipulates as 'to whom administration may be granted, where the deceased is a Hindu, Muhammadan, Budhist, Sikh, Jain or exempted person’, the Single Judge Bench of Justice Shaji P. Chaly observed:
"In my considered opinion, Section 218 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 stipulates the manner in which administration of estate is to be granted by a court of law, in cases where a person has died intestate. This is a case where the first petitioner, who is the joint owner of a locker hired from the Bank, was prevented by the Bank from operating the locker. To put it otherwise, in my considered view, Section 218 of the Act, 1925 has no application, since the petitioner is the joint owner, who is entitled, as of right, to operate the same, even according to the Bank, independent of the other joint hirer of the locker. There is also no requirement to secure any letters of administration under Section 29 of the Administrators-General Act, 1963. There is also no case for the respondent Bank that there is any litigation instituted by anyone in the matter of assets left by the deceased Sasidharan Pillai". 
The first petitioner and her husband had hired a locker jointly in the SBI, where they had kept their valuables. The petitioners averred that they had intimated the death of the 1st petitioner's husband to the Bank on time, and that they were the sole legal heirs of the deceased. However, when the first petitioner had approached the bank following the death of her husband, requesting permission to operate the locker, the same was denied. The petitioner was later intimated vide a letter dated January 4, 2023, by the Branch Manager of the Bank, that she had to secure necessary proof of legal representation in the form of Probate or Letters of Administration in order to operate the same. 
It is the case of the first petitioner that since joint hirers were permitted to operate the locker independently during the lifetime of her husband, and there had not been any contract executed by and between the parties that the locker could only be operated jointly, the stance adopted by the Bank was illegal and arbitrary.
It was pointed out by Advocate Praveen K. Joy on behalf of the petitioners that in Shobha Gopalakrishnan v. State of Kerala (2019), the Kerala High Court had previously permitted one of the joint hirers of a locker to operate the same, on production of a death certificate. He thus contended that the stand adopted by the respondent Bank was against the settled principles of law and the policies and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India. 
On the other hand, the respondents represented by Advocate Jawahar Jose and the Standing Counsel for SBI Advocate Jithesh Menon, argued that the Bank was right in insisting for Probate or letter of administration from the petitioner, by relying on the Circular and revised guidelines that had been issued by the bank. 
The Court in this case, taking note of the factual circumstances, observed,
"In my considered opinion, when the first petitioner and her husband were joint hirers of a locker and they were permitted to operate the locker independently during the lifetime of the husband; the first petitioner is entitled, as of right, to operate the locker, after the death of her husband. It is equally important to note that the first petitioner as well as her husband were permitted to operate the joint locker independent of each other during the lifetime of Sasidharan Pillai, and the same legal position continued after the death of Sasidharan Pillai". 
The Court went on to peruse the Circular dated August 18, 2021, issued by the RBI that deals with locker allotment; infrastructure and securities standards; locker operations; nomination facility and settlement of claims, and ascertained that it only provides for 'nomination facility'. It further noted that the provisions in the Circular only provided for a situation where the locker is permitted to be operated by a nominee after the death of the hirers.
The Court thus rejected the argument of the Standing Counsel that a joint locker hirer also had to follow the procedure enshrined in the Circular. 
The Court thereafter perused the guidelines issued by the SBI, where it had been stipulated in clause 10.2. (a) that in case where deceased locker hirer had not made any nomination or where the joint hirers had not given any mandate that the access may be given to one or more of the survivors by a clear survivorship clause, the procedures prescribed thereunder may be adopted. The Court noted that sub-clause (b) goes on to clarify that the said situation also deals with a case where there is no nomination by the sole locker hirer; which specifies that in case of death of a sole locker hirer (where there is no nomination) and there is a valid will, probate may be obtained, and access may be given to the executor/administrator; in other cases, access may be given to the legal representative of the deceased; and in such cases, death certificate and proof of the legal representation should be obtained and the legal representation would be in the form of probate or Letters of Administration. 
"In my considered view, none of the circumstances contained under Exhibit R2(a) circular and Exhibit R2(b) guidelines issued by the State Bank of India would come into play insofar as a joint locker hirer is concerned even after the death of one of the hirers," the Court ascertained. 
The Court further took note of the Madras High Court Division Bench ruling in Hepzibah Annathai Rengachari v. R. Ananthalakshmi Rangachari (1975), in which it had been laid down that monies in bank either or survivor or joint accounts, letters of administration is not necessary for claiming the same. 
Considering the above, the Court held that a joint locker hirer would not be liable to secure a letter of administration or succession in order to operate the locker in the event of the death of one of the hirers.
"Upshot of the above discussion is that the petitioner is entitled to succeed. The writ petition is allowed and consequently it is declared that the first petitioner is entitled, as of right, to operate the locker in question. Accordingly, there will be a direction to the respondent Nos. 2 [the Bank] and 3 [Branch Manager] to permit the first petitioner to operate locker No.26 held by the first petitioner with the State Bank of India, Chadayamangalam Branch, Kollam District," the Court said while allowing the writ.

The Supreme Court observed that abhorrent nature of crime alone cannot be the decisive factor for awarding death sentence.
Due consideration should also be given to the equally relevant aspect pertaining to mitigating factors before arriving at a conclusion that option of any other punishment than the capital one was foreclosed, the court said while commuting the death sentence awarded to a man accused of rape and murder of a seven year old girl.
The bench comprising Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar noted that the accused has no criminal antecedents, comes from a very poor socio-economic background, has a family comprising of wife, children and aged father, and has unblemished jail conduct. 
"When all these factors are added together and it is also visualised that there is nothing on record to rule out the probability of reformation and rehabilitation, in our view, it would be unsafe to treat this case as falling in 'rarest of rare' category.", the court said.
Pappu was sentenced to death after the Trial Court found him guilty of enticing a seven-year-old girl to accompany him on the pretext of picking lychee fruits; having thereafter committed rape upon the child; having caused her death; and having dumped the dead body near a bridge on the riverbank, after having dragged the dead body over a distance of one and one-quarter kilometres. The Allahabad High Court dismissed his appeal and confirmed the death sentence.
In appeal, the bench took note of the evidence on record and concluded that the accused have been rightly found guilty under Sections 376, 302, 201 IPC and Section 5/6 POCSO Act.
"In an overall view of the matter, it is proved beyond doubt in this case that the hapless child, seven-year-old daughter of the complainant, met with her gruesome end after having been treated inhumanely and having been subjected to sexual assaults; that the victim was lastly seen in the company of the appellant when he enticed and took her along to pluck and eat lychee fruits while shooing away the other children playing with her; that the dead body of the victim child was recovered at the instance of the appellant; and that the appellant failed to satisfactorily explain his whereabouts and his knowledge of the location of dead body. The medical and other scientific evidence has been consistent with the prosecution case and then, the defence version of enmity due to land dispute turns out to be false. That being the position, we have no hesitation in holding that the present case of circumstantial evidence answers the panchsheel principles of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda (supra). The appellant was rightly convicted by the Trial Court and his conviction has rightly been maintained by the High Court. This part of the submissions on behalf of the appellant stand rejected.", the court said.
The court thereafter considered the issue whether death sentence be maintained or substituted by any other sentence. In its judgment, the bench has summarised the evolution of legal position and norms for dealing with the question of sentencing in such matters and the connotations of 'special reasons' for awarding death sentence. The court observed thus:
"It could readily be seen that while this Court has found it justified to have capital punishment on the statute to serve as deterrent as also in due response to the society's call for appropriate punishment in appropriate cases but at the same time, the principles of penology have evolved to balance the other obligations of the society, i.e., of preserving the human life, be it of accused, unless termination thereof is inevitable and is to serve the other societal causes and collective conscience of society. This has led to the evolution of 'rarest of rare test' and then, its appropriate operation with reference to 'crime test' and 'criminal test'. The delicate balance expected of the judicial process has also led to another mid-way approach, in curtailing the rights of remission or premature release while awarding imprisonment for life, particularly when dealing with crimes of heinous nature like the present one"
The court noted that both the Trial Court as also the High Court have taken the abhorrent nature of crime alone to be the decisive factor for awarding death sentence in the present case. In this regard, the court observed:
"The approach of the Trial Court had been that the accused-appellant was about 33-34 years of age at the time of occurrence and was supposed to be sensible. The Trial Court would observe that 'if such heinous crime is committed by him, it is not justifiable to show any sort of mercy in the punishment.' The High Court though has made rather intense comments on the menace of rape and brutal murder of children as also on the society's abhorrence of such crime12 but has, thereafter, proceeded to confirm the death sentence with a cursory observation that there were no substantial mitigating factors and the aggravating circumstances were aplenty. .
..In other words, the impugned orders awarding and confirming death sentence could only be said to be of assumptive conclusions, where it has been assumed that death sentence has to be awarded because of the ghastly crime and its abhorrent nature. The tests and the norms laid down in the relevant decisions commencing from those in Bachan Singh (supra) seem not to have acquired the requisite attention of the Trial Court and the High Court. It would have been immensely useful and pertinent if the High Court, while taking up the question of confirmation of death sentence and making several comments in regard to the abhorrent nature of crime and its repulsive impact on society, would have also given due consideration to the equally relevant aspect pertaining to mitigating factors before arriving at a conclusion that option of any other punishment than the capital one was foreclosed. The approach of the Trial Court and the High Court in this matter while awarding sentence could only be disapproved; and we do so in no uncertain terms."
The bench therefore commuted the death sentence into that of imprisonment for life, with the stipulation that the accused shall not be entitled to premature release or remission before undergoing actual imprisonment for a period of 30 (thirty) years.

The Delhi High Court has dismissed the application of Alexandra Elbakyan, founder of shadow library website Sci Hub, seeking rejection of plaint filed by publishing houses Elsevier, Wiley and American Chemical Society in a copyright infringement suit against her.
The suit has been filed by major publishing houses Elsevier, Wiley India, Wiley Periodicals and American Chemical Society against online repositories Sci-Hub and Libgen. The publishers have said the websites indulge in online piracy by making their literary work available to the public for free.
Justice Sanjeev Narula dismissed the application as not maintainable and noted that Elbakyan has categorically admitted copyright ownership of publishing houses in her written statement. 
It also noted that Elbakyan’s application seeking withdrawal of her admission was rejected by court on November 03, 2022. 
“The effect of rejection necessarily means that admissions on record continue to bind Ms. Elbakyan,” it said. 
The publishers had asserted their copyright ownership on the basis of assignment agreements to prove copyright infringement by the online repositories.
It was Elbakyan’s case that the assignment agreements relied upon by publishers do not confer to them the copyright ownership on the impugned works. Reliance was placed upon sections 16 and 19 of the Copyright Act, 1957 to submit that the agreements relating to copyrights must specify royalty or some other form of consideration, failing which, they cannot affect the assignment of copyright. 
It was submitted that the publishing houses were required to pay royalty and other consideration to the authors in exchange for “exclusive right to publish and distribute the articles”, in absence of which the agreements in question stand invalid. 
Rejecting the application, the court noted that 15 assignment agreements were submitted by the publishers which “serve as an exemplar of the substantial number of agreements” executed between them and the authors. It said that the agreements vested exclusive rights with them over literary works. 
“The legality, veracity and relevancy of such agreements cannot be undertaken at this stage. The Plaintiffs have thus discharged the initial burden under Section 55(2) of the Copyright Act to claim ownership towards the work, which are the subject matter of the present suit. The relevant facts to claim ownership have been clearly disclosed,” the court said. 
On Elbakyan’s submission that the assignment agreements were not relevant to publishers’ case against her, the court said that it must be noted that the case of the publishers against her is for making available infringing copies of their literary works and that the publishers have clearly alleged that she is also responsible for uploading infringing works on the online repository website. 
“As per Plaintiffs, there is a close link between Ms. Elbakyan and Defendant No. 2 and Ms. Elbakyan has uploaded infringing content/ work on Defendant No. 2’s website. Therefore, in view of the above discussion, in the opinion of the Court, the application is not maintainable and the same is accordingly, dismissed,” the court said. 
Both Sci-Hub and Libgen, which claim to host nearly millions of research pieces, have been sued for allegedly providing free access to paywalled research material of various publishers.
While Elsevier publishes journals like "The Lancet" and "Cell" among 2500 others, Wiley publishes nearly 1700 journals. The American Chemical Society, on the other hand, is one of the world's largest scientific societies and publishes the prestigious "Journal of the American Chemical Society."

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently clarified that a government Hospital can't deny treatment to someone on the ground that he/she is not a resident of the area where the hospital is located.
The Bench of Justice Rajbir Sehrawat observed this in a matter wherein a pregnant woman was denied medical treatment by a Government Hospital in Chandigarh on the ground that she is a resident of Punjab and not a resident of the UT Chandigarh.
Essentially, the petitioner (who is 5 months pregnant) had approached a Government Hospital in Chandigarh. and she was registered as a patient at the hospital for treatment as well. However, subsequently, she was turned out from the hospital refusing her treatment on the ground that she was not a resident of UT Chandigarh.
Therefore, she moved the High Court with the instant writ petition seeking issuance of a writ in the nature of mandamus, directing the respondents to provide medical treatment.
During the course of the hearing, even the counsel for the respondents-UT Chandigarh could not point out any law, which entitles a Government hospital to drive out the patients by denying them medical treatment only because of the fact that they do not reside within the area where the hospital is situated. 
In view of this, the Court observed thus:
"Otherwise, also, the petitioner cannot be subjected to discrimination only on the ground of her place of residence. That, in fact, is a direct violation of the fundamental right of the petitioner. Denying her treatment on the above-said ground also violates her right to life and liberty without there being any justifiable reason. This decision or even tendency of Government medical facility cannot be countenanced; by any means."
Agaisnt this backdrop, the Court the petition was disposed of with a direction to respondents to provide necessary medical treatment/advice to the petitioner, in normal course, as and when she approaches the respondent-hospital. 
The counsel for the UT Chandigarh was further requested to take the petitioner to the hospital and to ensure that the necessary treatment of the petitioner is started with immediate effect.

The Karnataka High Court recently quashed the communication issued by Enforcement Directorate (ED) in 2018 to banks, directing them to freeze accounts of NGO M/s Amnesty International (India) Private Limited, alleging violation of provisions of Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, (FEMA). 
A single judge bench of Justice K S Hemalekha said in view of Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, ED's notice was valid only for 60 days. "The impugned notices dated 25/10/2018 at Annexures-F1 and F2 have lost their efficacy by efflux of time as the period of sixty days has expired," it said.
Amnesty claimed that ED conducted search and seizure at its premises on October 25, 2018, without any prior notice. During the said search, several documents pertaining to its financial records and various agreements were scrutinised and cell phones were confiscated from its employees.
Thereafter, the agency issued a direction to its banks- HDFC and Kotak Mahindra- to stop the operation of its accounts, again without any notice.
Senior Advocate Professor Raviverma Kumar appearing for Amnesty had referred to Section 37 of the FEMA Act and Section 132(3) read with 132(8A) of the Income Tax Act to contend that ED's freezing notice could not be in force for a period exceeding sixty days.
Reliance was placed on coordinate Bench judgment of the court in Greenpeace India Society vs Union of India and Others, which was confirmed by a Division Bench.
Senior Central Government Standing Counsel, H. Jayakara Shetty, submitted that the Greenpeace judgment would be applicable only to the present petition and it cannot be a precedent to be applied in all the matters.
Following which the bench said “In light of order in Greenpeace India Society stated supra, confirmed in the Writ Appeal No.1090/2019 the questions involved therein is no more res integra.” 
It held,
“On perusal of the provisions of Section 132(8A) of the Act, it is evident that order under Sub-Section (3) of Section 132 of the Income Tax Act would not be in force beyond sixty days from the date of the order. In light of the provisions of Section 132 (8A), the impugned notices dated 25/10/2018 at Annexures-F1 and F2 have lost their efficacy by efflux of time as the period of sixty days has expired.” 
Accordingly it allowed the petition and quashed ED notices. It added, “All the contentions are left open to be urged before the appropriate authority in accordance with law.”
ED had in 2020 issued provisional attachment orders under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against the bank accounts held by the NGO. 
A single bench of the High Court, on December 16, 2020, had given partial relief to Amnesty India by allowing them to withdraw Rupees 60 lakhs to meet the expenses. Aggrieved by the refusal of the single bench to go into the substantive points of challenge raised against the provisional attachment order, Amnesty had approached the division bench. 
However, on April 8, 2021, the division bench disposed of the appeal observing that the grounds of challenge against the provisional attachment order are to be raised before the PMLA Adjudicating Authority.
Following which the NGO had approached the Supreme Court which vide its order dated 19-10-2022, refused any relief to them, but reserved the right of Amnesty to challenge the provisional attachment order. 
Amnesty India had stopped its operations in India following the attachment of its bank accounts.
Case Title: M/S AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED And UNION OF INDIA
Case NO: WP 56621/2018
Date of Order: 24-02-2023
Appearance: Senior Advocate Professor Ravivarma Kumar for Advocate Jagadeesha B N for petitioner. 
Senior CGS H. Jayakara Shetty for R2. 

The Supreme Court observed that a party who was not 'supplier' on the date of entering into contract cannot seek any benefit as the 'supplier' under the MSMED Act, 2006
If any registration is obtained subsequently the same would have an effect prospectively and would apply to the supply of goods and rendering services subsequent to the registration, the bench of CJI UU Lalit and Justice Bela M. Trivedi observed.
The bench was considering a batch of appeals which raised issues regarding interplay between the MSMED Act and Arbitration and Conciliation Act? The report about the said aspect can be read here.
As per Section 2(n) of the MSMED Act, "supplier" means a micro or small enterprise, which has filed a memorandum with the authority referred to in subsection (1) of section 8, and includes, — (i) the National Small Industries Corporation, being a company, registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956); (ii) the Small Industries Development Corporation of a State or a Union territory, by whatever name called, being a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956); (iii) any company, co-operative society, trust or a body, by whatever name called, registered or constituted under any law for the time being in force and engaged in selling goods produced by micro or small enterprises and rendering services which are provided by such enterprise.
One of the contentions raised in this case was if the party Supplier was not the "supplier" within the meaning of Section 2(n) of the MSMED Act, 2006 on the date of the contract entered into between the parties, it could not have made reference of dispute to Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council under Section 18(1) of the MSMED Act, 2006. In such cases, it was contended that the Council would not have the jurisdiction to decide the disputes as an arbitraton.
The bench, while addressing this contention, referred to Silpi Industries etc. vs. Kerala State Road Transport Corporation and Anr 2021 SCC Online SC 439 and observed:
"It is held that a party who was not the "supplier" as per Section 2 (n) of the MSMED Act, 2006 on the date of entering into the contract, could not seek any benefit as a supplier under the MSMED Act, 2006. A party cannot become a micro or small enterprise or a supplier to claim the benefit under the MSMED Act, 2006 by submitting a memorandum to obtain registration subsequent to entering into the contract and supply of goods or rendering services. If any registration, is obtained subsequently, the same would have the effect prospectively and would apply for the supply of goods and rendering services subsequent to the registration. The same cannot operate retrospectively."
The bench clarified that, since this is a jurisdictional issue, it could also be decided by the Facilitation Council/Institute/Centre acting as an arbitral tribunal under the MSMED Act, 2006 if raised by a party.

The Calcutta High Court has recently refused to grant custody of a four and a half years old girl child to her biological father and instead permitted the child to be in the care and protection of a family friend of her deceased mother.

The Calcutta High Court has recently refused to grant custody of a four and a half years old girl child to her biological father and instead permitted the child to be in the care and protection of a family friend of her deceased mother. However, the Court has granted visitation rights to the biological father after observing that the bond between the child and her natural father ought to be encouraged from a tender age. A Bench comprising Justices Bivas Pattanayak and Joymalya Bagchi acknowledged that while the minor is well adjusted with the family friend, it is important to encourage the bonding of the minor with her biological father. "It must also be borne in mind that a bond between the child and her natural father ought to be encouraged from tender age. Such bonding is not an assertion of right of the father but a step towards wholesome development of a minor vis-a-vis her natural parents", the Court observed. Background 
In the instant case, the mother of the minor had committed suicide on March 7, 2018, and thereafter the biological father of the minor had been arrested in connection with the criminal case registered over the suicide. Subsequently, the father had moved an application seeking custody of the minor who at that point of time had been in the custody of her maternal grandmother, Kajal Saha. The trial court upon consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, directed that the minor should continue to remain in the custody of her maternal grandmother until she attains 15 years of age and is in a position to make a conscious decision regarding her own custody. This order was subsequently appealed by the biological father vide the instant plea. During the pendency of the appeal, the maternal grandmother also committed suicide. Under such circumstances, the minor was put in the care and custody of Julie Roy, a neighbor and a distant relation of the mother of the child. Arguments 
During the proceedings, it had been deposed on behalf of the family friend Julie Roy that in the absence of any responsible member in the immediate family, the minor had been put in her custody. Furthermore, it had been further averred that Julie Roy has had a deep connection with the minor since her birth and that the child is comfortable in her care and custody. The Court was further informed that Julie Roy had also filed an application for guardianship of the minor before the District Judge, Howrah. On the other hand, it was contended on behalf of the appellant/father that the custody of the child must be handed over to him since he is the biological father and is thus best suited to take care of the child under the present circumstances. Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court decision in Tejaswini Gaud and Ors v. Shekhar Jagdish Prasad Tewari. Observations 
The Court noted at the outset that the neighbor Julie Roy had a day-to-day association with the growth and development of the child and thus it can be inferred that the child is accustomed to her company. While the Court acknowledged that an immediate transfer of the custody of the minor to her father may be traumatic for the child, it was important to let the minor bond with her father for the sake of her overall development. Accordingly, the Court directed, 
"In order to enable such a situation and ensure a balance development of the minor, we direct that the minor be handed over to the appellant at 9.00 a.m. on two consecutive Saturdays, i.e. 20th November, 2021 and 27th November, 2021 respectively from the residence of Julie Roy and the appellant shall hand back the minor to the said Julie Roy at her residence at 9.00 p.m. on those dates. The handing over and taking back of the child as aforesaid, shall be in the presence of the learned advocates-on-record of the appellant as well as the intervenor Julie Roy. It is expected that the parties shall act in terms of this order and the best interest of the child." Furthermore, the Court vide order dated November 29, 2021 also directed a Child Welfare Officer to interact with the child exclusively in the absence of any of the parties. The Child Welfare Officer was further ordered to submit a report in this regard in a sealed envelope on the next date of hearing. "This order shall immediately be communicated by the Secretary, Juvenile Justice Committee to the Child Welfare Officer of the District concerned for immediate implementation. 
The Allahabad High Court on Thursday granted bail to a man booked under the Uttar Pradesh Prevention Of Cow Slaughter Act, 1955 on the condition that he shall serve the cows for a period of one month in Gaushala after his release from the jail.
The bench of Justice Shekhar Yadav issued this order while granting bail to one Saleem Alias Kaliya, who was booked under Sections 3/8 of the Cow Slaughter Act, 1955. 
Before the Court, the accused argued that he was not named in the first information report and during the investigation, the complicity of the applicant had been shown in the present case on the basis of his confessional statement. 
It was further argued that after his arrest, two cases had been slapped upon him, even though nothing had been recovered from his possession and there is no independent eye witness of the recovery. 
His counsel contended that the recovery that has been shown is false and fabricated. He made several other submissions in order to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations made against him. It was lastly submitted that the accused is in jail since August 2021.
Against this backdrop, after perusing the records of the case in the light of the submissions made at the bar and after taking an overall view of all the facts and circumstances of the case, the nature of evidence, the period of detention already undergone, the unlikelihood of early conclusion of the trial and also the absence of any convincing material to indicate the possibility of tampering with the evidence, the Court concluded that the applicant may be enlarged on bail.
However, he was granted bail on the following two conditions:
"The applicant shall deposit Rs.1 lakh in favor of anyone Registered Gaushal of District Bareilly within a month after release. Immediately after release from jail, the applicant shall himself available at Gaushalal and seve the cows for a period of one month."
It may be noted that in September 2021, the Bench of Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav had observed that the Cow should be given the status of National Animal in light of the fact that "Cow is part and parcel of the culture of India" and that eating/consuming Cow-beef can't be considered to be a fundamental right of any person.
In the order passed by Justice Yadav, it was also observed that scientists believed that the cow is the only animal that inhales and exhales oxygen.
"Panchgavya, which is made of cow milk, curd, ghee, urine and cow dung, helps in treatment of several incurable diseases", the judge had said in the order. He had also observed that it is a tradition in India to use ghee made of cow milk during yajna because "this gives special energy to sunrays, which ultimately causes rains".
The Court had observed thus as it denied bail to one Javed who has been accused of slaughtering a cow after committing its theft, and booked under S. 379 IPC r/w S. 3, 5, 8 UP Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, 1955.
Cow Should Be Declared National Animal; Cow Protection Be Made Fundamental Right Of Hindus : Allahabad High Court
Significantly, the Bench of Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav, in its bail order written in Hindi, had further observed that Fundamental Rights are not only the prerogative of beef eaters, rather, those who worship the cow and are financially dependent on cows, also have the Fundamental Right to lead a meaningful life.
Case title - Saleem Alias Kaliya Vs. State of U.P. [CRIMINAL MISC. BAIL APPLICATION No. - 48222 of 2021]

The Karnataka High Court has said that the power under Sections 133, 138 and 139 of CrPC to prevent public nuisance has to be exercised by affording sufficient opportunities to the parties and to record evidence and to arrive at a legal finding that the action of the person has resulted in nuisance to the general public at large.
 A single judge bench of Justice V. Srishananda made the observation while allowing the petition filed by Achut D. Nayak and others challenging the order passed by the Sub-Divisional  Magistrate, directing closure of the poultry farm on grounds of causing public nuisance. The order was confirmed by the Additional District and Sessions Judge. 
Background
The petitioners argued that the the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, without recording the evidence, passed an order on December 19, 2016 to the effect that the preliminary order passed in the case is made absolute. It was submitted that when Section 133 of CrPC is invoked, judicial discretion is mandatory. However, the Magistrate failed to record evidence and also failed to look into the root of the case, as whether the alleged complaint comes under Section 133 to 138 of CrPC or not and hence the order is against the principles of law.
 Further it was said that Section 133 CrPC provide a speedy and summary remedy in case of an urgent situation where there is imminent danger to public interest or public health. In all other cases, the parties should be referred to the remedy under the ordinary law of land. But in this case, without any valid reasons and without verifying the alleged reports as to whether the authorities had complied with the procedure laid down by the respective laws before preparing such reports, the Respondent proceeded under Section 133 CrPC.
 It was pointed out that the Petitioners have been running their poultry farm over their own lands since 2000 and admittedly, there are nearly 24 to 25 poultry-farms within the jurisdiction. However, it was alleged that some inimical persons misused Section 133 CrPC with false allegations that entire activities of Petitioners are illegal and which effects the health of the neighbouring residents.
 It was lastly submitted that the Respondents and the Sessions Court failed to understand that no licence is required to run a poultry farm under any law. The provisions of Section 2 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961 clearly state that poultry-farming is part of agriculture.
 Findings:
 The bench noted it is an admitted fact that the poultry farm is established in a private land belonging to the petitioners. As could be seen from the record of rights, the land in which the poultry farm is situated belongs to the petitioners and it is an agricultural land. The term 'agriculture' in its wide connotation encompasses itself into it the activities allied to the agricultural operations. It cannot be disputed that poultry farming is part of the agricultural operations.
 The bench also observed that the material on record shows that the poultry farm is situated about 3 kms away from the place where the residences of the general public are situated. It said ,"What exactly is the type of nuisance that has been caused to the general public at large by establishing such a poultry farm in the private land owned by the petitioners is not forthcoming on record. No material is forthcoming on record placed by the respondents, wherein the general public complained about the nuisance." 
 The bench then relied on the coordinate bench judgment in the case of Balakrishna Rao Vs. State of Mysore and Others reported in 1973 (1) Mysore Law Journal page 362, wherein it was held that the evidence has to be recorded by the Magistrate. It further observed that, though the spot inspection was conducted in the said case, the evidence was not taken by the Magistrate and therefore, the decision taken by the Magistrate did not satisfy the requisite conditions to pass the order under the provisions of Section 137 Cr.P.C. 
 Following which it said, "In the case on hand also, the Executive Magistrate failed to record evidence and satisfy about the alleged nuisance. Under such circumstances, the action taken by the authorities without even recording the evidence of the parties, has resulted in miscarriage of justice and also abuse of process of law." 
 Accordingly, it allowed the petition and set aside the order of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate.

The Supreme Court held that a person who is ineligible under Section 29A of the Insolvency Bankruptcy Code to submit a resolution plan, cannot propose a scheme of compromise and arrangement under Section 230 of the Companies Act, 2013.
The bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah also upheld the constitutional validity of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016, which stipulate that a person who is not eligible under the IBC to submit a resolution plan for insolvency resolution of the corporate debtor shall not be a party in any manner to such compromise or arrangement.
The Court observed thus while dismissing the appeals against National Company Law Appellate Tribunal and also a writ petition challenging constitutional validity of Regulation 2B Of Liquidation Process Regulations. NCLT, in these cases, held that a person who is ineligible under Section 29A of the Insolvency Bankruptcy Code to submit a resolution plan, is also barred from proposing a scheme of compromise and arrangement under Section 230 of the Companies Act, 2013.
"It would lead to a manifest absurdity if the very persons who are ineligible for submitting a resolution plan, participating in the sale of assets of the company in liquidation or participating in the sale of the corporate debtor as a 'going concern', are somehow permitted to propose a compromise or arrangement under Section 230 of the Act of 2013.", the Apex Court bench observed.
Referring to various precedents and provisions of both IBC and Companies Act 2013, the court observed thus in para 68 of the judgment:
The statutory scheme underlying the IBC and the legislative history of its linkage with Section 230 of the Act of 2013, in the context of a company which is in liquidation, has important consequences for the outcome of the controversy in the present case. The first point is that a liquidation under Chapter III of the IBC follows upon the entire gamut of proceedings contemplated under that statute. The second point to be noted is that one of the modes of revival in the course of the liquidation process is envisaged in the enabling provisions of Section 230 of the Act of 2013, to which recourse can be taken by the liquidator appointed under Section 34 of the IBC. The third point is that the statutorily contemplated activities of the liquidator do not cease while inviting a scheme of compromise or arrangement under Section 230. The appointment of the liquidator in an IBC liquidation is provided in Section 34 and their duties are specified in Section 35. In taking recourse to the provisions of Section 230 of the Act of 2013, the liquidator appointed under the IBC is , above all, to attempt a revival of the corporate debtor so as to save it from the prospect of a corporate death. The consequence of the approval of the scheme of revival or compromise, and its sanction thereafter by the Tribunal under Sub-section (6), is that the scheme attains a binding character upon stakeholders including the liquidator who has been appointed under the IBC. In this backdrop, it is difficult to accept the submission of Mr Bajaj that Section 230 of the Act of 2013 is a standalone provision which has no connect with the provisions of the IBC. Undoubtedly, Section 230 of the Act of 2013 is wider in its ambit in the sense that it is not confined only to a company in liquidation or to corporate debtor which is being wound up under Chapter III of the IBC. Obviously, therefore, the rigors of the IBC will not apply to proceedings under Section 230 of the Act of 2013 where the scheme of compromise or arrangement proposed is in relation to an entity which is not the subject of a proceeding under the IBC. But, when, as in the present case, the process of invoking the provisions of Section 230 of the Act of 2013 traces its origin or, as it may be described, the trigger to the liquidation proceedings which have been initiated under the IBC, it becomes necessary to read both sets of provisions in harmony. A harmonious construction between the two statutes would ensure that while on the one hand a scheme of compromise or arrangement under Section 230 is being pursued, this takes place in a manner which is consistent with the underlying principles of the IBC because the scheme is proposed in respect of an entity which is undergoing liquidation under Chapter III of the IBC. As such, the company has to be protected from its management and a corporate death. It would lead to a manifest absurdity if the very persons who are ineligible for submitting a resolution plan, participating in the sale of assets of the company in liquidation or participating in the sale of the corporate debtor as a 'going concern', are somehow permitted to propose a compromise or arrangement under Section 230 of the Act of 2013.
The court, also rejected the contention that attaching the ineligibilities under Section 29A and Section 35(1)(f) of the IBC to a scheme of compromise and arrangement under Section 230 of the Act of 2013 would be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution as the appellant would be "deemed ineligible" to submit a proposal under Section 230 of the Act of 2013.
"We find no merit in this contention. As explained above, the stages of submitting a resolution plan, selling assets of a company in liquidation and selling the company as a going concern during liquidation, all indicate that the promoter or those in the management of the company must not be allowed a back-door entry in the company and are hence, ineligible to participate during these stages. Proposing a scheme of compromise or arrangement under Section 230 of the Act of 2013, while the company is undergoing liquidation under the provisions of the IBC lies in a similar continuum. Thus, the prohibitions that apply in the former situations must naturally also attach to the latter to ensure that like situations are treated equally.", the court said.
The court also rejected the contention that Section 35(1)(f) applies only to a liquidator who conducts a sale of the property of the corporate debtor in liquidation but not to the NLCT, acting as the Tribunal, when it exercises its powers under Section 230 of the Companies Act 2013. It observed thus:
"The liquidator appointed under the provisions of Chapter III of the IBC is entrusted with several powers and duties. Sections 37 to 42 of the IBC are illustrative of the powers of the liquidator in the course of the liquidation. The liquidator exercises several functions which are of a quasi-judicial in nature and character. Section 35(1) itself enunciates that the powers and duties which are entrusted to the liquidator are "subject to the directions of the adjudicating authority". The liquidator, in other words, exercises functions which have been made amenable to the jurisdiction of the NCLT, acting as the Adjudicating Authority. To hold therefore that the ineligibility prescribed under the provisions of Section 35(1)(f) can be disregarded by the Tribunal for the purpose of considering an application for a scheme of compromise or arrangement under Section 230 of the Act of 2013, in respect of a company which is under liquidation under the IBC, would not be a correct construction of the provisions of law."
The main ground of challenge to Regulation 2B was that the regulation transgressed the authority of IBBI by introducing a disqualification or ineligibility in regard to the presentation of an application for a scheme of compromise or arrangement under Section 230 of the Companies Act. Addressing this argument, the court observed thus:
"The position in our view can be considered from two perspectives, independent of the provisions of Regulation 2B. We have indicated in the discussion earlier that even in the absence of the Regulation 2B, a person ineligible under Section 29A read with Section 35(1)(f) is not permitted to propose a scheme for revival under Section 230, in the case of a company which is undergoing a liquidation under the IBC. We have come to the conclusion, as noted for the reasons indicated earlier, that in the case of a company which is undergoing liquidation pursuant to the provisions of Chapter III of the IBC, a scheme of compromise or arrangement proposed under Section 230 is a facet of the liquidation process. The object of the scheme of compromise or arrangement is to revive the company. The principle was enunciated in the decision in Meghal Homes (supra) while construing the provisions of erstwhile Section 391. The same rationale which permeates the resolution process under Chapter II (by virtue of the provisions of Section 29A) permeates the liquidation process under Chapter III (by virtue of the provisions of Section 35(1)(f)). That being the position, there can be no manner of doubt that the proviso to Regulation 2B is clarificatory in nature. Even absent the proviso, a person who is ineligible under Section 29A would not be permitted to propose a compromise or arrangement under Section 230 of the Act of 2013. We therefore do not find any merit in the challenge to the validity of Regulation 2B."
 Dismissing the appeals, the bench concluded thus:
Based on the above analysis, we find that the prohibition placed by the Parliament in Section 29A and Section 35(1)(f) of the IBC must also attach itself to a scheme of compromise or arrangement under Section 230 of the Act of 2013, when the company is undergoing liquidation under the auspices of the IBC. As such, Regulation 2B of the Liquidation Process Regulations, specifically the proviso to Regulation 2B(1), is also constitutionally valid. 
Read Judgment

The Delhi High Court has directed the civil courts to incorporate the endorsement that “defendant should file his written statement of defence within 30 days from the date of service/receipt of summons” while issuing summons to the defendant in a commercial suit.
 “The Registrar of this Court is directed to transmit copies of this order to the learned District & Sessions Judge (HQ) as well as District & Sessions Judge of all other districts in order to pass necessary orders to make the endorsement as stipulated in Para 35 of this judgment a mandatory part of the summons to be  issued under Order V Rule 5 CPC, 1908 in cases pertaining to Commercial Suits as a necessary requirement," Justice Tushar Rao Gedela said.
 The court said the service of summons is a very important procedural and there cannot be any laxity insofar as commercial suits are concerned.
 Observing that the 30-days period for filing a written statement would commence on and from the date of service of summons, the bench, however, said that failure of the trial court to issue summons to defendant under Rule 5 of Order V of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC), cannot be detrimental to the rights provided to the defendant.
 The high court passed these directions while dealing with a petition filed by Machine Tools Aids India, which was a defendant in the recovery suit instituted before the trial court. It challenged the trial court’s order where its application under Order VIII Rule 1 had been dismissed, foreclosing its right to file the written statement; while allowing the application under Order VIII Rule 10 filed by the M/s GNC Infra LLP.
 Justice Gedela observed that the trial court had never passed orders issuing summons to Machine Tools Aids. In the absence of issuance of valid summons, it cannot be assumed that Machine Tools Aids India had the knowledge of the obligation to file the written statement within a period of 30 days from the date of the service of summons, the bench said.
 Machine Tools Aids argued before the high court that the trial court had neither issued any notice to it nor ordered filing of any process. It added that service of summons is a sacrosanct procedure and that the failure of such service cannot be detrimental to the defendant.
 The petitioner submitted that despite repeated requests, the complete copy of the plaint along with the annexures were never furnished to it or its counsel. Thus, the petitioner was constrained to inspect the judicial file, where it was revealed that order of issuance of process had not been issued by the trial court. 
 Machine Tools Aids also argued that after the trial court in its Order dated 20.09.2022, had given it 5 days’ time to file the written statement and a reply to the application under Order VIII Rule 10 CPC filed by M/s GNC Infra LLP, the same were filed by it on 24.09.2022. Thus, the written statement was filed within the limitation period, it contended.
 GNC Infra argued that on many dates the counsel for Machine Tools Aids appeared but he still did not choose to file any written statement. Thus, it contended that it moved an application under Order VIII Rule 10 r/w with Section 151 CPC seeking foreclosure of Machine Tools Aids’ right to file the written statement and for pronouncement of judgment. 
 The Court noted that under the proviso to Rule 1 Order V, CPC, which is applicable to ordinary suits, the defendant is permitted to file a written statement beyond the 30 days period but within 90 days from the date of service of summons. However, the Court added that, “It is trite that this proviso has been held to be construed liberally and written statement even beyond 90 days period has been directed to be taken on record, for justifiable reasons”.
 The bench, however, added that the second proviso to Rule 1 Order V, as amended by the Commercial Courts Act and made applicable to the commercial suits, is restrictive in nature as compared to the first proviso which is applicable to the ordinary suits.
 The Court reckoned that as per Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC, as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, the defendant is required to file his written statement within a period of 30 days. However, the court may allow the defendant to file his written statement beyond the 30 days period but within 120 days “from the date of service of summons”. 
 Referring to the Proviso to Order VIII Rule 1 CPC, as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, the Court said, “the proviso is couched in a negative language and stipulates that the right to file written statement beyond 120 days by the defendant is automatically extinguished by operation of law”.
 “There is no manner of doubt, as stipulated in proviso to Rule 1 of Order V and Rule 1 of Order VIII CPC, that the 30 days period would commence on and from the date of service of summons containing a stipulation that it is obligatory on the part of the defendant to file his written statement, which would be a necessary concomitant to construe if any default in filing the written statement has occasioned," said the court.
  Thus, the bench concluded that it is imperative to direct the Civil Courts adjudicating commercial suits, to stipulate in its summons that it is obligatory on the part of the defendant to file his written statement within 30 days from the date of service/receipt of summons.
While taking note of the fact that the trial court upon perusal of its own record in the case filed by GNC Infra LLP had concluded that summons under Rule 5 Order V CPC were never issued in accordance with the prescribed procedure, the bench held that failure to issue summons cannot be detrimental to the rights provided to Machine Tools Aids.
“Logically, since no such summons were ever issued, the question of not having filed the Written Statement within 30 days period or the extended period of 120 days does not arise and the liability cannot be fastened upon the petitioner," the court said.
In view of the maxim “Actus Curaie Neminem Gravabit” too, the impugned order is unsustainable in law, said the court.
“In the facts of the present case and keeping in view the aforesaid legal position, it is obvious that the failure to file written statement within the stipulated period or even the extended period cannot to be detrimental to the interest of the petitioner/defendant. It is trite that procedures are handmaid of justice and the provisions are to be construed accordingly," the court ruled.
Observing that the written statement was indeed filed by the Machine Tools aids within five days from the order passed by the trial court directing it to file the same, the high court set aside the trial court’s order where it had allowed the application under Order VIII Rule 10 and foreclosed the Machine Tools Aids’ right to file the written statement.
"As a sequiter, the written statement filed by the petitioner is directed to be taken on record with the further directions to the Trial Court to proceed in accordance with law and as per the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as amended by the Commercial Courts Act 2015," the court said.

Punjab and Haryana High Court while dealing with a petition of an adoptive daughter of a government employee, whose application for the benefit of a family pension was dismissed on the sole ground of her being adopted after her father's retirement date, held that an adoption post-retirement would not be a ground to deny the benefit of the family pension to such child.
 Merely because the adoption is post retirement which is mainly for the purpose of providing dependency and also some light in the evening of the life of the couple. The same would not as such be good enough to deny the said child the benefit of the family pension merely on account of the fact that the decision as such to adopt was taken at a belated stage.
 The bench comprising Justice G.S. Sandhawalia and Justice Vikas Suri further noted that a child-less employee may adopt a child after retirement and the same cannot be a sole ground to deny the benefit of the family pension.
 Court further held that Note-1 of Clause (d) of Sub-rule (ii) of Rule 4 of the Family Pension Scheme, 1964 (as applicable to the State of Haryana) is liable to be quashed for being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India because it discriminates against children legally adopted after retirement and keeps them out of the ambit of the 'family' hence making them ineligible for a family pension. 
 In our considered opinion, the argument which has been raised as such by counsel for the petitioner is well justified that the said Note enhances the discrimination inter se children adopted before and after retirement and keep the ones adopted after retirement out of the ambit of family. They are, thus, excluded from the right of family pension, which is a beneficial provision to ensure that children of a retired government employee do not face any vagrancy. The Rule as such is thus liable to be quashed on the ground of being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India as it does not serve any purpose and discriminates against children legally adopted after retirement.
 The court, after relying on the judgments of the Supreme Court in Smt. Bhagwanti vs. Union of India, (1989) 4 SCC 397, Smt. Lakshmi Kunwar vs. State of Rajasthan, 1993 (8) SLR 427, Kanta Devi vs. UOI 1994 (5) SLR 279 and the judgment of Single Judge of this Court in Gurdial Singh vs. State of Haryana, (2000) 1 SCT 1072 held that the said Note suffers from the vice of discrimination and arbitrariness.
 Accordingly, the court allowed the writ petition and quashed Note-1 of Clause (d) of Sub-rule (ii) of Rule 4 of the Family Pension Scheme, 1964 (as applicable to the State of Haryana) to the extent it qualifies the adoption with the period of time.

The Supreme Court observed that the pre deposit of 75% of the awarded amount as per section 19 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Development Act, 2006, is mandatory to challenge the award under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
In this case, the Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court directed the Single bench to proceed under section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 without insistence for making predeposit of 75% of the awarded amount.
The issue therefore raised in appeal before the Apex Court was whether the pre ­deposit of 75% of the awarded amount as per section 19 of the MSMED Act, 2006, while challenge to the award under section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, is made mandatory or not.
The court noted that this issue has been answered in a recent judgment in Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority Vs. Aska Equipments Limited; (2022) 1 SCC 61.
"While interpreting section 19 of the MSMED Act, 2006 and after taking into consideration the earlier decision of this Court in the case of Goodyear (India) Ltd. Vs. Norton Intech Rubbers (P) Ltd.; (2012) 6 SCC 345, it is observed and held that the requirement of deposit of 75% of the amount in terms of the award as a pre­deposit as per section 19 of the MSMED Act, is mandatory. It is also observed that however, at the same time, considering the hardship which may be projected before the appellate court and if the appellate court is satisfied that there shall be undue hardship caused to the appellant/applicant to deposit 75% of the awarded amount as a pre­deposit at a time, the court may allow the pre­deposit to be made in instalments. Therefore, it is specifically observed and held that pre deposit of 75% of the awarded amount under section 19 of the MSMED Act, 2006 is a mandatory requirement."
The court therefore directed the respondent to deposit 75% of the awarded amount before its application under section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 challenging the award is entertained and considered on merits.

Can't Compel Wife To Live With Muslim Husband Who Has Married Again Against Her Will If It Isn't Equitable: Allahabad High CourtStressing that as per the mandate of the Holy Quran, bigamy is not sanctified unless a man can do justice to orphans, the Allahabad High Court has observed that a Muslim man has to prevent himself to perform a second marriage if he is not capable of fostering his wife and children.
"The religious mandate of Sura 4 Ayat 3 (of Quran) is binding on all Muslim men which specifically mandates all Muslim men to deal justly with orphans and then they can marry women of their choice two or three or four but if a Muslim man fears that he will not be able to deal justly with them then only one. If a Muslim man is not capable of fostering his wife and children then as per the above mandate of the Holy Quran, he cannot marry the other woman," the Bench of Justice Surya Prakash Kesarwani and Justice Rajendra Kumar-IV observed.
The Court made this observation while dismissing an appeal filed by a Muslim man challenging the family court's order dismissing his suit for restoration of conjugal rights in connection with his first wife (respondent).
The case in brief
It was the admitted case of the plaintiff-appellant/husband that he contracted a second marriage and did not disclose this fact to his first wife (defendant/respondent), however, he wished to live with both of his wives and since the first wife refused to live with him and share his consortium with another woman, he filed a plea seeking restoration of conjugal rights. Having heard both parties, the Family Court dismissed the husband's plea. Challenging this order, he moved to the High Court by way of filing the instant plea.
High court's observations
Dismissing his appeal, the High Court specifically observed that when the plaintiff-appellant contracted the second marriage suppressing this fact from his first wife, then such conduct of the plaintiff-appellant amounts to cruelty to his first wife. 
Under the circumstances, the Court further held that if the first wife does not wish to live with her husband-plaintiff appellant, then she cannot be compelled to go with him in a suit filed by him for restitution of conjugal rights. 
"If the contention of the plaintiff-appellant/ husband for the grant of decree of conjugal rights is accepted, then from point of view of the defendant-respondent/wife, it would amount to a breach of her fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India," he Court remarked.
Significantly, taking into account the fact that the husband had married again during the lifetime of his first time, leaving behind children born out of the said marriage, the Court referred to Sura 4 Ayat 3 of the Holy Quran to stress that as per Quran, bigamy is not sanctified unless a man can do justice to orphans, who in the present set of facts are the respondent and her children. 
"As per the mandate of the Holy Quran as noted above all Muslim men have to deal justly with orphans. A married Muslim man having his wife alive cannot marry another Muslim woman if he cannot deal justly with the orphan. A mandate has been given that in such circumstances a Muslim man has to prevent himself to perform a second marriage, if he is not capable of fostering his wife and children," the Court remarked as it dismissed the appeal filed by the Husband.

While considering a SLP assailing Orissa High Court's order, the Supreme Court recently deprecated the High Court's action of disposing a writ petition without applying its mind to the grounds or challenge of submission.
The Orissa High Court had dismissed the petition challenging the Orissa Administrative Tribunal's order by passing the following order, 
"Heard learned counsel for the parties. By way of this writ petition, the petitioners have challenged the judgment and order dated 14.11.2012 passed by the Orissa Administrative Tribunal, Bhubaneswar in OA No. 163 of2008. Taking into consideration the opposite party is working for a period of three decades, it will not be appropriate for us to disturb the findings of the Tribunal.Accordingly, the writ petition stands dismissed. However, this will not be treated as precedent."
While setting aside the High Court's judgement and remitting the proceedings back for a fresh decision, the bench in State of Orissa & Ors v. Prasanta Kumar Swain, the bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna observed,
"Ex facie, there has been no application of mind by the High Court to the grounds of challenge or to the submissions. In fact, the concluding line of the order of the High Court indicates that the decision will not be treated as a precedent. This was an inappropriate manner of disposing of a substantive petition under Article 226 of the Constitution since the High Court is duty bound to apply its mind to whether the judgment of the Tribunal is sustainable on facts and law."
Considering that the proceedings before the Tribunal were instituted in 2008, the Top Court also requested the High Court for expeditiously disposing the case within a period of three months from the receipt of a copy of the order. 
Case Title: State of Orissa & Ors v. Prasanta Kumar Swain| Civil Appeal No 154 of 2022
Coram: Justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna 

Coming down heavily on an educational institution for denying admission to a child with special needs, the Madras High Court observed that the institution had not only failed in performing its duty but had also brought bad repute to the Christian Missionary in whose name the institution was running.
 The sixth respondent is quite pathetically and ironically named after a third-generation American Medical Missionary in India. It makes me wonder whether those in administration today are riding on that name without following her principles or the core conduct which the noble lady adhered to.
 The court was hearing a plea by a child calling upon the State and the Education Department to ensure her admission in respondent school in line with the provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 and the National Trust For Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation and Multiple Disabilities Act, 1999. The petitioner's mother had contended that the child was denied admission merely by stating that she did poorly in her examination and interview when the child was only mildly autistic and was normal in all other aspects.
 Justice CV Karthikeyan noted that even though towards the end of the proceedings, the respondent school had remonstrated that it would appoint special educators and would also admit the child into their school, the same appeared to be a hollow submission.
 Such an offer should have given voluntarily. It should be from the heart. It should be in spirit and not in mere expression of words alone. I hold that the statement about willingness to appoint teachers trained to teach children with special needs had been stated only to brush under the carpet the earlier stand of refusal to look after those children. It is just white washing. There was no real intent.
 Referring to precedents from Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and the Madras High Court, the single judge noted that courts have always been sensitive to children with special needs and that educational institutions should rise to the occasion and motivate children to achieve their dreams.
 It is thus seen that the Courts have always been sensitive to children with special needs. They have expressed hope that educational institutions would not betray children with special needs. They have called upon educational institutions to rise to the occasion and extend their arms to those children. Education signifies pulling up from the depth a child and motivate him or her to achieve his or her dream. The sixth respondent has failed not only in this duty but also betrayed the name of the noble Missionary and extremely, extremely distressingly their Christian faith.
 The petitioners submitted that the school had taken an aggressive stand and refused admission to the child even though they belonged to the same community as that of the administrator of the respondent school. Even though the school’s website indicated that they offer education to children with special needs, they were now trying to evade responsibility.
 During the course of the hearing, the court also directed the State to schools in the district which offer education for special children. Additional Government Pleader U Baranitharan informed the court that there were three such schools and that state would take every step to ensure that the child is given good education in any of the three schools. He further submitted that the intention of the State was to provide education to special children in an inclusive environment and not to exclude them from main stream education.
 The court noted that it cannot thrust any child on any school and that it was for the child’s mother to decide assessing the best educational environment for the child. 
 The Court can only express it views. The Court cannot thrust any child on any school but can only open the hearts of those, who project to impart education, an education which is inclusive in nature. I would leave the options open.

The Supreme Court has observed that a daughter is capable of inheriting the self-acquired property or share received in the partition of a coparcenary property of her Hindu father dying intestate.
In this case, the property in question was admittedly the self-acquired property of Marappa Gounder. The question raised by the appellant was whether Late Gounder's sole surviving daughter Kupayee Ammal, will inherit the same by inheritance and the property shall not devolve by survivorship? The Court was considering the question whether a sole daughter could inherit her father's separate property dying intestate (prior to the enactment of Hindu Succession Act, 1956). 
To answer this issue, the Apex Court bench referred to customary Hindu Law and also judicial pronouncements, observed that the right of a widow or daughter to inherit the self-acquired property or share received in the partition of a coparcenary property of a Hindu male dying intestate is well recognized not only under the old customary Hindu Law but also various judicial pronouncements. 
"Right of a widow or daughter to inherit the self-acquired property or share received in partition of a coparcenary property of a Hindu male dying intestate is well recognized not only under the old customary Hindu Law but also by various judicial pronouncements".
The Court noted the following:
The Mitakshara law also recognises inheritance by succession but only to the property separately owned by an individual, male or female. Females are included as heirs to this kind of property by Mitakshara law. Before the Hindu Law of Inheritance (Amendment) Act 1929, the Bengal, Benares and Mithila sub-schools of Mitakshara recognised only five female relations as being entitled to inherit namely - widow, daughter, mother paternal grandmother and paternal great-grand mother. The Madras subschool recognized the heritable capacity of a larger number of females heirs that is of the son's daughter, daughter's daughter and the sister, as heirs who are expressly named as heirs in Hindu Law of Inheritance (Amendment) Act, 1929. The son's daughter and the daughter's daughter ranked as bandhus in Bombay and Madras. The Bombay school which is most liberal to women, recognized a number of other female heirs, including a half -sister, father's sister and women married into the family such as stepmother, son's widow, brother's widow and also many other females classified as bandhus. From the above discussions, it is abundantly clear that a daughter was in fact capable of inheriting the father's separate estate.The 174th Law Commission in its report on 'Property Rights of Women' while proposing reforms under the Hindu Law has observed as under :- "1.3.3 The Mitakshara law also recognising inheritance by succession but only to the property separately owned by an individual, male or female. Females are included as heirs to this kind of property by Mitakshara law"
Therefore, the court observed:
"From the above discussions, it is clear that ancient text as also the Smritis, the Commentaries written by various renowned learned persons and even judicial pronouncements have recognized the rights of several female heirs, the wives and the daughter's being the foremost of them.. The rights of women in the family to maintenance were in every case very substantial rights and on whole, it would seem that some of the commentators erred in drawing adverse inferences from the vague references to women's succession in the earlier Smritis. The views of the Mitakshara on the matter are unmistakable. Vijneshwara also nowhere endorses the view that women are incompetent to inherit" (Para 64-65)
If a property of a male Hindu dying intestate is a self-acquired property or obtained in partition of a co-parcenery or a family property, the same would devolve by inheritance and not by survivorship, and a daughter of such a male Hindu would be entitled to inherit such property in preference to other collaterals."
In the case, the court noted that the property in question was admittedly the self-acquired property of Marappa Gounder despite the family being in state of jointness upon his death intestate. Therefore, his sole surviving daughter Kupayee Ammal, will inherit the same by inheritance and the property shall not devolve by survivorship, the bench said while allowing the appeal.

The Kerala High Court recently ruled that a serving Government employee, who had earlier secured enrollment as an Advocate and had later suspended his legal practice for taking up the above Government employment, cannot be treated as a "member of the Bar" for the purpose of selection and appointment as Assistant Public Prosecutor Grade II.A Division Bench of Justice Alexander Thomas...
The Kerala High Court recently ruled that a serving Government employee, who had earlier secured enrollment as an Advocate and had later suspended his legal practice for taking up the above Government employment, cannot be treated as a "member of the Bar" for the purpose of selection and appointment as Assistant Public Prosecutor Grade II.
A Division Bench of Justice Alexander Thomas and Justice Viju Abraham observed that this was so since as per the Advocates Act and Bar Council of India Rules, a person who was initially enrolled as an Advocate and later voluntarily suspended from legal practice is not entitled to practise as an Advocate.
So the inevitable consequence of the statutory provisions is that the said person, who has initially secured enrollment with the State Bar Council and who later secured voluntary suspension of legal practice, consequent to taking up of employment, including public employment, will cease to have the right to be an Advocate or to practise as an Advocate, so long as the voluntary suspension is in force.
The Court also laid down that such an eligibility condition of being a member of the Bar should be possessed by the candidate not only on the last date of submission of the application to the Public Service Commission (PSC) but also thereafter, even on the date of advice by the PSC and the date of appointment order issued by the appointing authority, etc.
The petitioner had secured a law degree and thereafter got herself enrolled as an advocate before the Bar Council of Kerala in 2007. She practised as an advocate till she got appointed as Lower Division Typist (LDT) in the Excise Department of the State and joined government service in 2012.
Later, she produced an application before the Bar Council and got her legal practice suspended as per the Advocates Act and the Bar Council of India Rules and her voluntary suspension from legal practice was rendered on 10.10.2012.
Meanwhile, PSC issued a selection notification in 2017, inviting applications from eligible and qualified candidates for appointment as Assistant Public Prosecutor Gr.II in the State. One of the qualifications prescribed to hold the post mandated the applicant to be a member of the Bar with not less than three years of active practice in Criminal Courts.
The petitioner contended that since she had already enrolled as an Advocate, the mere fact that she had later suspended her legal practice to take up Government employment will not result in a scenario that she cannot be treated as a member of the Bar.
The respondents argued that the applicant cannot be treated as a member of the Bar after her voluntary suspension of legal practice in 2012 and at any rate, she cannot be treated as a member of the Bar in 2017.
Since the expression "member of the Bar" is not explicitly defined in the Advocates Act or in the rules framed thereunder, the Court conducted an elaborate study on the available law to come to a conclusion. 
The Court noted that the cumulative and combined effect of Rule 49 and Rule 5 is that, upon voluntarily suspending the practice, the person concerned will have to surrender the original certificate of enrollment to the State Bar Council. Similraly, a person who secures suspension of legal practice will cease to have the right to practise as an Advocate in terms of Sections30 and 33 of the Advocates Act as long as the said person is in employment.
Therefore, the Bench had no hesitation to hold that to describe a person as being a member of the Bar, he/she should be a member of the legal profession, who earns a livelihood through the profession of legal practice carried on the courts, Tribunals, etc.
"So long as a person like the applicant does not have the legal right to practise as an Advocate in terms of Secs.30 and 33 of the Act, in view of the abovesaid aspects and the consequences flowing from the Act and the Rules, it cannot be said that such a person should be a member of the Bar."
Since the applicant had taken up full-time Government employment, consequent to the voluntary suspension of legal practice, she ceases to have the legal right to practise as an Advocate and thus ceases to be an Advocate as long as the voluntary suspension is in force.
Yet another aspect pointed out by the Court was that the special rules require that the candidate should be a member of the Bar and must have had an active practice of not less than 3 years on the first day of the year in which the applications are invited. Therefore, it was clear that the applicant must be having active practice not only on the last date of submission of the application but also thereafter and up to his/her date of advice and regular appointment.
As held by the Patna High Court in Amar Sinha v. Bar Council [2017 KHC 2225], when a person having licensed to practise law under the Advocates Act, abandons his profession or is having no bonafide intent to continue in the profession, there is no reason to treat him as a member of the profession merely on the strength of his enrollment.
As such, the petition was dismissed.
Advocate N. Ashok Kumar appeared for the petitioner while the respondents were represented by Advocates Nirmal V. Nair, M. Aneesh and Rahul S. Nath. Senior Government Pleader Saigi Jacob Palatty and Standing Counsel P.C Sasidharan for the Kerala Public Service Commission also made appearance in the matter. 
Case Title: Saumya M.S. v. State of Kerala & Ors 

The Orissa High Court has held that a person in charge of a 'Trust' cannot be impleaded as an accused for dishonour of cheque, punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act ('the Act'), if the 'Trust' itself is not arraigned as a party as per the mandate of Section 141 of the Act. Notably, Section 141 prescribes liabilities of companies for dishonour of cheques.
 While quashing the order of cognizance made against the petitioner, General Secretary of a Trust, a Single Judge Bench of Justice Gourishankar Satapathy observed:
 "…there appears hardly any dispute about petitioner not to be a signatory of the cheque and her implication in this case as General Secretary of the Trust is without arraigning the "Trust" as an accused in the complaint, but Section 141 of NI Act makes it obligatory for the complainant-OP No.2 in this case to arraign the Trust as an accused to make the person in charge of and responsible to such Trust for the conduct of its business as vicariously liable for dishonor of cheque issued for the Trust, which was not done in this case…"
 Factual Background
 One Kanheilal Choudhury instituted a complaint case against the petitioner, General Secretary of M/s. Bijay Laxmi Trust, for commission of offences under Section 138 of the Act on account of dishonour of cheque issued by Dinabandhu Mishra as the President of the Trust.
 On perusal of complaint and initial statement of complainant along with documents annexed, the Magistrate Court took cognizance of the offence and issued summons to the petitioner and Dinabandhu Mishra. Being aggrieved, the petitioner approached the High Court for quashing the above order.
 Contentions of the Petitioner
 Mohit Agarwal, counsel for the petitioner flagged a preliminary objection at the threshold on the maintainability of the complaint as the Trust was not arraigned as an accused as required under Section 141 of the Act. He further submitted that the cheque in question was neither issued by the petitioner in individual capacity nor in the capacity of General Secretary of the Trust. Rather, it was issued by Dinabandhu Mishra as the President of the Trust and therefore, the criminal liability cannot be fastened against the petitioner.
 He also argued that Section 141 mandates arraignment of Trust as a party since the cheque in question was issued by a person for/on behalf of the Trust. As in the instant case, the above mandatory provision has not been complied, he submitted, the complaint itself is not maintainable. 
 Contentions of the Respondent
 Amit Prasad Bose, counsel for the complainant (herein O.P. No. 2) submitted that though the trust was not made an accused in the complaint, but that per se would not absolve the petitioner from the liability. Therefore, she is vicariously liable as the General Secretary of the Trust along with her husband, Dinabandhu Mishra, who had issued the cheque for the Trust. He argued that provisions of Section 141 would not stand on the way of discharge of the liability of the petitioner and her husband and thereby, the complaint is squarely maintainable.
 Court's Observations
 The Court noted that Section 141 of the Act talks about criminal liability for commission of offence under Section 138 by a company in case cheque was issued by or on behalf of the company and such criminal liability extends to every person, who at the time of the offence, was in-charge of and was responsible to the company for the conduct of its business.
 After perusing the complaint, the Court observed that it fails to aver clearly as to who was in charge of the Trust when the offence was committed. It said,
 "A bare perusal of the averments made in the complaint would unambiguously disclose that there are no averments in the complaint who, at the time when offence was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to the trust for the conduct of its business. Besides, the petitioner is admittedly neither the signatory of the cheque nor is there any averment made by the complainant in the complaint that the petitioner was in-charge of and was responsible to the trust for the conduct of its business. Undeniably the trust has not been made or implicated as an accused in the complaint."
 Again, the Bench placed reliance on the recent decision of the Apex Court in Pawan Kumar Goel v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr., wherein it was held that if the complainant fails to make specific averments against the company in the complaint for the commission of an offence under Section 138, the same cannot be rectified by taking recourse to general principles of criminal jurisprudence. 
 Further, it had clarified that the provisions of Section 141 impose vicarious liability by deeming fiction which requires the commission of the offence by a company or firm. Therefore, unless a company or firm has committed the offence as a principal accused, the persons mentioned in sub-Section (1) and (2) of Section 141 would not be liable to be convicted on the basis of the principles of vicarious liability.
 Having regard for the aforesaid, the Court concluded:
 "…the mandate of Section 141 of NI Act having not pleaded and established remotely in this case together with admittedly the incurable and inherent defect of non-impletion of the Trust as an accused in the complaint makes it very clear that the complaint is not maintainable in the eye of law and therefore, the further proceeding in the complaint is nothing but an abuse of process of Court and to secure the ends of justice, the complaint as a whole being unsustainable in the eye of law needs to be quashed…"
 Case Title: Bijaya Manjari Satpathy v. State of Orissa & Ors.

The Kerala High Court on Friday refused to grant anticipatory bail to a person who had attacked a doctor who examined his wife, alleging that the Doctor had misbehaved towards her. 
The Single Judge Bench of Justice A. Badharudeen was of the view that granting anticipatory bail in such a case would lead to a 'dangerous situation', whereby doctors, who are duty bound to treat patients as part of their oath, would not get protection and the the proper maintenance of health of the public at large would also be in peril.
"Doctors, who had turmoiled their energy and time to learn the method of treating patients, when examining patients clinically, they cannot do the said exercise without touching the patients. If a patient, who wants treatment, is aggrieved in the matter of touch on the body of the petitioner as part of examination, it is difficult for a doctor to do his medical profession by resorting to clinical examination. The same would include placing of Stethoscope on the left chest portion of the patient to observe and evaluate the heart beat. At the same time, this Court is conscious of the fact that all allegations on the ground of misbehaviour by overstepping the limit of the doctor while examining patients are false. Genuine cases of such nature could not be ruled out in toto. But generally, it could be held that truth of those allegations should be evaluated from the materials and attending circumstances to separate the grain from the chaff," the Court said.
The prosecution case was that the complainant, who is a doctor and doing on-call duty at the time, had examined the wife of the accused person. While so, the accused slapped the doctor on his cheek, alleging that the latter had touched the body of the accused's wife. The petitioner was therefore alleged to have committed offences punishable under Sections 341, 323 and 294(b) of the Indian Penal Code as well as under Sections 3 and 4 of the Kerala Healthcare Service Persons and Healthcare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property) Act, 2012. It is in this context that the petitioner accused has filed the instant application for anticipatory bail. 
It was contended by counsels for the petitioner that he was innocent in the case, and that the allegations against him were false. It was averred that the doctor had misbehaved towards the wife of the petitioner/accused, and for which, a complaint had been lodged by the latter against him, alleging commission of offence punishable under Section 354 IPC, for which the investigation was ongoing. The counsels thus submitted that, "this case was registered as a counterblast to avoid legal consequence, which would arise out of the case lodged by the wife of the accused". 
On the other hand, the Senior Public Prosecutor P.G. Manu refuted the same, and argued that the petitioner, who had criminal antecedents, and was already in four crimes, had manhandled the doctor while the latter was examining his wife, on the allegation that he touched her body. It was further contended that attacks against doctors were now on high alarm and they were thus under threat and fear, apprehending their implication in crimes, while doing their duty by clinically examining patients. "Therefore, threat against doctors would be detrimental to the interest of people at large. Thus it is submitted that this is not a fit case to grant anticipatory bail, where prosecution allegations are well made out," the Senior Public Prosecutor submitted. 
The Court in this case perused the records along with the scene mahazar and the statements of the witnesses, to ascertain that the prosecution case was well made out. 
"Be it so, the allegation of misbehaviour at the option of the doctor, that has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioner, alleged to be committed in the presence of two sisters and in an open space at the casualty of the hospital cannot be believed prima facie. It is relevant to note further that the allegation of misbehaviour was raised, after registration of this crime," the Court added in this regard. 
It is in this context that the Court arrived at the finding that attack against the doctor at the instance of the petitioner was well made out, and grant of anticipatory bail in such cases would lead to a dangerous situation. It added that in such cases, arrest and custodial interrogation would be 'necessary to accomplish successful investigation and eventful prosecution'. 
"Therefore, in such cases, grant of anticipatory bail, when prima facie the offences are made out, would not only spoil the investigation but would lead to traumatic situation. Therefore, I am not inclined to allow this petition," the Court held while dismissing the anticipatory bail application.
Advocates J.R. Prem Navaz, Sumeen S., and Muhammed Swadiq appeared on behalf of the petitioner. 
Case Title: Jamshid P.V. v. State of Kerala 

The Supreme Court observed that the recovery cannot be relied on under Section 27 of the Evidence Act in the absence of record of the statement of accused.
The bench of Justices B R Gavai and M M Sundresh acquitted a murder accused who was concurrently convicted by the Trial Court and the High Court.
Boby, along with other accused, were convicted for the offences punishable under Sections 395, 365, 364, 201, 380, 302 and 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC. In appeal, the contention raised on Boby's behalf was that a Memorandum under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is required in cases of recovery initiated at the instance of an accused person, based on the statements made before the Police. Neither such Memorandum was prepared at the time of the recovery of the body of deceased Vishwanathan, nor were signatures of independent or panch witnesses taken at the time of said recovery, it was contended.
The Apex Court bench noted that the trial court has relied on the following circumstances: (i) Last seen together with the deceased; (ii) Recovery of the stolen material including jewellery from accused No.3­Boby; (iii) Recovery of spade from accused No. 1­Shibu @ Shibu Singh; (iv) Recovery of the dead body at the instance of accused No. 3­ Boby;
Regarding the circumstance (iv), the bench noted that, there is no statement of Boby (accused No. 3/appellant herein) recorded under Section 27 of the Evidence Act. We are, therefore, of the considered view that the prosecution has failed to prove the circumstance that the dead body of the deceased was recovered at the instance of Boby, the bench said.
"In the present case, there is no statement of Boby (accused No. 3/appellant herein) recorded under Section 27 of the Evidence Act. We are, therefore, of the considered view that the prosecution has failed to prove the circumstance that the dead body of the deceased was recovered at the instance of Boby (accused No. 3/appellant herein)"
While setting aside the concurrent conviction, the court made the following observations regarding Section 27:
Section 27 of the Evidence Act requires that the fact discovered embraces the place from which the object is produced and the knowledge of the accused as to this, and the information given must relate distinctly to the said fact. The information as to past user, or the past history, of the object produced is not related to its discovery. (Chandran v. State of Tamil Nadu (1978) 4 SCC 90 ; State of Karnataka v. David Rozario (2002) 7 SCC 728 )
IO to draw the discovery panchnama as contemplated under Section 27 of the Evidence Act. Subramanya v. State of Karnataka (2022 SCC OnLine SC 1400 :  (SC) 887)
Two essential requirements for the application of Section 27 of the Evidence Act are that (1) the person giving information must be an accused of any offence and (2) he must also be in police custody. The Court held that the provisions of Section 27 of the Evidence Act are based on the view that if a fact is actually discovered in consequence of information given, some guarantee is afforded thereby that the information was true and consequently the said information can safely be allowed to be given in evidence (Suresh Chandra Bahri v. State of Bihar 1995 Supp. (1) SCC 80)

The Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench) has observed that the Court is not supposed to act in a mechanical manner, and force the parties to engage in mediation where the marriage has irretrievably broken down.
The Bench of Justice Rakesh Srivastava and Justice Ajai Kumar Srivastava-I further stressed that reference of the parties to mediation is not compulsorily required where the facts and circumstances of the case showcase that no purpose would be served out of such reference.
The Court made these observations in light of Section 9 of the Family Courts Act which casts a duty upon the Family Court to make efforts for settlement. The Court opined that the endeavor to get the matter settled is compulsory, but the reference to mediation by the Family Court itself is not.
The case in brief
Essentially, the Court was dealing with an appeal filed by one Anamika Srivastava (wife) under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act, 1984 challenging an order passed by the Family Court (Principal Judge, Family Court, Barabanki).
The family court had rejected the prayer made by her and the Respondent (husband) to waive the minimum period of six months stipulated under Section 13-B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 [Divorce by mutual consent] for a motion for passing a decree of divorce on the basis of mutual consent.
Before the Family court, the parties had stated that they are living separately for more than ten years; that before the Mediation Centre, the parties had, freely, on their own accord, without any coercion or pressure, arrived at a joint settlement. In the circumstances, six month waiting period be waived and a decree of divorce be passed forthwith.
However, their application was rejected by the Family Court on the ground that in terms of its order, the parties had not appeared before the mediation centre and, as such, there was no good ground to waive the statutory period of six months.
It may be noted that Section 13-B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act provides for a cooling period of six months from the date of filing of the divorce petition under Section 13-B(1), in case the parties should change their mind and resolve their differences. 
After six months if the parties still wish to go ahead with the divorce, and make a motion, the Court has to grant a decree of divorce declaring the marriage dissolved with effect from the date of the decree, after making such inquiries as it considers fit. 
However, in the instant case, the parties wanted the court waives the 6 months waiting period as their marriage had irretrievably broken down.
Court's observations 
The Court noted that the discretion to waive statutory period of six months is a guided discretion for consideration of the interest of justice where there is no chance of reconciliation and the parties were already separated for a longer period or contesting proceedings for a period longer than the period mentioned in Section 13-B(2) of the Act.
Further, the Court observed that Section 9 of the Family Courts Act makes it obligatory on the part of the Family Court to endeavor, in the first instance to effect a reconciliation or a settlement between the parties to a family dispute.
However, the Court added, the Court is not supposed to act in a mechanical manner, and force the parties to engage in mediation where the marriage has irretrievably broken down.
Against this backdrop, taking into account the facts of the instant case, the Court, allowed the appeal as it remarked thus:
"In the case at hand both the parties are well educated. Admittedly, the parties lived together only for three months and after which they have separated on account of irreparable differences. The parties have lived apart for more than eleven years. The parties have appeared before the Mediation and Conciliation Centre of this Court and have settled their dispute amicably. The parties are unwilling to live together as husband and wife. Even after eleven years of separation the parties still want to go for divorce. Considering that the parties had already engaged in mediation before the Mediation Centre of this Court, and had failed to reconcile, no purpose would be served by subjecting the parties to the same process again, especially when they have been living apart for several years, and the marriage has irretrievably broken down. No useful purpose would be served in keeping the petition pending except to prolong their agony"
Consequently, the statutory waiting period of six months under Section 13-B(2) of the Act was waived by the High court.
Case title - Anamika Srivastava v. Anoop Srivastava [FIRST APPEAL No. - 30 of 2022]

No stipulation that such 10 years standing is as Additional District Judge.The Delhi High Court has made it clear that a District Judge or a judicial officer of not less than 10 years standing is competent to hear appeals under Section 9 of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971.
 The Act provides for eviction of unauthorised occupants from public premises and empowers an Estate Officer to hold inquiries. Section 9 of the Act provides that an appeal shall lie from specified orders of the estate officer to an Appellate Officer.
 The question before the High Court was regarding which authority can be an Appellate Officer.
 The Petitioners herein had raised an objection that in view of Section 9 of the Act, the appeal can be heard either by the District Judge or by a judicial officer in that district having not less than 10 years service as Additional District Judge.
 However, the High Court noted that a bare perusal of Section 9 of the Act provides that the Appellate Officer shall be the District Judge of the district in which the public premises is situated or such other judicial officer in that district of not less than 10 years standing.
 "Reading of this provision nowhere provides that a judicial officer to be competent to hear the appeal must have a standing of 10 years or more than 10 years in service as an Additional District Judge," Justice Dinesh Kumar Sharma held.
 The Court held that if the legislature intended so, it could have mentioned it in the provision itself.
 Similarly, there is nothing as such in the provision that states that the judicial officer should have a service of 10 years or more than 10 years in the Higher Judicial Service, it added.
 Thus, the appeals were relegated back to the concerned Court.
 Case Title: M/S Young Men S Tennis Club v. NDMC

The Karnataka High Court has directed the prison authorities to consider the representation of a woman and release a murder convict on parole leave, for him to marry her or else she would be given in marriage to someone else.

The Karnataka High Court has directed the prison authorities to consider the representation of a woman and release a murder convict on parole leave, for him to marry her or else she would be given in marriage to someone else. 
A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna allowed the petition filed by Neetha G and Rathnamma and directed the authorities to release the convict Anand. It said “The respondents 2 and 3 are directed to consider the representations of the petitioners and release the detenue/Anand (convict Prisoner No.11699) on parole from the forenoon of 05.04.2023, till the evening of 20.04.2023.” 
It added “The respondents 2 and 3 shall stipulate strict conditions as are usually stipulated, to ensure return of the detenue to the gaol and that he shall not commit any other offence during the period of parole.” 
Neetha along with the convict’s mother had approached the court seeking a direction to the authorities to consider their representations on 25.03.2023 for release of the detenue on parole for a period of 15 days. 
It was contended by Neetha that she is in love with the detenue, and sought his release on account of the apprehension that she would be given in marriage to someone else. While, the mother submitted that she being an aged person and suffering from several ailments it is her wish to see the 2nd petitioner and the detenue - Anand being married and therefore, both have submitted the representations.
The counsel for the petitioners argued “The release of the detenue is imperative, otherwise, he will lose the love of his life. Being in prison, he cannot bear the agony of his love getting married to someone else and therefore, seeks emergency parole on any condition that would be imposed upon the petitioner.” 
On the other hand the government advocate submitted that “There is no provision for grant of parole to get married. If it were to be anybody else’s marriage that the detenue wanted to attend, it would have been a different circumstance. The objectives of parole as obtaining under Clause 636 of the Prison Manual would not enure to the benefit of the detenue for his release. Sub-clause 12 of Clause 636 of the Prison Manual gives the discretion to the Head of the Institution to grant parole on any other extraordinary circumstances.” 
The bench referred to the judgement of the High Court of Rajasthan in the case of Sanjay alias Gafudiya v. State of Rajasthan and that of Bombay High Court in the case of Cecilia Fernandes v. Inspector General, Panaji, wherein the courts had allowed emergency parole to a detenu for facilitating the purpose of marriage.
It then said “I deem it appropriate to allow the petition, owing to the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and in the interest of justice.” 
Further it clarified that the respondents 2 and 3 shall stipulate strict conditions as are usually stipulated, to ensure return of the detenue to the gaol and that he shall not commit any other offence during the period of parole.

The Delhi High Court has reiterated the position of law laid by the Apex Court that a Trial Court cannot qualify the imprisonment of life awarded by it to remainder of natural life. 
A division bench comprising of Justice Mukta Gupta and Justice Mini Pushkarna observed thus while awarding life sentence (for remainder of life) to three men for gang rape and murder of a three year old minor child, observing that the same was done in a diabolic and brutal manner.
The trial court had convicted the trio under sec. 376(2) and 302 of Indian Penal Code and had sentenced them to undergo life imprisonment for the remainder of their natural lives.
While upholding their conviction, the Bench observed that as per Union of India v. V. Sriharan @ Murugan & Ors., power to impose a modified punishment providing for any specific term of incarceration or till the end of the convict's life as an alternate to death penalty can be exercised only by the High Court and the Supreme Court and not by any other inferior Court.
Hence, the High Court was of the view that the impugned order on sentence to the extent it awards sentence for imprisonment of the remainder of the life to the appellants herein for offences punishable under Sections 376(2) and 302/34 IPC cannot be sustained.
The question before the High Court was thus whether High Court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction can direct that the life imprisonment awarded by trial court would be for the remainder of the life or a definite term.
The Court observed that though the Trial Court could not have qualified the imprisonment of life awarded by it to the remainder of the natural life of the convicts, the High Court though setting aside the said order in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, can award the same sentence on consideration of the facts of the case. 
The Court reiterated the position laid down in the judgments of Supreme Court in Union of India v. V. Sriharan @ Murugan & Ors. wherein it was held that the power to impose a modified punishment providing for any specific term of incarceration or till the end of the convict's life as an alternate to death penalty can be exercised only by the High Court and the Supreme Court and not by any other inferior Court.
The said position was reiterated in Gauri Shankar v. State of Punjab.
Thus, it exercised its appellate jurisdiction by awarding life sentence under sec. 376(2) and 302 of Indian Penal Code. It observed that the imprisonment of life for the remainder of life would be an appropriate sentence in the facts of the case.
Noting that death sentence was not awarded by the Trial Court, the Court observed that the sentence of life which would ordinarily be up to fourteen years after remissions would be highly inadequate, unjust and unfair to the victim.
"In the present case, the three appellants have been convicted for the gang rape and murder of a minor aged 3 years, thereby brutally mutilating her private parts and smothering her," the Court said.
Hence, it said that imprisonment of life for the remainder of life to the appellants would be an appropriate sentence in the facts of the case.
Thus, upholding the conviction of the appellants, the Court ordered thus:
"Consequently, upholding the conviction of the appellants for the offences punishable under Sections 376(2)(g) IPC, 302 IPC, 377 IPC and 201 IPC, and of appellant Jamahir for offence punishable under Section 363 IPC, though the order on sentence to the extent it directs the appellants to undergo imprisonment for the remainder of life as passed by the learned Trial Court is set aside for offences punishable under Sections 376(2) and 302 IPC, however, in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction and in view of diabolic and brutal manner in which rape with murder of a three year old child was committed, this Court deems it fit to award the same sentence i.e. remainder of the life for offences punishable under Sections 376(2) and 302 IPC. The sentence of simple imprisonment for 10 years for offence punishable under Section 377 IPC to all the appellants and imprisonment for 5 years to the appellant Jamahir for offence punishable under Section 363 IPC along with the fine imposed and the default sentences is upheld."
The appeals were accordingly disposed of. 
Case Title: JAMAHIR ALIAS JAWAHAR v. THE STATE GOVT OF NCT OF DELHI

The Supreme Court has held that for the purpose of the Juvenile Justice Act 2015, the age recorded by the Juvenile Justice Board or the Child Welfare Committee of the person so brought before it will be deemed to be the true age of the person.A Bench comprising Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice BV Nagarathna has made the observation while delivering its judgement in a plea...
The Supreme Court has held that for the purpose of the Juvenile Justice Act 2015, the age recorded by the Juvenile Justice Board or the Child Welfare Committee of the person so brought before it will be deemed to be the true age of the person.
A Bench comprising Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice BV Nagarathna has made the observation while delivering its judgement in a plea challenging Allahabad High Court's order sustaining the judgment of the District & Sessions Court as well as of the Juvenile Justice Board declaring the accused a juvenile delinquent.
In the present matter, victim of the crime had approached the Supreme Court challenging the declaration of the accused as a juvenile, arguing that the matriculation certificate can't be a conclusive document for determining the age of the juvenile irrespective of other material discrepancies in the oral testimony of the witnesses or other documents being produced.
The Bench has held that the deeming provision Section 94 (3) of the JJ Act, 2015 is significant inasmuch as 'the controversy or the doubt regarding the age of the child brought before the Committee or the JJ Board is sought to be set at rest at the level of the JJ Board or the Committee itself'.
"The age recorded by the Committee or the Board to be the age of the person so brought before it shall for the purpose of the JJ Act, 2015 be deemed to be the true age of the person. The deeming provision in sub-section (3) of section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 is also significant inasmuch as the controversy or the doubt regarding the age of the child brought before the Committee or the JJ Board is sought to be set at rest at the level of the JJ Board or the Committee itself"
According to the Bench, while Section 94 of the Act raises a presumption regarding juvenility of the age of the child brought before the JJ board or the Committee, in case the Board or Committee has reasonable grounds about them being a child or not, it can undertake the process of determination of age by seeking evidence.
Therefore the Bench has held that the presumption of the accused being a juvenile may not be drawn when the Committee or the Board has reasonable grounds for doubt regarding the person brought before it is a child or not. 
"Thus, in the initial stage a presumption that the child brought before the Committee or the JJ Board is a juvenile has to be drawn by the said authorities. The said presumption has to be drawn on observation of the child, However, the said presumption may not be drawn when the Committee or the Board has reasonable grounds for doubt regarding the person brought before it is a child or not." the Bench said.
The Bench has also specified the evidence on which the process of age determination can be done by the Board in cases of such doubts:
(i) Date of birth certificate from the school or the matriculation certificate from the concerned board, if available or in the absence thereof
(ii) The birth certificate given by a corporation or by a municipal authority or a panchayat and in the absence of the above
(iii) Age has to be determined by an ossification test or any other medical age determination test conducted on the orders of the committee or the board.
The Bench noted that in the instant case, there is no other document indicating the date of birth of the person contrary to what has been indicated in the matriculation certificate and therefore such a discrepancy in the date of birth does not arise.
While noting that no contra evidence to the documents produced by the second respondent have been produced by the appellant, the Bench refused to differ from the order of the High court.
In the present case, the Juvenile Justice Board had observed that a letter dated 22nd July 2020 issued by the Office of the Administrative Officer, Intermediate Education Council, Meerut, UP, revealed that the date of birth of accused had rightly been recorded as 25.09.2004 in the High School mark-sheet, and he was 15 years and 8 months of age as on the date of the incident.
Through its order dated 11th November 2020, the JJ Board declared the accused as a juvenile delinquent in case for offences under sections 147, 148, 149, 323, 307, 302 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code. 
The District and Sessions Court and High Court sustained the Board's order holding that section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 had been complied with in the instant case inasmuch as the matriculation or equivalent certificate from the concerned Examination Board had indicated his date of birth to be 25.09.2004.
Therefore, it was held by the impugned order that Sub-section 2 of Section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 applies in the present case as there were no reasonable ground to doubt the said document, and in the absence of there being any evidence to negate the same, the criminal revision was dismissed.
Principles relating to determination of juvenility
The judgment authored by Justice Nagarathna also summarized the principles relating to the determination of juvenility as follows :
(i)	A claim of juvenility may be raised at any stage of a criminal proceeding, even after a final disposal of the case. A delay in raising the claim of juvenility cannot be a ground for rejection of such claim. It can also be raised for the first time before this Court.
(ii)	An application claiming juvenility could be made either before the Court or the JJ Board.
(iia)	When the issue of juvenility arises before a Court, it would be under sub-section (2) and (3) of section 9 of the JJ Act, 2015 but when a person is brought before a Committee or JJ Board, section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 applies.
(iib)	If an application is filed	before the Court	claiming juvenility, the provision of sub-section (2) of section	94 of the	JJ Act, 2015 would have to be	applied or	read along	with sub-section (2)	of	section	9	so as to seek evidence for the purpose of recording a finding stating the age of the person as nearly as may be.
(iic)	When an application claiming juvenility is made under section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 before the JJ Board when the matter regarding the alleged commission of offence is pending before a Court, then the procedure contemplated under section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 would apply. Under the said provision if the JJ Board has reasonable grounds for doubt regarding whether the person brought before it is a child or not, the Board shall undertake the process of age determination by seeking evidence and the age recorded by the JJ Board to be the age of the person so brought before it shall, for the purpose of the JJ Act, 2015, be deemed to be true age of that person. Hence the degree of proof required in such a proceeding before the JJ Board, when an application is filed seeking a claim of juvenility when the trial is before the concerned criminal court, is higher than when an inquiry is made by a court before which the case regarding the commission of the offence is pending (vide section 9 of the JJ Act, 2015).
(iii)	That when a claim for juvenility is raised, the burden is on the person raising the claim to satisfy the Court to discharge the initial burden. However, the documents mentioned in Rule 12(3)(a)(i), (ii), and (iii) of the JJ Rules 2007 made under the JJ Act, 2000 or sub-section (2) of section 94 of JJ Act, 2015, shall be sufficient for prima facie satisfaction of the Court. On the basis of the aforesaid documents a presumption of juvenility may be raised.
(iv)	The said presumption is however not conclusive proof of the age of juvenility and the same may be rebutted by contra evidence let in by the opposite side.
(v)	That the procedure of an inquiry by a Court is not the same thing as declaring the age of the person as a juvenile sought before the JJ Board when the case is pending for trial before the concerned criminal court. In case of an inquiry, the Court records a prima facie conclusion but when there is a determination of age as per sub-section (2) of section 94 of 2015 Act, a declaration is made on the basis of evidence. Also the age recorded by the JJ Board shall be deemed to be the true age of the person brought before it. Thus, the standard of proof in an inquiry is different from that required in a proceeding where the determination and declaration of the age of a person has to be made on the basis of evidence scrutinised and accepted only if worthy of such acceptance.
(vi)	That it is neither feasible nor desirable to lay down an abstract formula to determine the age of a person. It has to be on the basis of the material on record and on appreciation of evidence adduced by the parties in each case.
(vii)	This Court has observed that a hyper-technical approach should not be adopted when evidence is adduced on behalf of the accused in support of the plea that he was a juvenile.
(viii)	If two views are possible on the same evidence, the court should lean in favour of holding the accused to be a juvenile in borderline cases. This is in order to ensure that the benefit of the JJ Act, 2015 is made applicable to the juvenile in conflict with law. At the same time, the Court should ensure that the JJ Act, 2015 is not misused by persons to escape punishment after having committed serious offences.
(ix)	That when the determination of age is on the basis of evidence such as school records, it is necessary that the same would have to be considered as per Section 35 of the Indian Evidence Act, inasmuch as any public or official document maintained in the discharge of official duty would have greater credibility than private documents.
(x)	Any document which is in consonance with public documents, such as matriculation certificate, could be accepted by the Court or the JJ Board provided such public document is credible and authentic as per the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act viz., section 35 and other provisions.
(xi)	Ossification Test cannot be the sole criterion for age determination and a mechanical view regarding the age of a person cannot be adopted solely on the basis of medical opinion by radiological examination. Such evidence is not conclusive evidence but only a very useful guiding factor to be considered in the absence of documents mentioned in Section 94(2) of the JJ Act, 2015.

In a significant observation, the Allahabad High Court has said that it is the responsibility of the Parliament to show its collective will to restrain the criminals from entering into the politics, Parliament, or legislature to save democracy and the country governed on democratic principles and rule of law.
The Bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh observed thus while denying bail to a sitting Member of Parliament (Bahujan Samaj Party), Atul Rai in connection with an Abetment of suicide case. The bench also noted that Rai is facing 23 criminal cases, which include cases of kidnapping, murder, rape, and other heinous offences.
The case in brief
A case was registered against Rai under Sections 376, 420, 406, and 506 IPC on a complaint by a victim, who later on attempted to commit suicide along with her friend within the precincts of the Supreme Court India in August 2021.

They were admitted in very serious and critical conditions to the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi, and later on, they died on 21.08.2021 and 24.08.2021 respectively. Pursuant to their unfortunate death, the instant case was registered against Rai under Sections 120B, 167, 195A, 218, 306, 504, and 506 IPC.
Now, seeking bail in the instant case, Rai had moved the High Court, however, denying him bail, the Court noted that Rai is a 'Bahubali, a criminal turned politician which was evident from his long criminal history of heinous offences.
The Court also observed that in the rape case against Rai (lodged by the victim), after the police investigated the offence and filed a charge sheet against him, he had terrorized and put undue pressure on the victim/prosecutrix, and had got several cases registered against her and her friend/witness so that they would not support the prosecution case.
The Court also took into account an application given by the victim to the Senior Superintendent of Police, Varanasi alleging that Rai was abating and drawing her close to committing suicide and that she was being continuously harassed physically and mentally and subjected to cruelty to change her stand before the Court. 
Court's significant observations regarding the entry of criminals into Politics 
At the outset, the Court called it unfortunate and the greatest irony of the largest democracy of the world that as many as 43 per cent of the members of Lok Sabha who got elected in the 2019 general elections are having criminal cases including cases related to heinous offences pending against them.
The court also observed that there have been several instances of persons charged with serious and heinous offences like murder, rape, kidnapping and dacoity and they got tickets to contest elections from political parties and even got elected in a large number of cases. 
Referring to Apex Court's observations in the case of Public Interest Foundation & Ors vs Union of India & Anr : (2019) 3 SCC 224, the Court observed thus:
"The Supreme Court has said that this leads to a very undesirous and embarrassing situation of law breakers becoming law makers and moving around police protection. The Supreme Court in the said case has directed the Election Commission of India to take appropriate measures to curb criminalization in politics but unfortunately collective will of the Parliament has not moved in the said direction to protect the Indian Democracy going in the hands of criminals, thugs and law breakers. If the politicians are law breakers, citizens cannot expect accountable and transparent governance and the society governed by the rule of law be an utopian idea. After independence with every election, role of identities such as caste, community, ethnicity, gender, religion etc, has been becoming more and more prominent in giving tickets to winnable candidates. These identities coupled with money and muscle power has made entry of criminals in politics easy and every political party without exception (may be with some difference in degree and extent) uses these criminals to win elections. Giving tickets to candidates with serious criminal charges would break the confidence and trust of the civil society, law abiding citizens of this country in the electoral politics and elections."
The Court also underscored that earlier, 'Bahubalis' and other criminals used to provide support to candidates on various considerations including caste, religion and political shelter but now criminals themselves are entering into politics and getting elected as the political parties do not have any inhibition in giving tickets to candidates with criminal background including those having heinous offence(s) registered against them. 
Further, the Court also stressed upon the responsibility of civil society as well to rise above the parochial and narrow considerations of caste, community etc and to ensure that a candidate with criminal background does not get elected.
Lastly, opining that Parliament and the Election Commission of India are required to take effective measures to wean away criminals from politics and break the unholy nexus between criminal politicians and bureaucrats, the Court remarked thus:
"There is an unholy alliance between organized crime, the politicians and the bureaucrats and this nexus between them have become pervasive reality. This phenomenon has eroded the credibility, effectiveness, and impartiality of the law enforcement agencies and administration. This has resulted into lack of trust and confidence in administration and justice delivery system of the country as the accused such as the present accused-applicant win over the witnesses, influence investigation and tamper with the evidence by using their money, muscle and political power. Alarming number of criminals reaching Parliament and State Assembly is a wake up call for all."

Stressing that the protection of the life of the individuals engaged in election duty during COVID-19 is an absolute duty of the State, the Allahabad High Court has ordered the State Government to release the ex-gratia payment to the dependents of such individuals who died due to COVID in and around their election duty during COVID-19 second wave (April-May 2021).
 The bench of Justice Attau Rahman Masoodi and Justice Vikram D. Chauhan also held that if a person, who was admitted to the hospital as a COVID patient, died due to heart failure or any other reason, even then, such death will be considered a COVID Death and the government shall be liable to provide an ex-gratia amount to the relatives of the deceased.
 The case in brief
 The Uttar Pradesh Government came up with a compensation scheme wherein an ex-gratis amount of 30 Lacs was to be provided to the dependents of the people who died due to COVID while being on election duty during UP Panchayat Polls last year.
 Under this scheme, the State Government decided to cover such COVID-19 deaths which occur within 30 days of the election duty. 
 It was further provided that the test reports Antigen/RT PCR positive, blood report, or CT scan would be sufficient proof to prove that the death occurred on account of COVID-19.
 Further, it was also provided that an asymptomatic case meeting with the death on account of COVID-19 within 30 days of election duty would also be covered under the scheme.
 Now, certain dependents of the individuals moved their writ plea before the Court claiming that their kins who were assigned election duty in UP Panchayat Elections last year, died after contracting COVID-19, however, they were denied the benefit of the State Government's scheme to provide compensation for such deaths.
 The State Government's stand was that any death that occurs beyond a period of 30 days from the date of election duty is not relatable to the election duty, hence the claims related to such death would be liable to be rejected as was the case with the petitioners.
 Court's observations 
 Perusing the scheme of the State Government, the Court noted that it was clear that any case detected beyond the period of 30 days from election duty as covid positive was certainly a category not covered under the scheme. 
 However, the Court observed that the death of asymptomatic cases within 30 days of election duty as per the mandate of government order was covered under the scheme provided that the death certificate on account of COVID-19 is produced by the claimants. 
 In view of this, the Court opined that the two situations that deserved to be treated at par are; firstly, where the death occurred due to covid-19 within a period of 30 days of participation in election duty in an asymptomatic case and; 
 secondly, where the infection of COVID-19 was detected within 30 days of election duty but the death occurred thereafter during treatment or otherwise.
 In other words, the Court was of the opinion that there was no such difference between a death that occurred due to COVID (being an asymptomatic case) within 30 days and a death that occurred after 30 days, however, a COVID case was detected within the 30 days of the election duty.
 To justify its stand, the Court further opined thus 
 "The bar of 30 days period in the cases where the infection was detected within 30 days of election duty but death occurred beyond the same is not attributable to any negligence on the part of victim that would defeat the claim rather it is owing to the lack of extraordinary care or treatment of which the duty would lay on the State. Therefore, all the detected cases within 30 days of election duty cannot be segregated from those where the infection despite remaining undetected resulted into the death of a victim due to COVID-19 within the period prescribed i.e. 30 days. Any other principle derived by the State on the basis of scientific understanding is bound to defeat the very object of the Government Order and the purpose will frustrate."
 The Court also observed that the State ought not to be driven by the scientific understanding of the situation alone but what is relevant is the general perception of people which settles for acceptance. 
 "If the judiciary cannot form an opinion contrary to law, it equally applies on the executive not to loose sight of the purpose for which laws are made. Scientific reasons are not always sacrosanct (16) but what remains is the purpose and objects of legislation," the Court said as it opined that it said that it was not necessary for the state government to accept non-verified scientific claims that a COVID-19 patient from the date of disease onset had mortality expectancy within 28 days.
 Consequently, the Court observed that the state's policy must be read beneficially for those cases too which were detected within 30 days and in that event, the date of death would become immaterial once it is on account of COVID19.
 "…(we) expect the State to implement the impugned clause of Government Order dated 1st June, 2021 without discriminating between the deaths of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases on the yardstick of 30 days from the date of election duty. It must be read beneficially for those cases too which were detected within 30 days and in that event, the date of death would become immaterial once it is on account of COVID19."
 Now, regarding the claims of the petitioners, the Court said that the real test as to whether one person died due to COVID or not would be governed by the rule that once the admission of deceased persons was on account of Covid-19, the resulting cause being heart failure or dysfunction of any other organ leading to death is immaterial and would nevertheless be treated as Covid-19 death.
 As a result, barring one writ petition, all the other petitions were allowed and the State of UP was directed to release the ex-gratia payment to the dependents entitled thereto within a period of one month.
 Each of the petitioners, whose claims are allowed shall be entitled to a cost of Rs. 25000/- in each case, the Court further ruled.

The Delhi High Court has set aside the proceedings under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 against Indiabulls Housing and Finance Limited (IHFL) and its employees.
The division bench of Justice Anish Dayal and Justice Mukta Gupta relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Vijay Madanlal Choudhary & Ors Vs. Union of India & Ors. The supreme court held that authorities under the PMLA cannot resort to action against any person for money laundering on the assumption that the property recovered by them must be proceeds of crime and that a scheduled offence has been committed. The scheduled offence must be registered with the jurisdictional police or pending inquiry by way of complaint before the competent forum. In the event that there is already a registered scheduled offence but the person named in the criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence is finally absolved by a court of competent jurisdiction owing to an order of discharge, acquittal or quashing of the criminal case of the scheduled offence, there can be no action for money laundering against not only such a person but also any person claiming through him in relation to the property linked to the stated scheduled offence.
The court quashed the proceedings while noting that the Bombay High Court had quashed the scheduled offence on the basis of which the ECIR was registered, alleging offences under PMLA.
The court noted that the order of the Bombay High Court was final and any other allegation against the accused in the FIR or any other person not accused in the FIR is a matter which would be for the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction to decide in an appropriate proceeding before that court.
The petitioners have challenged the continuation of proceedings in relation to the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) issued by the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) despite the predicate offence registered under FIR having been quashed by the judgement of the High Court of Bombay.
The petitioners contended that the summons issued by the ED to various petitioners in respect of the ECIR, the Look Out Circular (LOC), and any other consequential proceedings emanating from the ECIR may be set aside.
The department contended that the FIR still subsists since it has only been quashed by the petitioners before the Bombay High Court and not in toto.
The department submitted that Section 66 allows the ED to give an opinion on the basis of information or material in their possession that provisions of any other law are being contravened and accordingly share the information with the appropriate authorities for necessary action.
The petitioner contended that once the Bombay High Court has quashed the scheduled offence on the basis of which the ECIR was registered, alleging offences under PMLA, the question of the ECIR's being sustained does not arise.
The petitioner stated that under Section 66(2) of the PMLA if any contravention is noticed by a person, at any stage if any facts are indeed found or discovered, the authorities would have the liberty to exercise their rights under applicable law and file a fresh FIR if so necessitated.
The court set aside all proceedings arising from the ECIR and directed that there would be no further coercive action, search and seizure, or summons arising from the ECIR.

In a recent order, the Gujarat High Court has affirmed that when a person is transferred on his own request, his past service is counted while granting promotion or higher pay scale, particularly when the same department is involved. 
Thus, Justice Biren Vaishnav allowed the petition of workmen who were challenging a resolution of 2017 passed by the Finance Department stating that incumbents who had worked for five years would be considered for seniority, promotion, higher pay and terminal benefits from the initial date of engagement but not from the date of regularisation as was the case of the Petitioner. The bench reiterated:
 "In the case before the Supreme Court and of the Division Bench of this Court, the Court held that if the petitioners were transferred to a new department, they may not get seniority but the past experience would count for the purposes of promotion and higher pay scale etc."
 It was observed that the Petitioners were initially appointed as revenue Talatis on a fixed wage basis and later got the benefit of an inter-district transfer post their period of regular service of 5 years. The order of transfer indicated that the incumbent would lose seniority and an undertaking to the same effect was signed by the Petitioner. Due to this undertaking, the Petitioner effectively lose two years of his service on a regular basis for the purpose of seniority.
 In the instant case, the Petitioner challenged the notice of 2017 with the contention that all employees would get benefits of the initial date of appointment for all purposes but the Petitioners who were appointed prior to the resolution, due to the transfer, would lose 2 years of seniority. Further, their past service of 5 years would also not be taken into account for any purpose. Reliance was placed on State of Maharashtra v. Uttam Powar, to aver that when a person is transferred on his own request, his past service has to be taken into account for promotion. 
 Relying on Uttam Pawar, the Bench observed:
 "Therefore, in view of the consistent approach of this court, it is no more res integra that the incumbent on transfer to the new department may not get the seniority but his experience of the past service rendered will be counted for the purpose of other benefits like promotion or for the higher pay scale as per the Scheme of the Government."
 It was further opined that the Petitioners had a much better case than the workmen in Uttam Pawar since they had a transfer within the department on a fixed pay.
 Hence it was held that the loss of two years would cumulatively damage the case of the Petitioners in matters of promotion and they will continue to stagnate because other appointees post these resolutions would 'steal a march' over the Petitioners. This could not have been the intention of the undertaking, per the Bench.
 Hence, the undertaking was deemed inoperative and seniority was held to be counted from the date of initial appointment post five years.

The Bombay High Court on Monday discharged a 2017 contempt notice against Advocate Mathews Nedumpara after accepting his "bona fide, unconditional and unqualified" apology. "We do so because it is within our power and remit to accept an apology in these terms, and also because we believe that the contempt powers of this Court must be exercised sparingly. Where there is an apology...
The Bombay High Court on Monday discharged a 2017 contempt notice against Advocate Mathews Nedumpara after accepting his "bona fide, unconditional and unqualified" apology.
 "We do so because it is within our power and remit to accept an apology in these terms, and also because we believe that the contempt powers of this Court must be exercised sparingly. Where there is an apology that meets the requirements of the statute itself, and is to the satisfaction of the Court, surely no further action is required," a full bench of Justices Gautam Patel, MS Karnik and Bharati Dangre observed. 
 Nedumpara was issued a contempt notice for his behaviour after a division bench questioned him on the maintainability of his client's petition. 
 Earlier this week, the full bench clarified it was not condoning Nedumpara's acts by accepting the apology and "deprecated" his conduct. "Everyone has bad days. Counsel — and possibly even judges — are no exceptions. The question is how such a momentary lapse should be approached."
 However, they also wondered if a superior court's power of contempt should be used on every occasion or if courts should administer justice tempered with mercy. "We do not understand this to mean unwarranted leniency by the court, nor that courts must be timorous and let themselves be intimidated."
 "But Courts are, after all, institutions of a great formality. The administration of justice, and more particularly public faith in the administration of justice, depends not just upon how it is administered, but also on how it is seen to be administered. This requires certain standards of conduct throughout the day."
 Even as Amicus Curiae Shyam Mehta urged the court to direct Nedumpara to give an undertaking of good behaviour, the bench refused to do so. 
 "We appreciate Mr Mehta's concern, but it is not our intention to humiliate anyone; and certainly not by an order of a court. We need no such undertaking to be separately voiced, for the simple reason that this undertaking is part and parcel of the very sanad that allows every advocate to practice law," the order read. 
 While Nedumpara offered an explanation for his conduct, he eventually said through his advocate Subhash Jha that "he regrets his conduct." Adding "there was undoubtedly a lapse on his part and a momentary failure to observe and maintain the discipline and decorum necessary in any court of law. But this was inadvertent; perhaps in the heat of the moment."
Earlier, in March 2019, the Supreme Court had held Nedumpara guilty of committing contempt in the face of court for making reference to the Senior Advocate Fali S Nariman while alleging that only sons and daughters of judges were given senior designation. He was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment in the case and was also barred from appearing in SC for a period of one year.
 Case Title: High Court of Judicature at Bombay Versus Mathews J Nedumpara, Advocate

The Supreme Court observed that the requirement to frame substantial question of law in a second appeal is not a mere formality, but is meant to be adhered to.The limitation on the exercise of power by the High Court in the Second Appeal interfering with the judgment of the First Appellate Court is premised on high public policy, the bench of Justices KM Joseph and S. Ravindra Bhat...
The Supreme Court observed that the requirement to frame substantial question of law in a second appeal is not a mere formality, but is meant to be adhered to.
The limitation on the exercise of power by the High Court in the Second Appeal interfering with the judgment of the First Appellate Court is premised on high public policy, the bench of Justices KM Joseph and S. Ravindra Bhat observed.
In this case, the plaintiff filed a suit to declare that he has easementary right through defendant's property. The suit was dismissed by the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court dismissed the appeal. The High Court, allowed the second appeal, and decreed the suit.
Before the Apex Court, the appellant contended that the second Appeal could have been maintained before the High Court under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure only if a substantial question of law arises for its consideration. A perusal of the impugned judgment would show that a substantial question of law is conspicuous by its absence, he contended. The respondent, on the other hand, contended that, at the time when the Second Appeal was admitted, a substantial question of law was indeed framed by the High Court.
Perusing the judgment, the bench observed that the High Court has not framed any substantial question of law. In this regard, the bench observed:
The scheme of the Code of Civil Procedure accords finality to the findings of fact rendered by the First Appellate Court.This is undoubtedly subject to various well known exceptions which, however, cannot permit the Second Appellate Court to interfere with the findings of fact as a matter of course. Such restrictions are placed on the High Court in order that there is finality to litigation at a particular level in the hierarchy of Courts. The limitation on the exercise of power by the High Court in the Second Appeal interfering with the judgment of the First Appellate Court is premised on high public policy. This limitation is sought to be secured by insisting upon the requirement that a Second Appeal is considered only when there is a substantial question of law. Therefore, the existence of substantial question of law and the judgment which revolves around answering the substantial questions of law are not mere formalities. They are meant to be adhered to. (Para 11 and 12)
The court noticed that the First Appellate Court has come to the conclusion that the case based on Section 15 of the Indian Easements Act, 1882 is not made out. "Easement is a right. It may fall under any of the different kinds of easements but short of a right which it is for the plaintiff to establish, there cannot be a natural right as it were to make use of the property of another.", the court said.
The court also added that even the substantial question of law, which is said to have been framed by the High Court at the time when the Second Appeal was admitted, really does not appeal to it as a substantial question of law. Even though it may be true that initially the High Court while admitting the Second Appeal may have framed a question of law but the judgment in the instant case is unsupportable, the court said while allowing the appeal.

Stressing that when Medical Infrastructure which couldn't meet the medical requirements of our people in normal times then it definitely had to collapse in the face of the present pandemic, the Allahabad High Court in Monday (May 17) suggested several measures for the development of the medical infrastructure in the State.
 A Division Bench of Justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar also observed,
 "So far as the medical infrastructure is concerned, in these few months we have realized that in the manner it stands today, it is very delicate, fragile and debilitated"
 Further, the Court suggested the following measures and asked the Government to check their viability at the highest level and file a report on the next date:
 All nursing homes should have an oxygen facility on every bed. Every nursing home/ hospital which has more than 20 beds should have at least 40 percent beds as Intensive Care Units. Of the designated 40 percent; 25 percent should have ventilators, 25 percent should have High Flow Nasal Cannula and 50 percent of the 40 per cent reserved beds should have BiPAP machines. This should be made compulsorily for all the nursing homes/ hospitals in the State of Uttar Pradesh. Every nursing home/ hospital which has more than 30 beds should compulsorily have an oxygen production plant. In the State of Uttar Pradesh, we find that apart from various Institutes like Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute and the Universities like the King George's Medical University and Banaras Hindu University, we have five more medical colleges in Prayagraj, Agra, Meerut, Kanpur and Gorakhpur. These Colleges should have enhanced facilities as are there with the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute within a period of four months. Emergency laws should be applied for the acquisition of land for them. Funds should be provided to them forthwith so that they graduate from a medical college to an Institute of the standard of the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute. For this there should also be given a certain extent of autonomy. 
 Regarding the medical infrastructure in villages and small urban towns, the Court said that they should be given all kinds of pathology facilities and treatments should be made available in Community Health Centres which are at par to the treatment given by Level-2 hospitals in bigger cities. 
 Importantly, the Court said,
 "If a patient however becomes serious in the rural areas or in small towns then ambulances with all kinds of Intensive Care Unit facilities should be provided so that the patient can be brought to a hospital which has proper medical facilities in a bigger town." 
 Other measures suggested by the Court
 Every B Grade and C Grade town of the State of Uttar Pradesh should be provided with at least 20 ambulances and every village should be provided with at 14 least 2 ambulances having Intensive Care Unit facilities. Ambulances should be made available within a period of one month. With these ambulances' patients from smaller towns and villages can be brought to bigger hospitals in bigger towns. 
 Importantly, the Court asked the Government to not linger this matter and by the next date come up with a definite report as to how this upgradation of Medical Colleges shall be done in four months' time.
 Lastly, the Court directed the appointment of Nodal Officers by the District Judges of districts Bijnor, Bahraich, Barabanki, Shrawasti, Jaunpur, Mainpuri, Mau, Aligarh, Etah, Etawah, Firozabad, and Deoria in terms of its order dated 27.04.2021. 
 The Court has asked them to submit their reports within a week's time in the light of directions contained in its order dated 27.04.2021. 
 The State respondents have also been directed to give the details relating to the above districts in terms of our order dated 11.05.2021.

In a major relief to an Assistant Professor at the Industrial Engineering Department of LE College, Morbi, the Gujarat High Court has directed the respondent authorities to grant him an Academic Grade Pay (AGP) of Rs. 8,000 from 2010 onwards and consequential benefits of INR 9,000 from 2013.
Justice Vaishnav noted that except for certain adverse remarks from 2009-10, there were no adverse remarks against the Petitioner in the 19 years of service that he had rendered. The issue of unauthorised pay was an aspect of penalty even as the other remarks regarding his ability to decisions or lack of initiative were not so grave so as to deprive him of the AGP. The High Court remarked:
"For these two purported adverse instances the financial loss that has occurred to the petitioner is denial of AGPs consequentially based on the communication of 2019."
 The Petitioner-Professor was appointed as a Lecturer in the aforesaid college in 1999 and thereafter, in 2007, on completion of six years of service on the same post, he was extended the benefit of Senior Scale of INR 10,000-15,200. He was also designated as an Assistant Professor in 2011. The Petitioner, in 2018, made an application requesting that he was entitled to the upward movement of AGP from INR7,000 to INR 8,000. Subsequently, he moved a similar application for the benefit of upward movement from INR 8,000 to INR 9,000 from 2013, as well. However, the benefit of AGP was granted from 2015 onwards rather than on the completion of five years from 2005 basis certain 'adverse remarks' for the year 2009-10.
 The Petitioner submitted that the denial of AGP of INR 8,000 and consequential AGP of INR 9,000 based on the 'adverse remarks' was incorrect. Against the column of 'initiative, resourcefulness and willingness to assume responsibilities' the Petitioner was shown to be weak. Against the column of 'capacity to take quick and sound decisions', it was stated that the petitioner lacks the ability to take quick decisions. Lastly, with regards to 'disciplinary action', it was stated that the Petitioner was on an unauthorised leave for a day. 
Taking into account all these assessments, the Petitioner was not granted AGP at par with other Assistant Professors. It was contested that the remarks were 'not so adverse' that the Petitioner should be denied AGP. Per contra, the State contended that the overall report of the Petitioner was good but due to his indiscipline and other lack of abilities, he was not entitled to AGP at par with other professors. The High Court in exercise of Art 226 could re-assess the adverse remarks made in the confidential records of the Petitioner. Reliance was placed on State of Madhya Pradesh vs Srikant Chaphekar to buttress this contention.
Accordingly, it was held that the remarks relating to a brief period of a few months could not have had such an impact on the Petitioner's entire tenure of service such that it would disqualify him from benefitting from AGP.
 Case Title: HARSHAD D SANTOKI S/O DEVJIBHAI Versus STATE OF GUJARAT

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently awarded compensation of Rs 30.2 lakhs to a five-year-old boy disabled for life by 33,000 KV HT line laid by the Power Development Department (PDD). The liability for negligence cast upon the functionaries of the State would lie within the parameters of "strict liability" under law of Torts, the Court reiterated.
 The Minor had come in direct contact with live 33000 KV HT line passing through adjacent to his residential house. The installation was said to have been made despite objections raised by the inhabitants of the village, including the minor's father. He approached the court seeking Rs. 1.22 crores compensation. 
 The victim submitted that as a consequence of negligence shown by the respondents he suffered severe burn injuries on account of electrocution and was operated on a number of times resulting in amputation of his right hand, thumb of the left hand, finger of right foot, besides burnt injuries to the whole body. The disability was assessed by the Medical Board to the extent of 90% Permanent in nature.
 State on the other hand claimed the victim got electrocuted due to his own negligence while playing with some metallic object on his 3rd storied residential house, as confirmed by the locals of the area.
 Dealing with the matter Justice Wani noted that father of the victim had constructed 3rd storey of his residential house in close proximity of the HT line in question having been laid in the year 2012. It observed that it was incumbent and obligatory for the respondents under Jammu and Kashmir Electricity Act, 2010 read with Jammu and Kashmir Electricity Rules 1978 to have not permitted construction of 3rd storey in close proximity of HT line.
 "The said assertion of the respondents 1 to 4 is not based on any proof or documentary evidence supporting the said assertion. The said assertion is stated to be based on the version of the locals whose particulars even have not been provided in the objections" the court added.
 Expounding on the Strict Liability Principle applicable to the instant case the bench placed firm reliance on the Supreme Court judgement in Mc Mehta Vs Union of India 1987 where it was held,
 "Where an enterprise is engaged in a hazardous and inherently dangerous activity and harm is caused on anyone on account of the accident in operation of the such activity, the enterprise is strictly and absolutely liable to compensate those who get affected by the accident and such liability is not subject to any of the exceptions to the principle of strict liability under the rule contained in Rylands Vs. Fletcher".
 Finally, the Court directed the respondents to pay an amount of Rs. 30,20,000/- (with interest) to the victim by depositing the same in a Fixed Deposit Account.
 "Monthly interest that would be earned on the aforesaid amount of compensation during the period of minority of the victim petitioner shall be withdrawn by the father of the victim petitioner and spend upon victim petitioner as monthly expenses including treatment", the bench concluded.

The Delhi High Court has ruled that Rule 166 of the 
Delhi School Education Rules, 1973 which entitles 
a school to charge a student with a fine of five paise for every day for delay in payment of fees after the tenth day of the month, is not applicable to private unaided schools.
A division bench of Justice Vibhu Bakhru and Justice Amit Mahajan held that Chapter XIII of the Rules are applicable only in relation to aided schools and not to private unaided schools. Chapter XIII of the Rules is divided in three parts — Part A (144-155, fees and other charges in aided schools), Part B (157-170, fee concessions) and Part C (Pupil's Fund Advisory Committee).
Interpreting Rule 35 and Rule 167 of the rules, the court said the latter gives the school principal no discretion in the matter of striking off a student for non-payment of fee but Rule 35 gives a discretion to the school head. Rule 35 applies to private unaided schools and Rule 167 applies only to an aided school, it noted.
"Making Rule 166 or other rules falling in Part 'B' of Chapter XIII of the Rules, applicable to private institutions, thereby, mandating these institutions to compulsorily charge an amount of five paise for everyday of delay and, also requiring that the name of the student be struck off on account of non-payment of fees would be inconsistent with their right to carrying on their affairs in the manner they deem fit," said the court.
Observing that the same would fall foul of the principle of autonomy which has been recognised by the Supreme Court, the court said it cannot be accepted that Rule 167 of the Rules - which complements Rule 166 of the Rules, is not applicable to the students of private unaided schools but Rule 166 of the Rules would apply to private unaided schools. 
"The principles of statutory interpretation provides that a provision has to be read in a meaningful manner and has to be interpreted in a manner so as to save from being declared unconstitutional. It would be inherently inconsistent to suggest that the schools are free to levy the fee after taking into account the need to generate funds but will have to levy a fine for late payment at the rate of five paise per day. It is an admitted case that fee charged from students in a private unaided school is much higher than the fee charged from a student in an aided school," said the bench.
It further said that rules which from their perusal and necessary implications are applicable in relation to aided schools cannot be made applicable in relation to affairs of private unaided schools. 
"Even otherwise, Rule 166 of the Rules, which is a subject matter of dispute in the present writ petition, falls in Part 'B', which starts with Rule 157. Rule 157 of the Rules states "the expression, "Fees" includes science fee, music fee etc..", which is required to be paid by the students in an aided school. A holistic reading of Chapter XIII of the Rules leaves no doubt that the said chapter, in its entirety, is applicable in relation to fee and other charges collected by aided schools," it added. 
Delhi's Directorate of Education in 2013 had passed an order prescribing that Rule 166 should also be applicable to private unaided schools. However, it had accepted that charging five paise as late fees is illogical in present times and needs to be reviewed. A single bench of the high court in April 2013 held that Part B of Chapter XIII of the Rules, especially Rules 165 and 166, apply to all private unaided recognized schools in Delhi. 
The Action Committee Unaided Recognized Private School, an umbrella association of more than 500 private unaided schools in the national capital in 2013 sought a direction that the rules contained in Part B (fee concessions) of Chapter XIII do not apply to private unaided recognized schools. In the alternative, the plea challenged the constitutionality of the Rules.
The division bench reiterated that in the matter of charging fees, substantial autonomy is provided to the private unaided schools. 
"This is in contradistinction to the fee leviable by the aided schools, which is governed by Chapter XIII of the Rules. The private unaided schools are free to fix their fee structure, which in our opinion, not only includes the tuition fees but also other charges and contributions payable by the student," the court said.
However, the court clarified that the amount collected by the private unaided schools is governed by other provisions of the Act.
Ruling that Rule 166 is not applicable in relation to private unaided schools, the court said the DoE in 2013 had mentioned that the Committee has been set up for review of the said provision. 
"We expect that the respondent would expedite the process and make the recommendations, as expeditiously as possible, within a period of eight weeks from date," said the court.
Advocate Kamal Gupta represented the petitioner organisation. Standing Counsel Santosh Kumar Tripathi appeared for the Delhi government.

The Supreme Court reiterated that neither the client nor the court is bound by lawyer's admissions as to matters of law or legal conclusions.
"While generally admissions of fact by counsel are binding, neither the client nor the court is bound by admissions as to matters of law or legal conclusions", the bench comprising Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice AS Bopanna, observed while dealing with a case pertaining to a DACP (Dynamic Assured Career Progression) scheme contravening with the provisions of ESIC Recruitment Regulations. 
This appeal arose out of the proceedings that were instituted before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Bengaluru by respondents in the current matter who had joined as Assistant Professors at ESIC Model Hospital, Rajajinagar, Bengaluru between 7 February 2012 and 26 June 2014. Their contention was that a scheme issued by Central Government on 29 October 2008 had contemplated that an Assistant Professor was to be promoted as an Associate professor once they had completed two years in the service on the post of Assistant Professor and thus, on completion of two years in service, the respondents applied to CAT, Bengaluru seeking such promotion, in February 2017. CAT, Bengaluru held that ESIC regulations were not applicable in the matter and directed the appellant (ESIC) to consider the respondents for promotion under the DACP scheme. The appellants then challenged the order of the CAT via a writ petition in the High Court of Karnataka, which also dismissed the writ petition holding that since the ESIC Recruitment Regulations 2015 came into effect after the respondents were recruited, they would be entitled to the benefit of promotion as per the DACP scheme. High Court of Karnataka also ruled that the
In appeal, the respondents contended that the appellant is estopped from urging that the DACP Scheme is not applicable to the Teaching Cadre at the ESIC since they have taken this stance before the CAT and in its writ petition before the High Court.
The bench expressed its disapproval at the lack of proper instructions being tendered to the Counsel of the appellant, but added that there can be no estoppel against a statute or regulations having a statutory effect. The bench noted the following observation made in Himalayan Coop. Group Housing Society v. Balwan Singh (2015) 7 SCC 373:
"A lawyer generally has no implied or apparent authority to make an admission or statement which would directly surrender or conclude the substantial legal rights of the client unless such an admission or statement is clearly a proper step in accomplishing the purpose for which the lawyer was employed. We hasten to add neither the client nor the court is bound by the lawyer's statements or admissions as to matters of law or legal conclusions"
The court, in this regard, also noted a judgment in Director of Elementary Education, Odisha v. Pramod Kumar Sahoo (2019) 10 SCC 674. Therefore, the bench held that the concession of the Counsel for the appellant before the CAT does not preclude the finding on the law that is arrived at by this Court
 

The Karnataka High Court has quashed proceedings initiated last year against workers of now-banned Campus Front of India (CFI) for holding a meeting and gathering people at Dr.B.R.Ambedkar Bhavan, Bagalokot, when the authorities had prohibited such meetings on account of third wave of COVID-19.

The Karnataka High Court has quashed proceedings initiated last year against workers of now-banned Campus Front of India (CFI) for holding a meeting and gathering people at Dr.B.R.Ambedkar Bhavan, Bagalokot, when the authorities had prohibited such meetings on account of third wave of COVID-19. 
Justice J M Khazi sitting at Dharwad bench allowed the petition filed by Khadar Basha and others who were charged for offences punishable under Sections 143, 270, 448 R/W Section 149 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Sections 4 and 5 of Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance 2020. 
The prosecution alleged that all the accused persons including the petitioners, being the workers of Campus Front of India, held a meeting at Dr.B.R.Ambedkar Bhavan and gathered around 130 students from different places, though there was prohibition for such meetings on account of third wave of COVID-19 and thereby committed the offences.
However, the petitioners contended that they have been falsely implicated. There is no evidence that petitioners were the organisers of the alleged event and that anyone of them was suffering from COVID-19, the court was told.
On going through the records the bench said: “In the present case, the allegation is that at the time when the accused persons were conducting a meeting, the third wave of Covid-19 was going on and as such, there was possibility of spreading of the same. However, no evidence is collected by the Investigating Officer to show that any of the accused persons or the spectators who had gathered was suffering from Covid-19 and therefore, the offence punishable under Section 270 cannot be invoked.” 
The court also said Sections 4 of the Karnataka Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance 2020, specifies the power to take special measures and "is a not penal provision so as to constitute an offence punishable under the said Act."
“Section 5 of Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance 2020 specifies that no person shall obstruct any officer or any public servant while acting or purporting to act or discharging any duty in pursuance of any provision of this ordinance,” it added.
The court said there is no allegation that the petitioners obstructed any officer or any public servant while acting or purported to act or discharging any duty in pursuance of any provision of this Act. 
"Hence, provisions of Section 4 and 5 of Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance 2020 are also not attracted," said the court. 
The court also said that in absence of any material that the petitioners criminally trespassed into the premises in question, "the charge sheet filed for the offence punishable under Section 448 I.P.C. is also not attracted.” 
Accordingly it allowed the petition and said that already the coordinate bench has quashed the criminal proceedings against accused No.9.
 “Consequently and for the above reasons, petitioners are also entitled for quashing of the criminal proceedings initiated against them,” it said.

The Supreme Court observed that a party in whose favour a court has decreed the suit can challenge an adverse finding before the appellate court without a cross objection.
It is not necessary that a challenge to the adverse findings of the lower court needs to be made in the form of a memorandum of cross-objection, the bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah observed.
The Court also observed that it can entertain new grounds raised for the first time in an appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution if it involves a question of law which does not require adducing additional evidence.
In this case, the Trial Court dismissed a suit though it rejected the defendant's objection regarding lack of jurisdiction of the Trial Court. The High Court allowed the appeal by the plaintiff and reversed the judgment of the Trial Court. It was held that the auction conducted by Moradabad Development Authority in respect of the land in dispute is null and void. The question of jurisdiction was not considered by the High Court because he did not file a cross-objection against this finding of the Trial Court on the exercise of its jurisdiction.
Saurav Jain, the defendant- auction purchaser who purchased the suit land from the MDA, approached the Apex court in appeal. He contended that the jurisdiction of the civil court is impliedly excluded under the provisions of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act 1976. Referring to Order XLI Rule 22 of the CPC, it was contended that a party, in whose favour the civil court has decreed a suit, can raise arguments against findings without having to file a cross- objection, in the appeal.
Addressing these contentions, the bench discussed the history and scope of Order XLI Rule 22(1).
"25 It is apparent from the amended provisions of Order XLI Rule 22 CPC and the above authorities that there are two changes that were brought by the 1976 amendment. First, the scope of filing of a cross-objection was enhanced substantively to include objections against 'findings' of the lower court; second,  different forms of raising cross-objections were recognised. The amendment sought to introduce different forms of cross-objection for assailing the findings and decrees since the amendment separates the phrase "but may also state that the finding against him in the Court below in respect of any issue ought to have been in his favour" from "may also take any cross-objection to the decree" with a semi colon. Therefore, the two parts of the sentence must be read disjunctively. Only when a part of the decree has been assailed by the respondent, should a memorandum of cross-objection be filed. Otherwise, it is sufficient to raise a challenge to an adverse finding of the court of first instance before the appellate court without a cross objection."
The court then discussed the applicability of the principle in Order XLI Rule 22 CPC to proceedings before this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution
"The principle stipulated in Order XLI Rule 22 of CPC can be applied to petitions under Article 136 of the Constitution because of this Court's wide powers to do justice under Article 142 of the Constitution. Since the principle in Order XLI Rule 22 of the CPC furthers the cause of justice by providing the party other than the 'aggrieved party' to raise any adverse findings against them, this Court can draw colour from Order XLI Rule 22 CPC and permit objections to findings.", the bench observed.
The bench noted that the ground of jurisdiction was only raised by the appellant before the Trial Court and not before the High Court.  However, referring to earlier judgments, the bench said that the plea of a bar or lack of jurisdiction can be entertained at any stage, since an order or decree passed without jurisdiction is nonest in law.
Thus, considering the case on merits, the bench held that ULCRA impliedly excludes the jurisdiction of the civil court on matters arising out of the ceiling proceeding.
"Though the appellant did not assail the finding of the Trial Court on the issue of jurisdiction before the High Court under Order XLI Rule 22 CPC either by filing a memorandum of cross-objection or otherwise, he is not precluded from raising the argument before this Court. This Court in view of its plenary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution read with its power to do complete justice under Article 142, can entertain new grounds raised for the first time if it involves a question of law which does not require adducing additional evidence, specifically one concerning jurisdiction of the court which goes to the root of the matter.", the court said while disposing the appeal.

The Allahabad High Court has rejected an application filed under Section 482 of CrPC seeking to quash an order of the Additional Sessions Judge, Deoria rejecting two applications filed by the Applicant/accused under Section 311 of CrPC for recall of two prosecution witnesses.
While doing so, Justice Sanjay Kumar Pachori shed light on the applicability of Section 311 CrPC. 
"Section 311 of the Code gives a wide power to the court to summon a material witness or to examine a person present in court or to recall a witness already examined. It confers a wide discretion on the court to act as the exigencies of justice require. The word "just" cautions the court against taking any action which may result injustice either to the accused or to the prosecution," it observed.
The Bench explained that the provision can be broadly divided into two parts:
The first part of the Section has given discretion to the Court and enables it any stage of an inquiry, trial, or other proceedings under the Code, (a) to summon anyone as a witness, or (b) to examine any person in the Court, or (c) to recall and re-examine any person whose evidence has already been recorded.
The second part of the Section is mandatory and imposes an obligation on the Court, to do one of aforesaid three things if the new evidence appears to it essential to the just decision of the case.It opined that t
he discretion given by the first part is very wide and its very width requires a corresponding caution on the part of the court. But the second part does not allow any discretion; it binds the court to examine fresh evidence and the only condition prescribed is that this evidence must be essential to the just decision of the case. Whether the new evidence is essential or not must of course depend on the facts of each case and has to be determined by the presiding Judge."…Where the court exercise the power under the second part, the inquiry cannot be as to whether the accused has brought anything suddenly or unexpectedly but whether the court is right in thinking that the new evidence is needed by it for a just decision of the case. If the court has acted without the requirements of a just decision, the action is open to criticism but if the court's action is supportable as being in aid of a just decision the action cannot be regarded as exceeding the jurisdiction."
 In the instant case, the applications for recall of witnesses were filed by the Applicant/ accused about 4 years of recording the statement-in-chief of PW-1 and about one year of recording the examination-in-chief of PW-5.
Noting that the trial of the present case is pending since 2015 and that the applicant shall have an opportunity to produce oral or documentary evidence with regard to the fact in dispute as the trial is pending for defence evidence, the Court opined that trial judge gave well-founded reasons for rejecting the applications.
Reliance was placed on Natasa Singh v. CBI, (2013) 5 SCC 741, where it was stated that:
"The scope and object of the provision is to enable the Court to determine the truth and to render a just decision after discovering all relevant facts and obtaining proper proof of such facts, to arrive at a just decision of the case...An application under Section 311 of Cr.P.C. must not be allowed only to fill up a lacuna in the case of the prosecution, or of the defence."
Similarly, in Swapan Kumar Chattarjee v CBI, (2019) 14 SCC 328, it was held that,
 "Where the prosecution evidence has been closed long back and the reasons for nonexamination of the witness earlier are not satisfactory, the summoning of the witness at belated stage would cause great prejudice to the accused and should not be allowed. Similarly, the court should not encourage the filing of successive applications for recall of a witness under this provision."
 In Rajaram Prasad Yadav v. State of Bihar, (2013) 14 SCC 461, it was held as follows:
"The exercise of power under Section 311 Cr.PC. should be resorted to only with the object of finding out the truth or obtaining proper proof for such facts, which will lead to a just and correct decision of the case.
The exercise of the said power cannot be dubbed as filling in a lacuna in a prosecution case, unless the facts and circumstances of the case make it apparent that the exercise of power by the Court would result in causing serious prejudice to the accused, resulting in miscarriage of justice.
"Accordingly, stating that the applicant shall have an opportunity to produce oral or documentary evidence with regard to the fact in dispute and thus recall of witnesses is not necessary, the petition was dismissed.

Dismissing an application seeking condonation of delay filed by the Himachal Pradesh government, the High Court on Friday observed that the law has equal balance for all and though some leeway is permissible in the case of government but that cannot be construed as an absolute license to flout the law at whims.
 The application was filed alongside an appeal in terms of which the Government had assailed an award passed by a Reference court. The State attributed the delay to the time consumed in obtaining the certified copy of the award and certain other official formalities as the appeal had to be vetted by multiple authorities.
 After closely examining the record, Justice Satyen Vaidya observed that there is absolutely no explanation whatsoever for not filing the appeal, immediately when the State had received the certified copies.
 "There is no doubt that the conduct of applicants has throughout been reckless and negligent in dealing with the matters having serious repercussion. The entire approach of applicants, without any doubt, can be stated to be lackadaisical", Justice Vaidya observed.
 Observing that the condonation of delay in filing the appeal can be allowed only if the Court is satisfied that the delay has been caused by sufficient reasons and such reasons are bonafide, the court pointed that in the given facts of the case, the applicants have failed to show any cause much less sufficient cause for not filing the appeal within prescribed period of limitation.
 "The applicants took about six months for preparation and vetting of the appeals after receipt of certified copy of the award. It cannot be assumed that the applicants, who are assisted by legal experts at every stage, were not aware about the period of limitation for filing the appeals", the court recorded.
 Highlighting the rigors of Limitation Act that apply equally to all including the Government, Justice Vaidya observed that the sufficiency of a cause for condonation of delay can be assessed keeping in view the facts and circumstances of each particular case. Applicants have not been able to assign any reasons whatsoever for delay in filing the appeal specially after the certified copy of the award was obtained and undue laxity of government officials needs strongest deprecation, the court underscored.
 Rejecting the argument of the appellant that provisions of Section 5 of Limitation Act be interpreted liberally and the delay caused in filing the appeals be condoned, the court said that liberal interpretation does not mean that the party can be allowed to approach the Court at any time without showing any cause, which can be termed to be sufficient.
 Elaborating as to what can be said to be a sufficient cause, the bench found it worthwhile to record the observations of supreme court in Brahampal Alias Sammy and Another Vs. National Insurance Company, 2021, wherein SC held,
 "The concept of reasonableness dictates that, the Courts even while taking a liberal approach must weigh in the rights and obligations of both the parties. When a right has accrued in favour of one party due to gross negligence and lackadaisical attitude of the other, this Court shall refrain from exercising the aforesaid discretionary relief.”
 Accordingly, there is no merit in the applications and the same are dismissed, the bench concluded.
 Case Title: State of HP Vs Kansi Ram

The Supreme Court reiterated that it is an essential condition of an unlawful assembly that its membership must be five or more.Less than five persons can be charged under Section 149 only if the prosecution has a case that the persons before the Court and other numbering in all more than five composed an unlawful assembly, these others being persons not identified and un­armed, the...
The Supreme Court reiterated that it is an essential condition of an unlawful assembly that its membership must be five or more.
Less than five persons can be charged under Section 149 only if the prosecution has a case that the persons before the Court and other numbering in all more than five composed an unlawful assembly, these others being persons not identified and un­armed, the bench comprising Justice Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S. Oka said.
In this case, the appellants contended that the charge­ sheet was originally filed against 20 persons and all of them faced trial and 17 out of 20 accused persons were acquitted by the Trial Court. That, no further appeal/revision was preferred by the prosecution against the judgment of acquittal passed by the Trial Court against those 17 accused persons who faced trial. That, appellants are 3 out of 20 accused persons were convicted for offence under Sections 148, 325/149 and 323/149 IPC. That the prosecution has no case that there were other unnamed/unknown persons who could not be traced/charged other than the persons who faced trial. That, the conviction of the appellants under Sections 325 with the aid of Section 149 IPC is unsustainable in law.
Section 149 prescribes for vicarious or constructive criminal liability for all members of an unlawful assembly where an offence is committed by any member of such an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object. The bench, taking note of this provision, observed thus:
It may be noticed that the essential ingredients of Section 149 are that the offence must have been committed by any member of an unlawful assembly, and Section 141 makes it clear that it is only where five or more persons constituted an assembly that an unlawful assembly is born, provided, of course, the other requirements of the said section as to the common object of the persons composing that assembly are satisfied. To say in other words, it is an essential condition of an unlawful assembly that its membership must be five or more. At the same time, it may not be necessary that five or more persons necessarily be brought before the Court and convicted. Less than five persons may be charged under Section 149 if the prosecution case is that the persons before the Court and other numbering in all more than five composed an unlawful assembly, these others being persons not identified and un­armed.
Agreeing with the contention raised by the appellant, the bench observed thus:
When the other co­ accused persons faced trial and have been given benefit of doubt and have been acquitted, it would not be permissible to take the view that there must have been some other persons along with the appellant in causing injuries to the victim. In the facts and circumstances, it was as such not permissible to invoke Section 149 IPC. The appellants may be held responsible for the offence, if any, which could be shown to have been committed by them with regard to the participation of others but that was not the case of the prosecution.
Observing thus, the court allowed the appeal and set aside the conviction of appellants.

The Supreme Court has observed that a mother who remarries after the death of the biological father can decide the surname of the child and include it in her new family.
The bench comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Krishna Murari set aside an Andhra Pradesh High Court judgment which directed a mother to change the surname of her child and also to show the name of her new husband in records only as 'step father'.
The court said that such a direction is almost "cruel and mindless of how it would impact the mental health and self-esteem of the child".
In this appeal, the dispute between the mother (who remarried another man after death of first husband) and the parents of the deceased biological father of the child (grandparents) was about the surname that should be given to the child. The mother had approached the Apex Court challenging a direction issued by the Andhra Pradesh High Court (while disposing an appeal that arose from a petition under Section 10 of the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890) to restore the surname of the child. So far as the name of the father of the child is concerned, the High Court directed that wherever the records permit, the name of the natural father shall be shown and if it is otherwise impermissible, the name of the new husband of the mother shall be mentioned as step-father.
The issue raised in this case were: 
(1) Whether the mother, who is the only natural/legal guardian of the child after the death of the biological father can decide the surname of the child. Can she give him the surname of her second husband whom she remarries after the death of her first husband and can she give the child for adoption to her husband? 
(2) Whether the High Court has the power to direct the Appellant to change the surname of the child specially when such relief was never sought by the respondents in their petition before the trial Court?
The bench noticed that in the case of Githa Hariharan and Ors. vs. Reserve Bank of India and Ors, mother has been elevated to an equal position as the father, bolstering her right as a natural guardian of the minor child under Section 6 of the Hindu Minority and Adoption Act, 1956.
"Therefore, after the demise of her first husband, being the only natural guardian of the child we fail to see how the mother can be lawfully restrained from including the child in her new family and deciding the surname of the child", the court observed.
Regarding the importance of surname, the bench said:
A surname refers to the name a person shares with other members of that person's family, distinguished from that person's given name or names; a family name. Surname is not only indicative of lineage and should not be understood just in context of history, culture and lineage but more importantly the role it plays is with regard to the social reality along with a sense of being for children in their particular environment. Homogeneity of surname emerges as a mode to create, sustain and display 'family.
The court also observed that the direction of the High Court to include the name of the present husband as step-father in documents is almost cruel and mindless of how it would impact the mental health and self-esteem of the child.
"Name is important as a child derives his identity from it and a difference in name from his family would act as a constant reminder of the factum of adoption and expose the child to unnecessary questions hindering a smooth, natural relationship between him and his parents. We, therefore, see nothing unusual in Appellant mother, upon remarriage having given the child the surname of her husband or even giving the child in adoption to her husband", it said.
The court noted that during the pendency of the present petition, the present husband adopted the child by way of Registered adoption deed. Referring to Section 12 of the Hindu Adoption & Maintenance Act, 1956 and the definition given to 'adoption' in Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics,the bench observed:
"When such child takes on to be a kosher member of the adoptive family it is only logical that he takes the surname of the adoptive family and it is thus befuddling to see judicial intervention in such a matter. . While the main object of adoption in the past has been to secure the performance of one's funeral rights and to preserve the continuance of one's lineage, in recent times, the modern adoption theory aims to restore family life to a child deprived of his or her biological family", the court observed answering the issue in favour of mother.
Regarding the second issue, the bench said that, while directing for change of surname of the child, the High Court has traversed beyond pleadings and such directions are liable to be set aside on this ground. While allowing the appeal, the court said:
"To obviate any uncertainty it is reiterated that the mother being the only natural guardian of the child has the right to decide the surname of the child. She also has the right to give the child in adoption. The Court may have the power to intervene but only when a prayer specific to that effect is made and such prayer must be centered on the premise that child's interest is the primary consideration and it outweighs all other considerations. With the above observations the directions of the High Court so far as the surname of the child is concerned are set aside."

Hearing a plea filed by a runaway couple (a minor girl and a 28-year-old boy), claiming to be married and seeking protection, the Punjab & Haryana High Court last week directed the Chandigarh SSP to take over the custody of the minor girl (petitioner no. 1).
The Bench of Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi also gave the liberty to the police to take appropriate action against the 28-year-old boy (petitioner no. 2), in accordance with law as may be warranted by the facts and circumstances of the case.
The case in brief
The runaway couple had moved the Court seeking protection of their life and liberty on the averments that they performed marriage on June 16, 2021, at their friend's residence as per Hindu rites and ceremonies against the wishes of respondents No.4 to 6.
The Girl claimed her age to be about 17 years and 6 months, and the Man claimed that he is 28 years of age and they submitted that they are apprehending a threat to their life and liberty.
Their Counsel submitted that the petitioners, after performing marriage are living together, and that no action for the protection of their life and liberty had been taken by the police despite making of representation by them and thus, a direction in this regard was sought to respondents No.2 and 3 for protection of their life and liberty.
The State Counsel submitted that the Girl is less than 18 years of age falling within the definition of child under Section 2(a) of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. 
Further, submitting that the Man was not entitled to the custody of a minor girl, it was submitted that Section 9 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 provides punishment for 1 of a person who performs child marriage. 
Lastly, he argued that the life and liberty of the minor girl had to be protected by sending her to a child care institution under the care of the Child Welfare Committee.
Court's order
In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, adjourning the case to July 23, 2021, the Senior Superintendent of Police, U.T. Chandigarh was directed to take over custody of the minor girl from the Man petitioner and ordered that till further orders to the contrary, she be kept in Aashiana, Sector-15, Chandigarh.
The SSP was also directed to take appropriate action for the protection of her life and liberty from danger at the instance of respondents No.4 to 6 and the Court clarified that all the expenses for a stay of the minor girl in Aashiana, Sector-15, Chandigarh shall be borne by the U.T. Chandigarh.

Refusing anticipatory bail to a man accused of forwarding a married woman's nude video to several people, the Bombay High Court observed that prima facie his alleged misdeed would be an offence under Section 67A of the Information Technology Act.
 Section 67A prescribes the punishment for publishing or transmitting of material containing sexually explicit act. 
 Justice Bharati Dangre observed that the term 'sexually explicit' under section 67A of the IT Act wouldn't only mean the act of intercourse and may also include a nude video. Therefore, the court rejected the defence's submission that mere forwarding a nude video would not fall within the purview of 'sexually explicit' content and cited the Oxford dictionary meaning of "explicit," in support.
The Court noted that Section 67A is a species of Section 67(which punishes transmission of obscene materials)
 "The intention of the legislature in introducing Section 67, being publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form, cannot be restricted by construing the term 'sexually explicit' to only showing an activity of being indulging in sex," the Court observed.
"The submission of the learned counsel that mere forwarding a nude video would not fall within the purview of 'sexually explicit" might not be correct", the order stated.
 Justice Dangre added that the intention of the legislature was to do away exploitation of women or children or any person in electronic form by publishing or transmitting any obscene material. 
 Therefore, "the term 'sexually explicit', cannot be said to be not covering activity in respect of which the accusations are made," she added. 
 The court passed the order refusing anticipatory bail to a man booked under Section 67A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code on 13/04/2022.
 The defence had cited a coordinate bench's judgement that had relied on the Black's Law Dictionary, regarding the meaning of 'explicit.' The dictionary meaning would be "Physical sexual activity or both persons engaged in sexual relations." 
 In response Justice Dangre said, that interpretation of the term 'sexually explicit activity' may be a matter of concern after the specific video is examined. But the man's custodial interrogation was necessary. 
 "Since the depiction of a woman in a nude form would definitely attract and would amount to obscene material and this being transmitted in electronic form, in my considered opinion, the accusations definitely require custodial interrogation of the applicant and the submission of the learned counsel for the applicant that Section 67-A prima facie does not attract does not hold the water at this stage."
 The Case
 The man approached the court for pre arrest bail after the Thane police booked him in April 2022. The 44-year-old woman in her complaint said she was married with two children. The accused, her husband's friend, was also a married man. 
 However, the two became intimate and while in the relationship, the accused asked for her nude video. The woman said she shared the video on the assurance that it would be deleted and the man had assured her that he had deleted the video. However, the accused's wife and daughter confronted her with the video in 2017, when she was invited to their house. 
 The woman said she severed ties with the man after the incident. However, after three years, the accused established contact with her again, threatening her with the old video. Despite acceding to his demands, not only she but even her husband and several other people received the video.
 That's when the woman approached the police.
Case Title: Esrar Nazrul Ahemad Versus State of Maharashtra

"The Byelaws existing on the date of such declaration/publication of result and issue of certificate would be relevant for the purpose of effecting changes in the certificates".The Supreme Court has clarified that the byelaws of the Central Board of Secondary Education(CBSE) which exist as on the date of declaration of result will apply to an application seeking changes or corrections in the mark certificates.The byelaws which exist as on the date of application for correction or changes will be irrelevant for consideration of changes or corrections in...
The Supreme Court has clarified that the byelaws of the Central Board of Secondary Education(CBSE) which exist as on the date of declaration of result will apply to an application seeking changes or corrections in the mark certificates.
The byelaws which exist as on the date of application for correction or changes will be irrelevant for consideration of changes or corrections in the certificates.
A bench comprising Justices AM Khanwilkar, BR Gavai and Krishna Murari settled this position while deciding a batch of petitions challenging the CBSE byelaws on certificate corrections.
The Supreme Court noted that there was a conflict of opinion amongst the High Courts as regards the point of time which would determine the applicability of Byelaws. The CBSE has amended the byelaws from time-to-time to modify the period of limitation within which the application should be made.
The Delhi High Court took the view that the byelaws which are in force on the date of application will be relevant(Kalpana Thakur vs CBSE, 2015 SCC OnLine Del 12156)
The Kerala High Court took a different view of the matter and observed that the Byelaws existing on the date of passing out would apply(Vyshnav vs CBSE, 2017 SCC OnLine Ker 39806)
The Supreme Court observed :
"Considered in the context of the Byelaws, the controversy is actually simple in nature. The Byelaws consistently provide that the period of limitation is to be calculated from the date of declaration of the result and issue of certificate. It means that the period of limitation begins to run against the student after declaration of result and publication of certificates as the student isput to notice of the contents of the document, upon its issue. The student can now be said to be in a position to verify the correctness of the certificate(s). The irresistible outcome of this legal position is that the Byelaws existing on the date of such declaration/publication of result and issue of certificate would be relevant for the purpose of effecting changes in the certificates. The express language of the Byelaws would be defeated if we say that the law existing on the date of application for recording change would be relevant. That would negate the very importance of having a period of limitation for correction of the certificates"(Paragraph 159).
"If the limitation of applicability of Byelaws was to be reckoned from the date of application for correction/change and not the date of result of the examination conducted by CBSE, we would be leaving things to a state of uncertainty. For, a student who could possibly have surpassed the limitation period under unamended Byelaws would regain the right to change the certificates if the Byelaws existing on the date of application permit so and provide for a longer period. Similarly, a student who had ten years for carrying out changes under the unamended Byelaws would lose her right if Byelaws are amended within the ten ­year period so as to provide for a much shorter, say two years, limitation period.Certainty, consistency and predictability are the hallmarks of any legal relationship and it is in the interest of public policy that legal interpretation preserves and protects these hallmark"(Paragraph 160).
The Court has also suggested that the CBSE should have a "different approach" with regard to the limitation period, having regard to the fact that the inadvertent mistakes made by students when they are young might be noticed only later, when they require the CBSE certificates for other purposes.
"The limitation as regards maximum period upto which changes can be permitted also requires a different approach. Upon receiving the certificates, the student would naturally be put to notice of the particulars of certificates. Due to young age and inadvertence including being casual and indolent, a student may fail to identify the errors or to understand the probable impact of those errors and accordingly, may not apply for rectification immediately. It is also possible that a student may not have to use the certificates immediately after passing out and by the time she uses them, the limitation period for correction may elapse. Therefore, a realistic time for permitting corrections is very important. Indeed, it can be commensurate with the statutory or mandatory period upto which CBSE is obliged to preserve its old record"(Paragraph 125).
The Court has held the embargo in the bye-laws for name-changes post-declaration of results to be unreasonable. The Court issued a set of guidelines for recording corrections and changes in CBSE certificates, observing "name is an intrinsic element of identity".

An accused can be summoned under Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the basis of even examination ­in ­chief of the witness and the Court need not wait till his cross­ examination, the Supreme Court observed.
The bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah observed that If on the basis of the examination ­in­ chief of the witness the Court is satisfied that there is a prima facie case against the proposed accused, the Court may in exercise of powers under Section 319 CrPC array such a person as accused and summon him to face the trial.
In this case, the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh had allowed the revision application and quashed Trial Court order summoning the accused. To allow the appeal, the bench referred to the Constitutional Bench judgment in Hardeep Singh v. State of Punjab (2014) 3 SCC 92 and observed:
Considering the law laid down by this Court in Hardeep Singh (supra) and the observations and findings referred to and reproduced hereinabove, it emerges that (i) the Court can exercise the power under Section 319 CrPC even on the basis of the statement made in the examination ­in ­chief of the witness concerned and the Court need not wait till the cross­examination of such a witness and the Court need not wait for the evidence against the accused proposed to be summoned to be tested by cross examination; and (ii) a person not named in the FIR or a person though named in the FIR but has not been charge­sheeted or a person who has been discharged can be summoned under Section 319 CrPC, provided from the evidence (may be on the basis of the evidence collected in the form of statement made in the examination ­in­ chief of the witness concerned), it appears that such person can be tried along with the accused already facing trial.
The court noted that in Hardeep it was further held that even in a case where the stage of giving opportunity to the complainant to file a protest petition urging upon  the trial court to summon other persons as well who were named in FIR but not implicated in the charge­sheet has gone, in that case also, the Court is still not powerless by virtue of Section 319 CrPC and even those persons named in FIR but not implicated in chargesheet can be summoned to face the trial provided during the trial some evidence surfaces against the proposed accused.
Referring to the facts of this case, the bench observed that the Trial Court was justified in summoning the accused to face the trial as accused on the basis of the deposition of the injured eye witness. 
"As held by this Court in the aforesaid decisions, the accused can be summoned on the basis of even examination ­in­ chief of the witness and the Court need not wait till his cross­examination. If on the basis of the examination ­in­ chief of the witness the Court is satisfied that there is a prima facie case against the proposed accused, the Court may in exercise of powers under Section 319 CrPC array such a person as accused and summon him to face the trial. At this stage, it is required to be noted that right from the beginning the appellant herein – injured eye witness, who was the first informant, disclosed the names of private respondents herein and specifically named them in the FIR. But on the basis of some enquiry by the DSP they were not charge­sheeted. What will be the evidentiary value of the enquiry report submitted by the DSP is another question. It is not that the investigating officer did not find the case against the private respondents herein and therefore they were not chargesheeted. In any case, in the examination in­ chief of the appellant injured eye witness, the names of the private respondents herein are disclosed. It might be that whatever is stated in the examination ­in ­chief is the same which was stated in the FIR. The same is bound to be there and ultimately the appellant herein – injured eye witness is the first informant and he is bound to again state what was stated in the FIR, otherwise he would be accused of contradictions in the FIR and the statement before the Court. Therefore, as such, the learned Trial Court was justified in directing to issue summons against the private respondents herein to face the trial.", the bench said while allowing the appeal.

The Bombay High Court granted bail to two young men arrested for possession and consumption of drugs observing that prima facie purchasing drugs for another person at a party would not make one a drug peddler to attract the rigours of section 37 for bail under the NDPS Act.
 Justice Bharti Dangre adopted the reformative approach for the two first-time offenders and remarked that today's youth, with their "now or never" attitude, cannot foresee the consequences of their actions. 
 The two petitioners, arrested under sections 20, 21, 25 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) in June 2021, sought bail on the grounds that commercial quantity of drugs was not seized, mandatory provisions for search under sections 42 and 50 were not followed, and that the young men had learnt their lesson after spending two months in prison. 
 The prosecution argued that the first petitioner had organized the birthday party with 27 attendees at Igatpuri, Maharashtra, and the second petitioner was found in possession of 5.72 gms of cocaine and was in contact with the drug mafia. 
 The prosecution said that, "Traces of cocaine were also found in the swimming pool, and if the quantity of cocaine (once the FSL report comes) in 1 litre was multiplied with the quantity of water in the swimming pool (50k litres approximately), it would become a commercial quantity. Therefore the rigours of section 37 of the NDPS Act would apply."
 However, Justice Dangre observed that prima facie, the second petitioner's calls with the Nigerian national, seemed to be for drug consumption at the party, and he couldn't be called a 'drug peddler' by any stretch of the imagination. 
 "At this stage, there is no material to indicate that the operation was a part of a crime syndicate, where drugs are sold and purchased and that the Applicant - Harsh, who has brought the substance and offered the same to other accused present in the party, by no stretch of imagination, would assign him the role of a drug peddler," the judge observed. 
 The court felt that the two deserved a chance at reformation with a forewarning that law wouldn't spare them if they repeated their actions or were found guilty during the trial. 
 Justice Dangre found the prosecution's arguments on calculating swimming pool contraband "obscure" and "outlandish." 
 "The NDPS Act imposes deterrent sentences upon those who traffic in significant quantities of drugs and addicts, who are addicted to its consumption…The applicants are not attributed with any antecedents of being involved previously in the consumption or use of drugs …considering their young age where they are in a stage of reformation, they deserve one opportunity by restoring their freedom, nevertheless with a forewarning."
 Justice Dangre emphasized that today's youth, with their "now or never" attitude, cannot forsee the consequences of their actions. 
 "Adolescence and youth are the phases of lifetime, where making of irrational and impulsive decisions may be favoured by some. The challenge of today mainly focuses on the issue of drug addiction in youth and how to tackle it. Experimentation with alcohol and drugs is common. Unfortunately, the youths do not foresee the link between their action today and its consequences tomorrow."
 The court further observed that the menace of drugs is a reality that would require posing serious questions to get to the root of the issue. "It indeed is a harrowing reality."

The Supreme Court observed that the bar under Section 9(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act operates only when the application under Section 9(1) had not been entertained till the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal.
"Once an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted the Court cannot take up an application under Section 9 for consideration, unless the remedy under Section 17 is inefficacious. However, once an application is entertained in the sense it is taken up for consideration, and the Court has applied its mind to the Court can certainly proceed to adjudicate the application", the bench comprising Justices Indira Banerjee observed.
The court added that when an application has already been taken up by the court for consideration and is in the process of consideration or has already been considered, the question of examining whether remedy under Section 17 is efficacious or not would not arise.
In this case, the Commercial Court heard the applications filed by parties under Section 9(1) of the Arbitration Act and reserved the same for orders on 7th June, 2021. On 9th July 2021, a  three-member Arbitral Tribunal was appointed. Before the High Court, the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court to proceed with the applications was challenged. The High Court held that the Commercial Court has the power to consider whether the remedy under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act is inefficacious and pass necessary orders under Section 9 of the Act.
Section 9(1) of the Arbitration Act, enables a party to an arbitration agreement to apply to a Court for interim measures of protection before or during the arbitral proceedings, or at any time after an award is made and published, but before the Award is enforced in accordance with Section 36 of the Arbitration Act. However, sub-Section (3) of Section 9 provides that once an Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted, the Court shall not entertain such an application, unless the Court finds that circumstances exist which may not render, the remedy provided under Section 17 efficacious.
Thus, the issue in this case was whether the Court has the power to entertain an application under Section 9(1) once an Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted. If so, the true meaning and purport of the expression "entertain" in Section 9(3). The bench made the following observations in this regard:
Meaning of Expression Entertain
93. It is now well settled that the expression "entertain" means to consider by application of mind to the issues raised. The Court entertains a case when it takes a matter up for consideration. The process of consideration could continue till the pronouncement of judgment.. Once an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted the Court cannot take up an application under Section 9 for consideration, unless the remedy under Section 17 is inefficacious. However, once an application is entertained in the sense it is taken up for consideration, and the Court has applied its mind to the Court can certainly proceed to adjudicate the application
No reason why the Court should continue to take up applications for interim relief, once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted 
68. With the law as it stands today, the Arbitral Tribunal has the same power to grant interim relief as the Court and the remedy under Section 17 is as efficacious as the remedy under Section 9(1). There is, therefore, no reason why the Court should continue to take up applications for interim relief, once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted and is in seisin of the dispute between the parties, unless there is some impediment in approaching the Arbitral Tribunal, or the interim relief sought cannot expeditiously be obtained from the Arbitral Tribunal
There could be numerous reasons which render the remedy under Section 17 inefficacious.
96. Even after an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, there may be myriads of reasons why the Arbitral Tribunal may not be an efficacious alternative to Section 9(1). This could even be by reason of temporary unavailability of any one of the Arbitrators of an Arbitral Tribunal by reason of illness, travel etc.100. There could be numerous reasons which render the remedy under Section 17 inefficacious. To cite an example, the different Arbitrators constituting an Arbitral Tribunal could be located at far away places and not in a position to assemble immediately. In such a case an application for urgent interim relief may have to be entertained by the Court under Section 9(1).
Principles for grant of interim relief 
97. Applications for interim relief are inherently applications which are required to be disposed of urgently. Interim relief is granted in aid of final relief. The object is to ensure protection of the property being the subject matter of Arbitration and/or otherwise ensure that the arbitration proceedings do not become infructuous and the Arbitral Award does not become an award on paper, of no real value.98. The principles for grant of interim relief are (i) good prima facie case, (ii) balance of convenience in favour of grant of interim relief and (iii) irreparable injury or loss to the applicant for interim relief. Unless applications for interim measures are decided expeditiously, irreparable injury or prejudice may be caused to the party seeking interim relief.99. It could, therefore, never have been the legislative intent that even after an application under Section 9 is finally heard relief would have to be declined and the parties be remitted to their remedy under Section 17.
Conclusion
107. It is reiterated that Section 9(1) enables the parties to an arbitration agreement to approach the appropriate Court for interim measures before the commencement of arbitral proceedings, during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of an arbitral award but before it is enforced and in accordance with Section 36 of the Arbitration Act. The bar of Section 9(3) operates where the application under Section 9(1) had not been entertained till the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. Ofcourse it hardly need be mentioned that even if an application under Section 9 had been entertained before the constitution of the Tribunal, the Court always has the discretion to direct the parties to approach the Arbitral Tribunal, if necessary by passing a limited order of interim protection, 37 particularly when there has been a long time gap between hearings and the application has for all practical purposes, to be heard afresh, or the hearing has just commenced and is likely to consume a lot of time. In this case, the High Court has rightly directed the Commercial Court to proceed to complete the adjudication.
Case: Arcelor Mittal Nippon Steel India Ltd. vs Essar Bulk Terminal Ltd. ; CA 5700 OF 2021
Coram: Justices Indira Banerjee and JK Maheshwari
 

The Supreme Court bench comprising Justices MR Shah and CT Ravi Kumar have held that academic qualifications are a valid criteria to differentiate pay scale for different employees even when the nature of the work undertaken by them is more or less the same. 
Issue posed before the Top Court
The issue before the top court was, "Whether in a case where the educational qualifications for the post of Nursing Assistant and Staff Nurse are different, still the Nursing Assistants shall be entitled to the Nursing Allowance at par with the Staff Nurses?"
Facts of the Civil Appeal with its Judicial History in Brief
The present Civil Appeal was filed by the Union of India feeling aggrieved with the judgment passed by the High Court of Gauhati which held that the original writ petitioners are entitled to Nursing Allowance.
The respondents, in the appeal, were Nursing Assistants in various hospitals under the establishment of Border Security Force. All of them were being paid the ‘Hospital Patient Care Allowance’. According to the original writ petitioners, they were entitled to the Nursing Allowance like it was being given to the Staff Nurse. Therefore, a writ petition was filed before the High Court.
The claim of the original writ petitioners claiming Nursing Allowance at par with the Nursing Staff was opposed by the appellants contending that they were being paid the special allowance known as ‘Hospital Patient Care Allowance’ and were therefore not entitled to the Nursing Allowance at par with Staff Nurses as they are not qualified as a Staff Nurse.
Decision of the Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court 
The Single Judge, negating the objection of the appellants, observed that the duties performed by the writ petitioners are the similar duties performed by the Staff Nurses. Single Judge further also observed that educational qualification cannot be a ground for denial of Nursing Allowance. Subsequently, the Division Bench, too, dismissed the Appeal. Therefore the Appellants had moved the Supreme Court. 
Appellant’s Arguments before the SC
Ms. Madhavi Divan, ASG, who was appearing for the Appellant submitted that, “It is submitted that so far as the qualification of the Staff Nurses is concerned, it is four years course and so far as the Nursing Assistants are concerned, they have completed only one year course which is the requirement for the post of Nursing Assistants. Therefore, they shall not be entitled to claim the Nursing Allowance at par with the Staff Nurses.”
It was further submitted by Ms. Divan that, “as observed and held by this Court in a catena of decisions classification of the different pay scales is permissible based upon educational qualifications, experience and nature of duties.”
Respondent’s Reply
The Respondents argued that, "Nursing Assistants are being integral part of the nursing service and when both the Nursing Assistants as well as the Staff Nurses are integral part of the nursing service and would be performing the similar duties, the High court has not committed any error in directing to pay Nursing Allowance to the Nursing Assistants at par with the Staff Nurse."
Analysis 
'High Court has committed a serious error'
The court held, "The view taken by the High Court is contrary to the decisions of this Court in the case of Punjab State Cooperative Milk Producers Federation Limited and Another versus Balbir Kumar Walia and others, (2021) 8 SCC 784; Director of Elementary Education, Odisha and Others versus Pramod Kumar Sahoo, (2019) 10 SCC 674 and Secretary Department of Personnel Public Grievances & Pension & Anr. versus T.V.L.N. Mallikarjuna Rao, (2015) 3 SCC 653."
It is important to point out that in the above mentioned cases, the Supreme Court has upheld the different pay scales/pay structure based on different educational qualifications and has reiterated that different educational qualification and experience prescribed for appointment can be a ground to have different pay scales/pay structures.
Educational Qualification is a valid criteria 
The court therefore held, "Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions to the facts of the case on hand the view taken by the High Court that the educational qualification cannot be a ground for denial of Nursing Allowance to the Nursing Assistants is unsustainable. The Nursing Assistants in the BSF neither have relevant experience for appointment as Staff Nurse nor they possess any educational qualification for appointment as Staff Nurse. Therefore, the case of Nursing Assistants cannot be compared with that of the Staff Nurses as both carry different educational qualification." 
"In view of the above and for the reason stated above present appeal succeeds. The impugned judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court holding and directing that the original writ petitioners – Nursing Assistants shall be entitled to Nursing Allowance at par with the Staff Nurse is hereby quashed and set aside," the court added.

The Supreme Court has held that a consumer complaint is not maintainable against a power distributor for raising an additional bill on account of short-assessment.
A bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian agreed with the finding of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission that the raising of additional bill did not amount to "deficiency in service" as defined under the Consumer Protection Act.
Background facts
The consumer had earlier approached the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission against the demand. The NCDRC however dismissed the complaint, holding that there was no 'deficiency of service' on the part of the power company and that the bill was for recovery of "escaped assessment". The consumer appealed to the Supreme Court against the NCDRC order.
Raising additional demand not a "deficiency in service"
A bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian first considered the issue whether raising the additional demand will amount to "deficiency in service" within the meaning of the Consumer Protection Act.
The Court held that raising additional demand by itself will not amount to a "deficiency in service".
"The raising of an additional demand in the form of "short assessment notice", on the ground that in the bills raised during a particular period of time, the multiply factor was wrongly mentioned, cannot tantamount to deficiency in service. If a licensee discovers in the course of audit or otherwise that a consumer has been short billed, the licensee is certainly entitled to raise a demand. So long as the consumer does not dispute the correctness of the claim made by the licensee that there was short assessment, it is not open to the consumer to claim that there was any deficiency. This is why, the National Commission, in the impugned order correctly points out that it is a case of "escaped assessment" and not "deficiency in service"".
Observing as above, the bench held the dismissal of NCDRC as "perfectly in order".

The Karnataka High Court has dismissed a petition filed by a husband seeking to quash a case of dowry death registered against him under Sections 304B and 498A of IPC, after his wife, living separately since over two years, committed suicide in her parental house.
 A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna while dismissing the petition filed by one Niranjan Hegde said that the existence of seriously disputed questions of fact in the case require a "full blown trial" and hence, there is no ground to quash the proceedings at this stage. It observed,
"The contention is that it should be 'soon before death' and soon before death is required to be interpreted as 'immediately before death' and the deceased leaving matrimonial house two years ago would not mean immediately before death, are all repellable, as it is too farfetched to be considered at this juncture."
 The bench also noted that, "The case at hand is also one such, where the complainant has placed on record such material that would demand further proceedings to be continued against the petitioner and the petitioner has not placed on record any document that is so unimpeachable and of sterling quality which would entail quashing of entire proceedings at the stage of registration of FIR itself."
 As per the complaint filed by the father of the deceased the couple got married in the year 2017, the relationship between the wife and the husband did not go well immediately after marriage and they had serious compatibility issues between them. When incompatibility became inevitable, the daughter of the complainant appears to have left the matrimonial home and began to reside with her parents at Bangalore. All efforts of reconciliation which were on for over two years are said to have failed.
 On the score of irreconcilable incompatibility both the petitioner and the daughter of the complainant filed an application for divorce under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, by mutual consent, accompanied by an application for waiver of 6 months cooling off period.
 During the pendency of the said petition before the Family Court, it transpires, the Petitioner's wife committed suicide by hanging herself in the bed room of her parental house and a report of suicide was made before the jurisdictional police. On the said incident, a complaint came to be registered against the Petitioner-husband under Sections 304B, 313 and 498A of the IPC.
 Advocate Arun Govindaraj, appearing for the petitioner contended that a strained relationship between the husband and the wife for over two years has led the daughter of the complainant to leave the matrimonial house and reside in her parents' house. The family of the complainant also has a problem amongst themselves.
 The complainant argued that the investigation is still on. At this stage, what is to be looked into is only whether prima facie the complaint satisfies the ingredients of Section 304B of the IPC. Further, there are other offences alleged under Sections 313 and 498A of the IPC which are all cognizable.
 Findings:
 The bench went through the complaint and relied on judgments of the Supreme Court and said, "The complaint narrates that on the night of 12-06-2022 just before the fateful incident she was in conversation with her husband. Whether the conversation with the husband before her death has led to commission of suicide or it was collective harassment for years that has exploded in the said commission of suicide is a matter to be necessarily tried, as prima facie the complaint narrates such instances which could become ingredients of Section 304B of the IPC."
 Then it said, "The FIR is registered for offences punishable under Section 304B of the IPC along with other offences. The complaint and the narration prima-facie indicate ingredients of Section 304B of the IPC."
 Further the bench took into account the transfer of amount made by the father-in-law to the accused in his bank accounts and said, "There are documents placed now to indicate the funds being transferred from the father-in-law to the son-in-law. Therefore, prima facie, ingredients of all offences are met for registration of the crime and conduct of investigation."
 It then held, "The matter with such serious offence as could be gathered from available documents on record cannot be interjected at this juncture, as there are undoubtedly a plethora of seriously disputed questions of fact. The primary ingredient of death happening before 7 years of marriage exists in the case at hand, as the couple got married in the year 2017 and the daughter of the complainant commits suicide on 12-06-2022. What has driven the daughter to commit suicide either cruelty or demand of dowry, is to be thrashed out in a full blown trial."
 Accordingly it dismissed the petition.

The Supreme Court has issued the following guidelines on the issue of undertrial prisoners who continue to be in custody despite having been granted the benefit of bail on account of their inability to fulfill the conditions stipulated in the bail order or otherwise. 
“1)The Court which grants bail to an undertrial prisoner/convict would be required to send a soft copy of the bail order by e-mail to the prisoner through the Jail Superintendent on the same day or the next day. The Jail Superintendent would be required to enter the date of grant of bail in the e-prisons software [or any other software which is being used by the Prison Department].
2) If the accused is not released within a period of 7 days from the date of grant of bail, it would be the duty of the Superintendent of Jail to inform the Secretary, DLSA who may depute para legal volunteer or jail visiting advocate to interact with the prisoner and assist the prisoner in all ways possible for his release. 
3) NIC would make attempts to create necessary fields in the e-prison software so that the date of grant of bail and date of release are entered by the Prison Department and in case the prisoner is not released within 7 days, then an automatic email can be sent to the Secretary, DLSA. 
4) The Secretary, DLSA with a view to find out the economic condition of the accused, may take help of the Probation Officers or the Para Legal Volunteers to prepare a report on the socio-economic conditions of the inmate which may be placed before the concerned Court with a request to relax the condition (s) of bail/surety. 
5) In cases where the undertrial or convict requests that he can furnish bail bond or sureties once released, then in an appropriate case, the Court may consider granting temporary bail for a specified period to the accused so that he can furnish bail bond or sureties. 
6) If the bail bonds are not furnished within one month from the date of grant bail, the concerned Court may suo moto take up the case and consider whether the conditions of bail require modification/ relaxation. 
7) One of the reasons which delays the release of the accused/ convict is the insistence upon local surety. It is suggested that in such cases, the courts may not impose the condition of local surety.” 
The above directions are part of the detailed and comprehensive suggestions submitted to court by by the three Amici Curiae viz. Advocates Gaurav Agrawal, Liz Mathew and Devansh A. Mohta, after discussion with ASG K. M. Nataraj.
The bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Abhay S. Oka also observed in the order that the Government of India should discuss with NALSA whether it would give access to the e-prison portal on a protected basis to the Secretaries of the SLSAs and DLSAs which would facilitate better follow up with the prison authorities. ASG KM Nataraj assured the bench that granting permission wouldn't be a problem, however, he would seek instructions and get back to the court on the next date of hearing. 
During the last hearing, the court had issued detailed guidelines on disposing cases through plea bargaining, compounding of offences & Probation Of Offenders Act. The court posted the hearing to March. 
Thanking the Amicus Curiae for their hard work in assisting the court, Justice Kaul, after passing the orders said, “All of you, the Amicus, the ASG are doing more work I think to sort out this issue than could be done if the number of courts would only be hearing this issue”

While allowing a wife's plea for permanent injunction, the Madras High Court has opined that if removal of the husband from home alone is the only way to ensure domestic peace, the Family Courts should not hesitate to pass such orders.

While allowing a wife's plea for permanent injunction, the Madras High Court has opined that if removal of the husband from home alone is the only way to ensure domestic peace, the Family Courts should not hesitate to pass such orders.
 The bench of Justice RN Manjula observed,
"The protection orders are normally given to ensure the peaceful movement of a woman within her domestic sphere. When a woman fears the presence of her husband and screams, the Courts cannot be indifferent by just directing the husband that he should not harass the wife, but by allowing him to reside in the same house."
The bench added that removal of husband from the matrimonial house may be ordered irrespective of the fact whether the respondent has or has not another accommodation of his own.
"If the husband has got an alternate accommodation, it is fine that he can be asked to accommodate himself in that alternate premises. If he does not have any other accommodation, it is upto him to secure an alternate accommodation."
In the present case, the wife, an advocate by profession, had challenged the order of the Family Court which had merely directed the husband not to disturb the peaceful possession and enjoyment of the home in any manner by the petitioner and her children.
 The petitioner wife had contended that the respondent harassed her and tortured her by manhandling her and abusing her in filthy language in front of their children. She submitted that such abuse would affect the peace of mind of the children, she moved a petition for mandatory injunction when the abuse went beyond limits. However, since the Family judge had not removed the husband from the matrimonial home, he aggravated his abusive attitude. 
 The respondent, on the other hand, contended that the petitioner, even after obtaining a favorable order from the Family Court had filed the petition. He submitted that he was a supportive father and still the petitioner had dragged him to the court.
 The court noticed the attitude of the respondent and observed that the intolerance of the respondent towards the petitioner's profession was creating troubles between the parties. The respondent had a hostile attitude towards the petitioner and had failed to respect the professional commitments of the petitioner. The court noted the counter of the respondent wherein he had contended that the petitioner did not stay at home and often went outside. The court observed that such a situation would deeply affect the personal and professional life of the women.
 According to the understanding of the respondent, an ideal mother is a woman who always stays at home and does only the household chores. If a woman chooses to be independent and do something more than being a housewife and if it is not taken well by her husband, that makes her life horrible by having its repercussion over her personal, familial and professional spheres.
 Observing the doubtful mind of the respondent, the court also cited that he had attributed bias against the Family Judge be alleging that he was amenable to the influence of the petitioner. This had then invited Court's suo moto criminal contempt proceedings against the respondent.
 The court noted that in such adverse situations, the court should not compel the petitioner and her children to live under the same roof with the respondent under constant fear and insecurity. The court noted that when the conduct of the parties was not affecting the family peace, the court could have allowed them to live under the same roof. But that was not the present case. 
 It is not unusual for couple live under a same proof despite their marriage lost its charm. They may even turn east and west but still try to manage to live in the same house. So long as their conduct does not hurt the family peace, but only their personal relationship, there is no harm in allowing the parties to live in a same house until a logical end is given to their marriage.
 The court therefore opined that If the removal of the husband from home alone is the only way to ensure domestic peace, the courts need to pass such orders irrespective of the fact whether the respondent has or has not an other accommodation of his own.
 The court also noted that the Family Court had failed to consider the fact that the respondent had an alternate accommodation and passed the impugned order. The court noted that such an order was an impractical one.
 Allowing the respondent to be at the same home, but directing him that he should not disturb the other inmates of the home is something impractical. A relief for a person who fears about an impending atom bomb, would be just to remove the bomb from his/her vicinity.
 Thus, the court directed the respondent to leave the house where the petitioner and the children were residing and find an alternative accommodation within a period of two weeks failing which, the respondent shall be removed from the matrimonial home with the help of police protection. The petitioner was also given liberty to approach the family court for getting appropriate orders like police protection, in case, the respondent fails to leave the matrimonial home by himself.

The Delhi High Court has permanently restrained a total of 732 rogue websites from broadcasting and streaming the Ajay Devgn starrer movie "Bhuj: The Pride of India."
Directed by Bhuj Abhishek Dudhaiya, the film was released on August 13 last year. The movie relates to the Indo-Pak war of 1971 and has now been released on various online and OTT platforms. 
Justice Pratibha M Singh decreed a suit filed last year by Star India Private Limited and Novi Digital Entertainment Private Limited against 42 rogue websites seeking that the websites be restrained permanently from communicating the film to the public. 
On August 9 last year, the court had passed an order of interim injunction against the 42 rogue websites as set out in the plaint, restraining them from broadcasting the movie.
However, despite the interim order, the court was apprised that additional URLs and domain names were also illegally streaming the film. In this regard, the plaintiffs then filed affidavits bringing on record various other domain names and websites. 
Noting that the movie has already been released on various platforms including the OTT platforms and other online platforms, the court ordered:
"In view thereof, since the rights of the Plaintiffs are not in question, a permanent injunction is liable to be granted in terms of paragraph 66(i) of the plaint against all the rogue websites i.e., Defendant Nos. 1 to 42 and the other domain names added by subsequent affidavits totalling 689 additional websites/ domain names."
The court also directed the domain name registrars to ensure that the impugned domain names are suspended, locked and status quo is maintained in respect of the same. 
"The same shall not be permitted to be transferred to any third party. The orders of blocking shall also stand confirmed permanently in respect of all the impugned domain names / websites," the court added.

The Karnataka High Court has said that the right of a woman to exercise her reproductive choice is a dimension of "personal liberty" as understood under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and she has a sacrosanct right to have her bodily integrity protected.
 A single judge bench of Justice N S Sanjay Gowda said that, 
"The act of forcing a woman to bear with an unwanted intrusion on her body and endure the consequences of that intrusion would be a clear transgression of her inviolable fundamental right of "personal liberty" guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution."
 The Court was dealing with a case where the medical practitioner had refused to terminate the pregnancy of a 16 years old rape survivor, as it had crossed 24 weeks as set down in Section 3 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. 
The petitioner had approached the court urging that she cannot be forced to carry the burden of crime and cannot be compelled to deliver a baby which has been conceived against her will. 
The court while allowing the petition noted, 
"In cases of rape inflicted on minor girls, though there are certain statutory limitations prescribed under the 1971 Act, they would essentially be applicable only to medical practitioners. In such cases, the requirement to terminate the pregnancy medically would have to be considered and examined in an altogether different light by the Constitutional Courts."
 Referring to sections 3 (2) (a) and 3 (2) (b) of the MTP Act, which stipulates the procedure for termination of pregnancy in cases not exceeding 20 weeks and not beyond 24 weeks, the court said, 
"It is thus clear that the law creates a statutory presumption of grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman if she alleges that the pregnancy was caused due to an alleged rape."
 Noting that the Act does not provide for termination of pregnancy after 24 weeks by medical practitioners even if it is alleged by the pregnant woman to have been caused by rape, the court said, 
"It should also be kept in mind that a minor who has been raped and has become pregnant due to it, will be forced not only to be a victim of the crime but would also be compelled to bear with the burden of the crime inflicted on her by forcing her to deliver a child, the conception of which, was not due to the exercise of her reproductive choice. In fact, the fate of the child, if delivered, may also be perilous and detrimental to its own interest given the social stigma that would hover around it."
 The court went on to opine that, "the statutory limitations imposed in a statute cannot be an impediment or a restriction on the exercise of Constitutional power of the High Courts. The exercise of this constitutional power would obviously be exercised rarely, sparingly and in exceptional circumstances and would obviously rest on the facts of each case."
 Referring to Section 3 (2B) of the Act which excludes the applicability of the time of the length of pregnancies by the medical practitioner, if the termination is necessitated by the diagnosis of any substantial foetal abnormalities diagnosed by a Board, the court observed, "That the 1971 Act does not create an absolute bar for termination of pregnancies that have traversed even beyond the period of 24 weeks stipulated in Section 3(2) (b) of the Act."
 Further, it referred to section 5 of the Act and said, "The Act, in fact, allows termination of pregnancy by a medical practitioner, without reference to the length of the pregnancy or without reference to the pre-conditions requisite for conducting them, if the continuance of the pregnancy constitutes a risk to the very survival of the pregnant woman."
 Following which the court held, 
"The consequences of continuing the pregnancy on the future life of the 16 year old would be quite severe and detrimental to a dignified life as contemplated under Article 21 of the Constitution."
 The court also went through the opinion offered by the Medical Board comprised of Gynecologist, Radiologist and Psychiatrist and other doctors and said, "In my view, having regard to the circumstances explained above and the specific opinion rendered by the Medical Board, the petitioner has made out a case for issuance of a direction to terminate the pregnancy."
 Accordingly the court directed that, "The 2nd respondent (District Health Surgeon, Belgavi), to ensure the medical termination of pregnancy of the petitioner forthwith in accordance with the provisions of Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 and having regard to the opinion of the board."

Presiding deity of the temple is the owner of the land attached to the temple and Pujari is only to perform puja and to maintain the properties of the deity, the Supreme Court observed while upholding the circulars issued by the Madhya Pradesh Government to delete the names of Pujari from revenue record pertaining to temple properties.
These circulars issued by the Government under M.P. Land Revenue Code, 1959, were earlier quashed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court. In appeal, the state contended that such executive instructions were issued so  to protect the temple properties from unauthorized sale by the Pujaris. On the other hand, the Pujaris contended that they have been conferred Bhumiswami (ownership) rights and that cannot be taken away by executive instructions Thus the issue considered was whether a priest can be treated as Bhumiswami under the Revenue Code.
"The Law is clear on the distinction that the Pujari is not a Kashtkar Mourushi, i.e., tenant in cultivation or a government lessee or an ordinary tenant of the maufi lands but holds such land on behalf of the Aukaf Department for the purpose of management. The Pujari is only a grantee to manage the property of the deity and such grant can be reassumed if the Pujari fails to do the task assigned to him, i.e., to offer prayers and manage the land. He cannot be thus treated as a Bhumiswami.", the bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and AS Bopanna said referring to earlier judgments including its 'Ayodhya' judgment.
Another question considered by the court was whether the State Government by way of executive instructions can order the deletion of name of Pujari from the revenue record and/or to insert the name of a Collector as manager of the temple. In this regard the court said:
In the ownership column, the name of the deity alone is required to be mentioned, as the deity being a juristic person is the owner of the land. The occupation of the land is also by the deity which is carried out by the servant or the managers on behalf of the deity. Therefore, the name of the manager or that of the priest is not required to be mentioned in the column of occupier as well.
Allowing the appeal, the court clarified that the name of the Collector as manager cannot be recorded in respect of property vested in the deity as the Collector cannot be a manager of all temples unless it is a temple vested with the State.

A Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court has held that the provisions of compassionate appointment as contained under the UP Recruitment of Dependents of Government Servant Dying in 36 Harness Rules, 1974 are applicable upon employees of the District Rural Development Agency.

A Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court has held that the provisions of compassionate appointment as contained under the UP Recruitment of Dependents of Government Servant Dying in 36 Harness Rules, 1974 are applicable upon employees of the District Rural Development Agency.
 A Full Bench of Justices Ramesh Sinha, Chandra Dhari Singh and Manish Mathur held thus in view of paragraph 2(9) of the Government Order dated March 17, 1994, which provides that in respect of matters of employment of DRDA employees, for which there is no specific provision in the said Government Order, such employees would ordinarily be governed by provisions as are applicable upon employees of the State Government.
 "A perusal of the Government Order does make it evident that the service rules applicable upon Government servants with regard to appointment, seniority, promotion, reservation etc. have been made applicable upon employees of the DRDA," the Bench observed.
 Background
 The Full Bench was answering a reference made by a Single Bench in a writ petition challenging an order dated May 22, 2017, whereby claim for grant of compassionate appointment under the 1974 Rules was rejected on the ground that the same are inapplicable in the case of employees of the DRDA.
 The Single Judge noticed that a Division Bench in State of UP & Ors. v. Pitamber (2010) had held the DRDA to be 'State' within meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India but at the same time it was also held that the employees of DRDA do not hold any civil post either under the State or the Central Government and do not, therefore, come within purview of the definition 'government employees'.
 It was held that merely because an Association falls under the expression 'instrumentality of State' within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution, it would not make its employees come within the definition of government employees
 It is on this latter reasoning that another Division Bench in State of UP v. Ajeet Kumar Shahi rejected the claim for compassionate appointment to dependent of an employee of DRDA holding that the 1974 Rules are applicable only upon Government employees.
 Findings
 Pervasive State Control
 The Full Bench observed that the State Government has all pervasive control over the administration of the DRDA.
 For instance, the office memorandum which led to creation of DRDAs provide that they shall be controlled and governed by the State Government and it will be headed by the Collector/Deputy Commissioner in each district.
 Further, Rule 14 of the bye-laws provide that every employee of DRDA body shall be governed by Service Conduct Rules of the State Government.
 Furthermore, even though the governing body of the DRDA is the appointing authority of its employees but, the same would be subject to the directions issued by the Central or the State Government.
 Doctrine of 'Occupied Field'
 The Bench applied the doctrine of 'occupied field' to hold that the void pertaining to conditions of service of employees of the DRDA, has been filled by issuance of Government Order dated March 17, 1994.
 It noted that even though no specific service condition has been indicated in the Government Order pertaining to compassionate appointment. However, a reading of paragraph 2 (9) of the Government Order indicates that other matters which are not covered specifically with the Government Order or any other special order pertaining to employees of the DRDA would be regulated by such rules, regulations and orders which generally apply to Government servants serving with regard to affairs of the State.
 'Approbate & Reprobate'
 The Court was informed that except for the provisions of compassionate appointment, rest of the service conditions indicated in the Government Order have been implemented in the DRDAs throughout the State.
 Taking exception to this, the Full Bench opined that the principle of approbate and reprobate would be applicable in the present circumstance and the opposite parties cannot be permitted to repudiate the conditions of service which are beneficial to the employees of the DRDA while applying other similar such service conditions.
 "A reading of the aforesaid paragraph 2(9) of the Government Order makes it evident that there is no specific exclusion of compassionate appointment being granted to employees of the DRDA in terms of the 1974 Rules. On the contrary, the said provision clearly indicates that matters which are not specifically covered in the Government Order would be regulated and applicable as per the rules, regulations and orders generally applicable upon Government servants serving with regard to State affairs. As such, it is clear that compassionate appointment under the 1974 Rules would be covered under the said paragraph 2(9) of the Government Order," the order stated.
 Providing benefits of 1974 Rules to DRDA Employees would not give them status of Government Servants
 The State counsel had argued that the employees of the DRDA have already been held not to be government servants since they are not holding any civil posts under either the Central or the State Governments and, therefore, providing benefit of the 1974 Rules to employees of the DRDA would amount to giving them the status of Government servants.
 Rejecting this argument, the Full bench held,
 "By extending the benefit of 1974 Rules upon employees of the DRDA, it cannot be said by any stretch of imagination that it would confer the status of Government employees upon them. Incorporation of the said Rules by reference merely amounts to providing the benefit of a beneficial legislation. As such, extending the benefit of compassionate appointment under the 1974 Rules upon the employees of the DRDA would only have the effect of providing the said beneficial benefit and not granting them the status of Government servants."
 Ajeet Kumar Shahi (supra) Overruled
 The Full Bench also noted that the decision in State of UP v. Ajeet Kumar Shahi requires reconsideration since the same was passed in ignorance of a Government Order dated July 18, 2016 as per which- employees of the DRDA throughout the State of UP have been absorbed in the department of Rural Development of the State Government.
 "Considering the aforesaid factors, the reference has to be answered regarding applicability of the 1974 Rules upon employees of DRDA appointed or working prior to issuance of Government Order dated 18.07.2016 since the said employees after absorption already have the status of State Government employee upon whom the 1974 Rules are automatically applicable now," the Full Bench held.
 It added, "The judgment of Division Bench in Ajeet Kumar Shahi (Supra) having been passed in ignorance of Government Order dated 17.03.1994 is held not to be a good law and is, therefore, overruled."

The Delhi High Court on Friday observed that if the contraband seized falls within the provisions of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, the weight of the neutral substance would not be ignored while determining the nature of the quantity seized, whether small quantity, commercial quantity or in between.
A division bench comprising of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Amit Sharma was dealing with a plea wherein three questions were referred to it by a single judge bench concerning the issue pertaining to miniscule percentage of a narcotic substance under the Act. 
The development ensued in a bail plea filed by one Mohd. Ahsan in connection with an FIR registered against him under NDPS Act. The issue referred to larger bench was whether the weight of neutral substance can be ignored in cases of manufactured drugs with Miniscule percentage of narcotic substance in them? 
More particularly, the issue raised was whether the recovery of 110 bottles of Phensedyl New weighing 100 gms each and having a Codeine concentration of 0.17% per bottle would be considered as commercial quantity under the NDPS Act?
The questions thus raised were as follows:
- Whether in cases specifically related to manufactured drug with a miniscule percentage of a narcotic substance, the weight of the neutral substance ought to be ignored while determining the nature of the quantity seized i.e. small, commercial or in between?
- Whether Note 4 of the S.O. 1055 (E) dated 19th October, 2001 published in the Gazette of India, Extra., Pt.II, Sec3 (ii) dated 19th October 2001, as amended on 18.11.2009, should be held inapplicable to manufactured drug which contain a miniscule percentage of a narcotic drug?
- Whether Note 4 of the S.O. 1055 (E) dated 19th October, 2001 published in the Gazette of India,. Extra., Pt.II, Sec3 (ii) dated 19th October 2001, as amended on 18.11.2009, should be made applicable to cough syrups containing miniscule percentage of Codeine since it has medicinal value and is also easily available?
The notification in question stated if any manufactured drug within the meaning of sec. 2(xi)(b) of NDPS Act contains not more than 100 mg of Methyl Morphine and that if Codeine is compounded with one or more ingredients in the drug and the same has been established in therapeutic practice, it will not be a preparation within the meaning of manufactured drug and, therefore it will not to be a narcotic drug. 
"A combined reading of Rule 52A of The NDPS Rules and Entry no. 35, in the aforementioned notification, would demonstrate that the exception carved out in Entry no. 35, of the aforesaid notifications, with respect to codeine, has been further qualified by way of its inclusion under the category of "essential narcotic drug" under Section 9(1)(a)(va) of the NDPS Act 1985. In our considered opinion, Rule 52A further regulates the manner of possession and other related activities enumerated therein, with respect to substances/preparations covered under the aforesaid Entry 35," the Court said. 
Thus, the Bench concluded that if the contraband recovered in a particular case is covered by Rule 52A of the NDPS Rules, then violation of the said Rules would be punishable under the NDPS Act. 
"In that situation, Note 4 of the S.O. 1055 (E) dated 19th October, 2001 would be applicable to such substances including cough syrup," the Court added. 
It added "If the alleged contraband seized falls within the definition of "manufactured drug" under Section 2(xi) of the NDPS Act, then the entire notification including the aforesaid "Note 4" will be applicable."
Therefore, while answering the questions referred to it, the Court posted the matter before the appropriate bench for considering the question of grant of bail.
It is pertinent to note that a division bench of High Court had in January this year issued notice on a PIL challenging the two notifications stipulating that mixture of narcotic drug and seized material should be considered as a preparation 'in totality', as opposed to actual quantity of drug.
The High Court single judge bench had last year granted interim bail for 90 days to the petitioner against whom a complaint case was filed after bottles containing Codeine Phosphate, which is a manufactured drug under the NDPS Act, were recovered form him while he was traveling to Saudi Arabia in a flight.
The petitioner was handed over to the Saudi Arab Airlines Staff on their suspicion and was further handed over with his baggage to the Customs
Authorities. Accordingly, on inspection, it was found that each bottle weighed 100 grams containing Codeine concentration of 0.17% which translates to about 18.7 grams of concentrated codeine in total 110 bottles.
Petitioner's bail plea was rejected by the Special NDPS judge after observing that he was having 11,000 ml of cough syrup and therefore held that it was a commercial quantity, thereby committing an offence involving commercial quantity under the Act.
Case Title: MOHD AHSAN v. CUSTOMS

The Delhi High Court has observed that the fact that a weapon has not been recovered is no ground for not framing charges under Section 397 IPC which provides for the offence of committing robbery, or dacoity with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt to a person.

The Delhi High Court has observed that the fact that a weapon has not been recovered is no ground for not framing charges under Section 397 IPC which provides for the offence of committing robbery, or dacoity with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt to a person. 
Justice Subramonium Prasad added that the effect of non recovery of the weapon would be seen only in the trial and the same cannot be a reason for not framing charges under Section 397 IPC.
The Court was dealing with a revision petition filed by the State challenging the order passed by the District and Sessions Judge, Patiala House Courts wherein it had held that the offence under Section 397 IPC was not made out against the accused respondent and the matter was sent to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate for framing of charge under Section 392 IPC.
The accused respondent had given a disclosure statement of having committed an offence wherein he along with others had threatened some men by brandishing a pistol and asked them to give all their belongings. 
The District and Sessions Judge, Patiala House Courts, held that since the pistol was only brandished, and it was not used, the offence under Section 397 IPC was not made out against the accused.
Therefore, the question for High Court's consideration was whether when an act of robbery is committed by showing a revolver/pistol then does an offence under Section 397 is made out or not ?
Relying on a Supreme Court judgment, the Court reiterated that term 'use' would include brandishing the weapon against another person in order to overpower him or to frighten his victim within the meaning of section 397 of IPC. 
"Accordingly, the revision petition is allowed. Charges under Section 397 IPC ought to be framed against the accused. The learned District and Sessions Judge, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi, is directed to assign the case to its own Court or other Court in accordance with law," the Court ordered. 
The plea was accordingly disposed of. 
Title: STATE v. HASSAN AHMED

The Supreme Court has observed that the persons who are not named as accused in crime or the case registered by CBI based on the crime cannot be permitted to ask for quashing of the proceedings concerning some other persons (accused).

The Supreme Court has observed that the persons who are not named as accused in crime or the case registered by CBI based on the crime cannot be permitted to ask for quashing of the proceedings concerning some other persons (accused). The bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar & CT Ravikumar was considering SLP assailing Uttar Pradesh High Court's order dated January 13, 2020. While disposing of the petition the bench in Hukum Chand Garg & Anr v State of UP & Anr observed that,
 "It is not in dispute that the petitioners have not been named as accused in the said crime. If the petitioners have not been named as accused in the said crime, the question of quashing of stated FIR or the case now under investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arising from the said crime, does not arise as the petitioners will have no locus to seek such a relief." The petitioners who were not named as an accused had filed a petition for quashing of Case Crime No. 540 of 2019 registered at P.S. Hazratganj, District Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Since the petitioners had no locus the bench also said that it did not intend to examine the correctness of the relief claimed under Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code at the petitioner's instance. However, the bench granted them the liberty to take recourse to appropriate remedy, as and when they would be named by the Investigating Agency (CBI) in connection with the stated offence now under investigation by the CBI. "The Investigating Officer of CBI shall give 48 hours' advance notice to the petitioners before proceeding against the petitioners, so as to enable the petitioners to take recourse to appropriate remedy, as may be advised," Bench further said in this regard. 
In a significant judgment on the Consumer Protection Act 2019, the Supreme Court on Tuesday held that the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission(NCDRC) can direct the deposit of the entire amount or more than 50% of the amount determined by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission for conditional stay.The Court added that however to pass such an order, the NCDRC has to pass...
In a significant judgment on the Consumer Protection Act 2019, the Supreme Court on Tuesday held that the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission(NCDRC) can direct the deposit of the entire amount or more than 50% of the amount determined by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission for conditional stay.
The Court added that however to pass such an order, the NCDRC has to pass a speaking order assigning cogent reasons.
The Court also held that the condition of pre-deposit for entertaining appeal under Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act 2019 was mandatory.
A bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna laid down this dictum in a case involving the interpretation of Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act 2019, which prescribes pre-deposit for filing appeal before the NCDRC.
Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides that no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of order of the State Commission shall be entertained by the National Commission unless the appellant has deposited 50% of that amount in the manner as may be prescribed.
The question before the Court was whether the same can be said to be the minimum amount to be deposited or whether the NCDRC was precluded from directing the deposit of amount higher than 50% of the amount determined by the SCDRC.
The question framed by the Court was:  "whether the National Commission can pass an order to deposit the entire amount and/or any amount higher than the 50% of the amount in terms of the order of the State Commission while, entertaining the appeal in view of Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019". 
The bench has answered the issue in the following terms :
(I) pre-deposit of 50 per cent of amount as ordered by the State Commission under second proviso to Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 is mandatory for entertainment of an appeal by the National Commission; 
(ii) the object of the said pre-deposit condition is to avoid frivolous appeals; 
(iii) the said pre-deposit condition has no nexus with the grant of stay by the National Commission; 
(iv) while considering the stay application in staying the order passed by the State Commission, the National Commission can grant a conditional stay directing the appellant(s) to deposit the entire amount and/or any amount higher than 50 per cent of the amount in terms of the order of the State Commission; 
(v) however, at the same time, the National Commission has to assign some cogent reasons and/or pass a speaking order when the conditional stay of the order passed by the State Commission is passed subject to deposit of the entire amount and/or any amount higher than 50 per cent of the amount either as an ex parte order or after hearing both sides and considering the facts and circumstances of the case. 
(vi) Thus, the National Commission can grant a conditional stay of the order passed by the State Commission on deposit of the entire amount and/or any amount higher than 50 per cent of the amount as ordered by the State Commission in the aforesaid manner.
Background
The appeals before the Supreme Court were filed by a group of builders aggrieved by the direction of the NCDRC to deposit the entire decretal amount determined by the SCDRC for conditional stay.
Senior Advocate Siddharth Dave, appearing for the appellants, essentially argued that Section 51 imposed a statutory limit that the pre-deposit amount cannot be higher than 50% of the decretal amount.
The Supreme Court held that Section 51 does not take away the power of NCDRC to direct the deposit of the entire amount.
"...it is a condition precedent to deposit  50% of the amount before his appeal is entertained by the National Commission. However, that does not take away the jurisdiction of the National Commission to order to deposit the entire amount and or any amount higher than 50 per cent of the amount while considering the stay application to stay the order passed by the State Commission", the judgment authored by Justice MR Shah noted.
"Pre-deposit condition as per second proviso to Section 51 has no nexus with the grant of interim order of stay by the National Commission subject to deposit of the amount awarded by the State Commission", the judgment added.
The Court also noted that the precedent Shreenath Corporation and Ors. Vs. Consumer Education and Research Society and Ors., (2014) 8 SCC 657, in the context of Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act 1986, had held that it is open to the NCDRC to impose any condition for stay of the impugned order.
Since Section 19 of the 1986 Act is pari materia with Section 51 of the 2019 Act, the Court said that it was in agreement with the view expressed in Shreenath.
"We are in complete agreement with the view taken by this Court in the case of Shreenath Corporation and Ors. (supra). Therefore, it is held that National Commission can pass an order to deposit the entire amount and/or any amount higher than 50 per cent of the amount in terms of the order of the State Commission while staying the order passed by the State commission", the Court stated in the judgment. 
Accordingly, the appeals against the NCDRC orders were dismissed. 
Case Title : Manohar Infrastructure and Constructions Private Ltd versus Sanjeev Kumar Sharma and others

Invoking the principle of absolute liability, the Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Wednesday granted Rs. 10 Lakh compensation to the mother of a 13 year old who died due to electrocution.
A bench comprising Justice Wasim Sadiq Nargal observed that the rule of absolute liability does not obligate the claimant to prove negligence. Rather, on account of hazardous and dangerous nature of enterprise, the liability is fastened on the defaulter even when due and necessary care has been taken. 
"Where an enterprise is engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous activity and harm anyone on account of the 'accident in the operation of such activity, the enterprise is strictly and absolutely liable to compensate those who are affected by the accident."
The Petitioner-mother had sought compensation from the Electricity Department. She alleged that her son died due to the negligent acts attributable to the Department which failed to maintain electric wires, as provided under provisions of the Electricity Act and Rules framed thereunder.
The Department argued that it has not committed any act which would warrant payment of compensation and the Petitioner by no stretch of imagination can claim compensation as a matter of right. It was submitted that public in general was made aware and advised time and again not to come in contact with the live wires and fiddle with the electric wires but no heed was paid and as such death occurred due to negligence on part of the Petitioner's son.
Justice Nargal observed that anyone generating, transmitting, supplying or using electric energy of high voltage, which is hazardous and inherently dangerous activity is required to ensure that no such energy was transmitted or discharged unless requisite measures had been taken to prevent its uncontrolled escape, which may injure, impair or takeaway life. 
Pointing towards the FIR against officials of the Power Development Department, Medical Opinion and Post-mortem reports in the instant matter, Justice Nargal observed that it is evidently clear that the cause of death of the Petitioner's was electrocution, negligence of which is completely attributable to the officials of PDD, who had failed to take due care and caution in maintaining electric supply lines at proper height as per Rule 77 of Electricity Rules.
While rejecting the contention of the respondents that death was caused due to negligence of the child, the Court said that the same does not appear to be reasonable and is practically impossible as It was humanly not possible to fiddle with the wires placed at a height to 15ft from ground by a minor child who was 13 years of age. 
Expounding on the principles of strict liability and absolute liability, squarely applicable to the matter, Justice Nargal observed that it is not necessary for the claimant to prove negligence when the above rules are in action. The claimant would become entitled to demand compensation in such cases on account of violation of fundamental rights to life and liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, Justice Nargal underscored.

In a significant order, the Allahabad High Court has quashed the orders of the Uttar Pradesh Government recognizing or acknowledging 17 Other Backward Classes sub-castes as Scheduled Castes.

In a significant order, the Allahabad High Court has quashed the orders of the Uttar Pradesh Government recognizing or acknowledging 17 Other Backward Classes sub-castes as Scheduled Castes. The Court said that this exercise could have been undertaken only by way of parliamentary law.
"The provisions of Article 341 of the Constitution do not leave any scope for including any Caste or Group to the list of Scheduled Caste in a State provided by the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, except by law made by Parliament," the Bench of Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice J. J. Munir held.
The castes which the UP government had intended to include in the SC category were - Majhwar, Kahar, Kashyap, Kevat, Mallah, Nishad, Kumhar, Prajapati, Dheevar, Bind, Bhar, Rajbhar, Dhiman, Batham, Turha, Godia, Manjhi and Machua.
The case before the Court
Essentially, the bench was dealing with a writ plea filed by Dr. B.R. Ambedker Granthalaya Evam Jan Kalyan Samiti, Gorakhpur challenging two Government Orders issued in 2016 [21st December and 22nd December], whereby members of certain 'Other Backward Castes' were sought to be declared as Scheduled Castes. The petitioner had argued that only the Parliament of the country has the right to include any caste in the SC list as per the provision under Article 341 of the Constitution.
Additionally, another writ plea was moved by one Gorakh Prasad, challenging the subsequent Government Order issued by the State in 2019 [June 24] to the same effect.
It was argued on behalf of the petitioners that the list of Scheduled Castes was prepared by the President of India and only the Parliament has the right to make any changes to the same and that the states have no right to amend it in any way.
Court's observations
As far as the order dated 21st December 2016 was concerned, the Court noted that it did not add or introduce any caste as a Scheduled Caste to the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 issued by the President of India in the exercise of powers under Article 341 of the Constitution. 
The Court observed that the 21st December order only says that the members of the Caste Majhwar, whose Entry Number is 53 in the Scheduled Castes Order should be issued the necessary certificates after verification of their status, therefore, the Court did not find any illegality with that order.
However, with regard to the 22nd December order, the Court observed that it clearly recognized 17 Other Backward Classes as Scheduled Castes in the name of clarification. 
The Court emphasized that the order of the UP Govt recognizing 17 Castes, that were otherwise in the category of O.B.C., as Scheduled Castes in the State of Uttar Pradesh was not proper as it is impermissible for a state government to undertake such an exercise in view of the provisions of Article 341 of the Constitution.
"The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 alone can specify which castes, races or tribes or groups within castes, races or tribes, shall be regarded as Scheduled Castes under the Constitution, in relation to a particular State or a Union Territory. The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order has to be made by the President of India. Under Article 341(2), any change to the list of Scheduled Castes specified in the President's order can only be made by Parliament by law. A parliamentary law alone can include in or exclude from the list of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, as amended in 1976, a particular caste. The order to be made by the President, which has been described under Article 341 as a notification is insulated from any kind of variation by a subsequent notification, even by the President. The only variation that can be done is by a parliamentary enactment, not otherwise," the Court held.
The Court also relied upon the Judgment of the Apex Court in the case of STATE OF MAHARASHTRA vs. KESHAO VISHWANATH SONONE [CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4096 of 2020], wherein it was held that the power to include or exclude, amend or alter the Presidential Order is expressly and exclusively conferred on and vested with the Parliament and Courts cannot and should not extend jurisdiction to deal with the question as to whether a particular caste or sub-caste or group or part of a tribe is included in any one of the entries mentioned in the Presidential Order.
In this view of the matter, the orders dated December 22, 2016, and June 24, 2019, were quashed and the writ petition was allowed.

The Supreme Court has observed that once the prosecution is able to establish that a woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any demand for dowry soon before her death, the Court shall proceed on a presumption that the persons who have subjected her to cruelty with demand for dowry have caused dowry death u/s 304B of the Indian Penal Code.
The bench of Chief Justice NV Ramana, Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli was considering the criminal appeals filed by the accused persons(deceased's husband and mother in law) assailing Jharkhand High Court's judgement dated May 1, 2007 ("impugned judgement").
In the impugned judgement, the High Court had upheld the judgment of conviction dated 20th September 1999 u/s 304B and 201 r/w Section 34 IPC passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Giridih, sentencing them and Nema Mahto (deceased's father in law) to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of ten years and three years respectively on each count with both the sentences running concurrently. 
While directing the deceased's husband to surrender in Ram Sahay Mahto v. State Of Bihar Now State Of Jharkhand & Ors. and allowing the mother in law's appeal in Parvati Devi V. The State Of Bihar Now State Of Jharkhand & Ors, the bench observed that,
"Section 304B IPC read in conjunction with Section 113B of the Evidence Act leaves no manner of doubt that once the prosecution has been able to demonstrate that a woman has been subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any demand for dowry, soon before her death, the Court shall proceed on a presumption that the persons who have subjected her to cruelty or harassment in connection with the demand for dowry, have caused a dowry death within the meaning of Section 304B IPC. The said presumption is, however, rebuttable and can be dispelled on the accused being able to demonstrate through cogent evidence that all the ingredients of Section 304B IPC have not been satisfied."
Factual Background 
As per the prosecution's case, the informant (Bodhi Mahto) got his daughter (Fulwa Devi) married to Ram Sahay Mahto (appellant 1) in 1997 and within few months of marriage, Ram Sahay's mother (Parvati Devi/Appellant 3) and his father Nema Mahto started to harass her daughter by raising a demand for the sum of Rs 20,000 in case and a motorcycle. When her daughter expressed her parent's inability to satisfy their demands, she was brutally assaulted and threatened that her husband would be married off to another girl. Since Bodhi Mahto's daughter went missing from her matrimonial home, she lodged a complaint on August 13, 1997 u/s 304/201/34 IPC. On completion of the investigation, a charge-sheet was filed against all the three accused for the aforesaid offences along with Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.
Five days after lodging the FIR, a skeleton was recovered from the banks of river Barakar, at a distance of about one kilometer short of Village Sirmadih which was assumed to be that of Fulwa Devi. Charges were thereafter framed against the three accused(s) under Sections 304B/34, 201/34 IPC.
The trial court on September 20, 1999 convicted the accused(s) u/s 304B and 201 read with Section 34 IPC and sentenced them and Nema Mahto (deceased's father in law) to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of ten years and three years respectively on each count with both the sentences running concurrently.
Aggrieved, the accused(s) approached the High Court. The Jharkhand High Court on May 1, 2007 upheld the Trial Court's judgement of conviction.
The High Court agreed with the Trial Court's view that accused had miserably failed to explain the circumstances under which the deceased had vanished from her matrimonial home and had outrightly rejected the accused's defence that she was not residing with her husband and in-laws; rather, she was living with her brother-in- law. The Court had also agreed with the Trial Court turning down the plea taken by the accused that the dead body that was recovered from the banks of river Bara.
Another plea taken by the accused that the dead body recovered from the banks of river Barakar was unidentifiable, was also turned down, having regard to the fact that the accused failed to explain the circumstance in which the deceased went missing from her matrimonial home and became traceless. The conduct of the accused of failing to inform the family members or the police about the deceased going missing from her matrimonial home and failure on their part to make any effort to search her out, were also held against them. In fact, PW-4, brother of the deceased had categorically deposed that when he had gone to her matrimonial home, he found it to be locked and all the accused were absconding just after the occurrence which was a critical circumstance that was held against them. 
Aggrieved the appellants approached the Top Court.
Supreme Court's Analysis 
To examine the prosecution's case, the bench in the judgement authored by Justice Hima Kohli first referred to Section 304B IPC.
In this regards, the bench laid down the following prerequisites to be followed for convicting the accused for offence punishable u/s 304B IPC: 
(i) that the death of a woman must have been caused by burns or bodily injury or occurred otherwise than under normal circumstance;
(ii) that such a death must have occurred within a period of seven years of her marriage;
(iii) that the woman must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment at the hands of her husband, soon before her death; and
(iv) that such cruelty or harassment must have been for or related to any demand for dowry.
Referring to section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and explanation appended to Section 304B IPC, the bench said, 
"In the instant case, despite the shoddy investigation conducted by the prosecution, we are of the view that the circumstances set out in Section 304B of the IPC have been established in the light of the fact that the deceased, Fulwa Devi had gone missing from her matrimonial home within a few months of her marriage and immediately after demands of dowry were made on her and that her death had occurred under abnormal circumstances, such a death would have to be characterized as a "dowry death".
With regards to the deceased's husband, the bench said that there was sufficient evidence brought on record to inculpate him and that putting the circumstances together unerringly pointed out to his guilt in extinguishing the life of his wife within a few months of the marriage on her failing to satisfy the demands of dowry.
Refusing to interfere with the High Court's judgement, the bench said,
"In our view, the impugned judgment and order of sentence imposed on A-1 does not deserve interference and is maintained. Criminal Appeal No. 575 of 2012 filed by A-1 is accordingly dismissed. The said appellant who is presently on bail, is directed to surrender before the Trial Court/Superintendent of Jail within four weeks to undergo the remaining period of his sentence."
For the criminal appeal preferred by the deceased's mother in law, the bench opined that only certain omnibus allegations were made against her with respect to dowry demands. Allowing her appeal, the bench remarked,
"In fact, in the only direct evidence before the Court, PW-3 (informant and father of the victim) mentions that A-2 threatened to harm the deceased. In view of the above, we are of the opinion that it is necessary to interfere with the findings of the Courts below convicting A-3 (appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 574 of 2012) for the offence under Sections 304B and 201 read with Section 34, IPC. The said appeal filed by A-3 is accordingly allowed. She is directed to be released forthwith, if not required to be detained in any other case."

The Supreme Court observed that a compromise decree in respect of land which is not the subject-matter of suit but is part of the settlement between the family members does not require compulsory registration.
The bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta observed that a compromise decree entered into between the parties in respect of land which was not the subject matter of the suit is valid and a legal settlement.
In this case, the High Court dismissed a suit on the ground that the land even though being subject-matter of compromise, was not the subject-matter of the suit and therefore the decree required registration under Section 17(2)(vi) of the Registration Act. So the issue in appeal before the Apex Court was whether a compromise decree in respect of land which is not the subject-matter of suit but is part of the settlement between the family members requires compulsory registration in terms of Section 17(2)(vi) of the Registration Act.
Section 17(1) provides the list of documents of which registration is compulsory. Section 17(2) (vi)  clarifies that this compulsory registration is not applicable to any decree or order of a Court [except a decree or order expressed to be made on a compromise and comprising immovable property other than that which is the subject-matter of the suit or proceeding.
Referring to the provisions of the Act and precedents in this regard, the bench observed:
"12. An aggrieved person can seek enforcement of family settlement in a suit for declaration wherein the family members have some semblance of right in property or any pre-existing right in the property. The family members could enter into settlement during the pendency of the proceedings before the Civil Court as well. Such settlement would be binding within the members of the family. If a document is sought to be enforced which is not recognized by a decree, the provision of clause (v) of sub-section 2 of Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908 would be applicable. However, where the decree has been passed in respect of family property, clause (vi) of sub-section 2 of Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908 would be applicable. The principle is based on the fact that family settlement only declares the rights which are already possessed by the parties."
The bench further noticed that in Bhoop Singh v. Ram Singh Major, it was held that decree or order including compromise decree creating new right, title or interest in praesenti in immovable property of value of Rs.100/- or above is compulsory for registration. It was not the case any pre-existing right but right that has been created by the decree alone, the bench observed.
"17. In view of enunciation of law in Bhoop Singh's case, we find that the judgment and decree of the High Court holding that the decree requires compulsory registration is erroneous in law. The compromise was between the two brothers consequent to death of their father and no right was being created in praesenti for the first time, thus not requiring compulsory registration. Consequently, the appeal is allowed and the suit is decreed.", the court said while allowing the appeal.
Read Judgment

Deploring an 'executing court' for its insensitive approach, the Punjab and Haryana High Court recently observed that the working of our judicial system is painfully slow and sluggish, which creates frustration amongst the people seeking justice.
The bench of Justice H. S. Madaan was essentially dealing with a case involving a civil dispute, wherein despite obtaining a decree in its favor in the year 2014, the plaintiffs/decree-holders could not get possession of the encroached portion.
The court noted that the defendant in the matter, having lost the litigation in the trial Court as well as in First Appellate Court could successfully stretch the proceedings getting one adjournment after the other on one pretext or the other.
The case in brief
Essentially, the Plaintiffs filed a civil suit against the defendants (4 in number) seeking possession of land situated in District Hisar (Haryana) said to be in illegal possession of the defendants. After hearing arguments of both sides, Civil Judge (Jr.Divn.), Hansi, vide judgment and decree dated 3.7.2014, allowed the claim of the plaintiffs.
Resultantly, the suit filed by the plaintiffs against the defendants was decreed and plaintiffs were found entitled to get possession of the suit land from the defendants. The defendants preferred an appeal before the Court of District Judge, Hisar, which dismissed the same in May 2018.
Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed an execution petition, which kept on getting adjourned as the defendants did not appear in the matter, and therefore, after two years, in August 2022, an ex-parte order was passed in favor of the plaintiffs. Thereafter, an application was filed on behalf of the Judgment Debtors for not handing over the possession of suit land to the decree-holders.
Meanwhile, a revision plea was filed by defendant no. 1 before the HC seeking the setting aside of an order dated 8.8.2022 vide which an ex-parte order was granted in favor of the plaintiffs.
High Court's observations
Taking into account the fact that an execution petition was filed about two years earlier but to date, the possession of the encroached portion could not be got delivered to the decree-holders, the Court remarked thus:
".. (it) speaks volumes for working of our judicial system, which is painfully slow and sluggish creating frustration amongst the people seeking justice. JDs having lost the litigation in the trial Court as well as in First Appellate Court with no stay order being there in their favour have successfully stretched the proceedings getting one adjournment after the other on one pretext or the other and the Executing Court seems to be granting liberal adjournment without being sensitive to the plight of the decree-holders, who are waiting for justice for long more than 10 years. The Executing Court needs to take strong and stringent action in the matter so as to ensure that warrants of possession are executed rather than passing orders in a mechanical manner that warrants of possession had been received back unexecuted, fresh be issued for the next date of hearing. That rather shows the insensitive approach of the Executing Court."
Consequently, finding no merit in the civil revision petition, the same was dismissed with the hope that the Executing Court would realize its responsibility and get the decree executed at the earliest.

In a survey conducted on the virtual court hearings, a majority of participating Supreme Court lawyers expressed the need to replace the Vidyo App with a more effective one, such as Cisco Webex.

In a survey conducted on the virtual court hearings, a majority of participating Supreme Court lawyers expressed the need to replace the Vidyo App with a more effective one, such as Cisco Webex.
 The Advocates said that they were routinely either unable to log in or were automatically logged out during Court proceedings. Further, the Vidyo App did not offer an effective screen sharing feature due to which, they were precluded from showing certain documents or Judgments to the Bench, which could ordinarily have been handed across in Court.
 Participants also felt that there ought to be a viewing room for Advocates or litigants who just wished to observe Court proceedings, without participating in them.
 Thus, 159 of the 210 Advocates who had taken part in hearings through Video Conferencing before the Supreme Court, suggested that the Supreme Court should migrate to a different software application for conducting hearings through Video Conferencing.
 The Survey was conducted by five Advocates on Record at the Supreme Court namely, Bhabna Das, D. Abhinav Rao, Harsh Parashar, Krishna Dev J. and RV Yogesh, with an aim to find ways and means to improve the digital systems in place at present.
 A total of 227 Advocates participated in the survey, including 13 Senior Advocates, 133 Advocates-on-Record and 81 Advocates, including 8 Advocates representing their Law Firms.
 Due to the technical issues with VIDYO App, 155 of 218 Advocates strongly felt that the Supreme Court should migrate to a different software application.
 "Cisco Webex, which is being successfully used inter alia by the Delhi High Court and NCLAT was the most popular choice amongst Advocates," the report highlighted.
 Another concern expressed by most participants was that only a single person was responsible for co-ordinating the entire link sharing exercise, which lead to him being overburdened and unavailable to address grievances.
 "There is absolutely no clarity on who is to be contacted in case of any technical issue in connecting via the link shared," many Advocates stated.
 They suggested that the Supreme Court should have separate designated officers for each Virtual Court, who would be constantly available over the phone to respond to any technical queries and assist with problems which arose during a virtual hearing.
 E-FILING 
 79.3% out of 213 Advocates had availed the E-filing facility of Supreme Court. While most of them (98 out of 166) preferred E-filing to Physical Filing, a significant portion [41%] of Advocates had faced some problems with the E-filing mechanism. 
 8 Advocates stated that they had been unable to use it because of technical issues.
 Participants also gave feedback that they found the defect curing system for E-filing to be "tedious", and that most clerks struggled with the same. They expressed concerns regarding filing of voluminous petitions, as the process of uploading the petition and the printing of the same by the Registry caused a lot of delay
 As per the report,
 "By and large, Advocates feel that the interface is not user friendly, unnecessarily requires filling in of too many details at the Advocates' end, and that the support from the Registry is inadequate. Advocates are also anxious about the Diary Numbers not being generated immediately on E-filing, unlike a physical filing."
 MENTIONING & LISTING
 41.8% of the participating Advocates were able to get their matters listed "only after filing a Mentioning Application indicating some urgency".
 Further, where Mentioning Applications were rejected, no reasons were furnished for the same, leading to lack of clarity as to when the matter is likely to be listed.
 "There has been a significant delay of 10 days or more in listing of the cases of a large proportion of participants i.e. 34%. On some occasions, this delay has been caused despite filing a Mentioning Application, which has remained pending for several days," the report indicated.

The Supreme Court observed that criminal proceedings arising out of Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities Act), 1989 can be quashed invoking powers under Article 142 of Constitution or Section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code.
The mere fact that the offence is covered under a 'special statute' would not refrain this Court or the High Court, from exercising their respective powers under Article 142 of the Constitution or Section 482 CrPC, a three judges bench headed by CJI NV Ramana observed.
Such quashing powers, according to the court, can be invoked in these two situations:
(1) Where it appears to the Court that the offence in question, although covered under the SC/ST Act, is primarily private or civil in nature, or where the alleged offence has not been committed on account of the caste of the victim, or where the continuation of the legal proceedings would be an abuse of the process of law, the Court can exercise its powers to quash the proceedings.
(2) When considering a prayer for quashing on the basis of a compromise/settlement, if the Court is satisfied that the underlying objective of the Act would not be contravened or diminished even if the felony in question goes unpunished.
The bench, also comprising Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, clarified that if there is even a hint of compulsion or force, no relief can be given to the accused party.
In this case, the appellants were convicted under SC-ST Act. Before the Apex Court, it was submitted that the matter had been settled between the parties, and the Complainant had filed an application for compromise.They prayed for invocation of Court's powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to quash the criminal proceedings. 
The state opposed this prayer and therefore the court considered these issues: First, whether the jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution can be invoked for quashing of criminal proceedings arising out of a 'non­compoundable offence? If yes, then whether the power to quash proceedings can be extended to offences arising out of special statutes such as the SC/ST Act?
On the first issue, the court referred to its recent judgment in Ramgopal & Anr v.  State of Madhya Pradesh LL 2021 SC 516 and observed that Article 142 can be invoked to quash a criminal proceeding on the basis of a voluntary compromise between the complainant/victim and the accused. The court, however, added:
"13. We, however, put a further caveat that the powers under Article 142 or under Section 482 Cr.P.C., are exercisable in post-­conviction matters only where an appeal is pending before one or the other Judicial forum. This is on the premise that an order of conviction does not attain finality till the accused has exhausted his/her legal remedies and the finality is sub ­judice before an appellate court. The pendency of legal proceedings, be that may before the final Court, is sine ­qua ­non to involve the superior court's plenary powers to do complete justice. Conversely, where a settlement has ensued post the attainment of all legal remedies, the annulment of proceedings on the basis of a compromise would be impermissible. Such an embargo is necessitated to prevent the accused from gaining an indefinite leverage, for such a settlement/compromise will always be loaded with lurking suspicion about its bona fide. We have already clarified that the purpose of these extra­ordinary powers is not to incentivise any hollow­hearted agreements between the accused and the victim but to do complete justice by effecting genuine settlement(s)."
Regarding the second question, the court made the following observations:
Court can altogether ignore the statutory provisions or other express prohibitions in law.
14.. Even though the powers of this Court under Article 142 are wide and far­reaching, the same cannot be exercised in a vacuum. True it is that ordinary statutes or any restrictions contained therein, cannot be constructed as a limitation on the Court's power to do "complete justice". However, this is not to say that this Court can altogether ignore the statutory provisions or other express prohibitions in law. In fact, the Court is obligated to take note of the relevant laws and will have to regulate the use of its power and discretion accordingly
The Courts have to be mindful of the fact that the SC-ST Act has been enacted keeping in view the express constitutional safeguards 
15. Ordinarily, when dealing with offences arising out of special statutes such as the SC/ST Act, the Court will be extremely circumspect in its approach. The SC/ST Act has been specifically enacted to deter acts of indignity, humiliation and harassment against members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Act is also a recognition of the depressing reality that despite undertaking several measures, the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes continue to be subjected to various atrocities at the hands of upper­castes. The Courts have to be mindful of the fact that the Act has been enacted keeping in view the express constitutional safeguards enumerated in Articles 15, 17 and 21 of the Constitution, with a twin­fold objective of protecting the members of these vulnerable communities as well as to provide relief and rehabilitation to the victims of caste­based atrocities.
Mere fact that the offence is covered under a 'special statute' would not refrain this Court or the High Court
16. On the other hand, where it appears to the Court that the offence in question, although covered under the SC/ST Act, is primarily private or civil in nature, or where the alleged offence has not been committed on account of the caste of the victim, or where the continuation of the legal proceedings would be an abuse of the process of law, the Court can exercise its powers to quash the proceedings. On similar lines, when considering a prayer for quashing on the basis of a compromise/settlement, if the Court is satisfied that the underlying objective of the Act would not be contravened or diminished even if the felony in question goes unpunished, the mere fact that the offence is covered under a 'special statute' would not refrain this Court or the High Court, from exercising their respective powers under Article 142 of the Constitution or Section 482 Cr.P.C.
18. We may hasten to add that in cases such as the present, the Courts ought to be even more vigilant to ensure that the complainant victim has entered into the compromise on the volition of his/her free will and not on account of any duress. It cannot be understated that since members of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe belong to the weaker sections of our country, they are more prone to acts of coercion, and therefore ought to be accorded a higher level of protection. If the Courts find even a hint of compulsion or force, no relief can be given to the accused party. What factors the Courts should consider, would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case
The Court, the quashed the proceedings in the instant case for the following reasons:
Firstly, the very purpose behind Section 3(1)(x) of the SC/ST is to deter caste­ based insults and intimidations when they are used with Page | 12 the intention of demeaning a victim on account of he/she belonging to the Scheduled Caste/ Scheduled Tribe community. In the present case, the record manifests that there was an undeniable pre­existing civil dispute between the parties. The case of the Appellant, from the very beginning, has been that the alleged abuses were uttered solely on account of frustration and anger over the pending dispute. Thus, the genesis of the deprecated incident was the afore­stated civil/property dispute. Considering this aspect, we are of the opinion that it would not be incorrect to categorise the occurrence as one being overarchingly private in nature, having only subtle undertones of criminality, even though the provisions of a special statute have been attracted in the present case.Secondly, the offence in question, for which the Appellant has been convicted, does not appear to exhibit his mental depravity. The aim of the SC/ST Act is to protect members of the downtrodden classes from atrocious acts of the upper strata of the society. It appears to us that although the Appellant may not belong to the same caste as the Complainant, he too belongs to the relatively weaker/backward section of the society and is certainly not in any better economic or social position when compared to the victim. Despite the rampant prevalence of segregation in Indian villages whereby members of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe community are forced to restrict their quartes only to certain areas, it is seen that in the present case, the Appellant and the Complainant lived in adjoining houses. Therefore, keeping in mind the socio­economic status of the Appellant, we are of the opinion that the overriding objective of the SC/ST Act would not be overwhelmed if the present proceedings are quashed. Thirdly, the incident occurred way back in the year 1994. Nothing on record indicates that either before or after the purported compromise, any untoward incident had transpired between the parties. The State Counsel has also not brought to our attention any other occurrence that would lead us to believe that the Appellant is either a repeat offender or is unremorseful about what transpired.Fourthly, the Complainant has, on her own free will, without any compulsion, entered into a compromise and wishes to drop the present criminal proceedings against the accused.Fifthly, given the nature of the offence, it is immaterial that the trial against the Appellant had been concluded. Sixthly, the Appellant and the Complainant parties are residents of the same village and live in very close proximity to each other. We have no reason to doubt that the parties themselves have voluntarily settled their differences. Therefore, in order to avoid the revival of healed wounds, and to advance peace and harmony, it will be prudent to effectuate the present settlement.

The Supreme Court reiterated that, at Section 482 CrPC stage, a High Court is not required to appreciate the evidence to find out whether the accused is likely to be convicted or not.
In this case, the High Court had quashed a murder case against one of the accused. The wife of the deceased thus approached the Apex Court contending that there is ample material against the accused.
According to the complaint, one of the accused (not the appellant) had offered the couple a 'Prasadam' from Shirdi Sai Baba Temple. Since the powder was bitter in taste, the wife spitted it out, however, her husband had consumed it; that her husband fainted and fell down and ultimately died. The accused along with the appellant were charged under Sections 326, 307, 302, 420, r/w 34 IPC. Before the Apex Court, it was contended that that the allegations of giving poison and even purchasing of poison is against the main accused only; that there is no evidence that at the time when the main-accused gave poison to the deceased, the appellant was present there.
While allowing the appeal, the bench referred to the observation made in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Deepak, (2019) 13 SCC 62:
"it is observed and held that at the stage of framing of charges, the Court has to consider the material only with a view to find out if there is a ground for "presuming" that the accused had committed the offence. It is observed and held that at that stage, the High Court is required to evaluate the material and documents on record with a view to finding out if the facts emerging therefrom, take at their face value, disclose the existence of all the ingredients constituting the alleged offence or offences. It is further observed and held that at this stage the High Court is not required to appreciate the evidence on record and consider the allegations on merits and to find out on the basis of the evidence recorded the accused chargesheeted or against whom the charge is framed is likely to be convicted or not."
The court observed that quashing the chargesheet against the accused is not justified and that the court ignored what has emerged during the course of investigation.
"The High Court has entered into the appreciation of the evidence and considered whether on the basis of the evidence, the accused is likely to be convicted or not, which as such is not permissible at all at this stage while considering the application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The High Court was not as such conducting the trial and/or was not exercising the jurisdiction as an appellate court against the order of conviction or acquittal. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court ought not to have quashed the chargesheet qua respondent no.1 herein – original accused no.2.", the court added.
 

The Kerala High Court has ruled that a marriage between Muslims under personal law is not excluded from the sweep of the POCSO Act.
Justice Bechu Kurain Thomas said if one of the parties to the marriage is a minor, irrespective of the validity or otherwise of the marriage, offences under the POCSO Act will apply.
The court disagreed with the view taken by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Javed v. State of Haryana ( (PH) 276); by Delhi High Court in Fija and Another v. State Govt. of NCT of Delhi and Others ( (Del) 793) and by Karnataka High Court in Mohammad Waseem Ahamad v. State ( (Kar) 436).
"With respect to the learned Judges, I am unable to agree to the proposition laid down in those decisions that an offence under the POCSO Act will not get attracted against a Muslim marrying a minor," Justice Thomas said.
Muslim Marriages Not Excluded From POCSO Act, Physical Relationship With Minor An Offence Irrespective Of Validity Of Marriage: Kerala High Courthttps://t.co/o3s4BQLVpS pic.twitter.com/6m6uyf80VB— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) November 20, 2022
The court made the observations in its order on the bail application moved by a 31-year-old Muslim man who is accused of kidnapping and raping a minor. His claim was that he had validly married the girl in March 2021 under the personal laws applicable to them. The accused was earlier booked under sections 366, 376(2) (m) and 376(3) of the Indian Penal Code and under sections 5(j)((ii), 5(i) and section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 by Thiruvalla Police Station.
 The allegation against him is that he had abducted the minor, who is a native of West Bengal and "committed repeated penetrative sexual assaults during the period before 31.08.2022, due to which the victim became pregnant and thereby, the accused committed the offences alleged." The FIR was registered on the intimation received from a doctor of a health centre where the victim had gone for a checkup on her pregnancy.
The counsel representing the accused in bail proceedings argued that since Mohammedan law permits marriage of girls below 18 years and such marriages being legally valid, he cannot even be prosecuted for the offence of rape or those under the POCSO Act. The State argued that POCSO Act will prevail over the Mohammedan law.
Justice Thomas said that the The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, statutorily recognizes that in all questions relating to marriage, the rule of decision shall be the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat).
"However, after the coming into force of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, it is questionable whether the said personal law will prevail over the special statute relating to marriages. Under section 3 of the said Act, a child marriage shall be voidable at the option of the contracting party, who is a child. But section 12 makes a child marriage void in certain circumstances," said the bench.
The court said the investigating officer in the case has alleged that the victim was enticed by the accused without the knowledge of her parents and the age of the victim being only just above 14 years at the time of the alleged marriage, the existence of a valid marriage, even according to Muslim Personal Law, is debatable. 
"However, the petitioner is arrested for the offences under the POCSO Act as well as the IPC. The POCSO Act is a special statute enacted specifically for the protection of children from sexual offences. Sexual exploitation of every nature against a child is treated as an offence. Marriage is not excluded from the sweep of the statute," ruled the court.
It further said it is trite law that when the provisions of a statute are repugnant to, or contrary to the customary law or personal law, in the absence of any specific exclusion of the said customary or personal law from the statutory provisions, the statute will prevail, and the personal law or the customary law shall stand abrogated to the extent of the inconsistency.
"On an appreciation of the above principles, it can prima facie be held, for the purpose of this bail application, that the very marriage allegedly entered into between the petitioner and the victim cannot be relied upon as a legally valid marriage," said the court.
Remarking on the characteristics of the POCSO Act, the Court said:
"POCSO Act is a special enactment. The advances and progress achieved in societal thinking have resulted in the enactment. This special statute was enacted based on principles arising out of jurisprudence relating to child abuse. The child abuse jurisprudence evolved out of the need to protect the vulnerable, the gullible and the innocent child. The legislative intent to protect the child from sexual predators hovering over them under different labels, including that of marriage, is explicitly evident from the statutory provisions. Child marriages have been regarded as a human right violation. A child marriage compromises the growth of the child to her full potential. It is the bane of society. The legislative intent reflected through the POCSO Act is to prohibit physical relationships with a child, even under the cover of marriage. This is the intent of society, too, for a statute is, as is often said, the expression or reflection of the will of the people". 
The Court also said that Section 42A of the POCSO Act categorically stipulates that in the event of any inconsistency with provisions of any other law, the POCSO Act would prevail. 
"Personal Laws and customary laws are both laws. Section 42A intends to override such laws also. Therefore it cannot be gainsaid that after the coming into force of the POCSO Act, penetrative sexual intercourse with a child, even if it is under the guise of marriage, is an offence"
The Court refused to accept the argument that the victim had the intellectual ability to give consent and was under no compulsion or any sexual exploitation to attract the POSCO Act.
"In this context, it is appropriate to mention the decision in Sri. Aleem Pasha v. The State of Karnataka (Crl. R.P No. 7295/2022). In the said judgment, the Karnataka High Court granted bail to an accused who had married a 17-year-old Muslim girl and was booked for the offences under the POCSO Act. A reading of the above judgment reveals that the learned Single Judge had observed that the POCSO Act will prevail over the personal law. However, on the facts of the said case, the court felt it appropriate to grant bail, especially considering the age of the victim, which was more than 17 years." 
Dismissing the bail plea of the accused, the court said the victim was brought to Kerala from West Bengal and that too allegedly behind the back of her parents.
"This Court cannot be oblivious to the above circumstances. The investigation is also stated to be still continuing. Reckoning the aforesaid circumstances, I am of the view that this is not a fit case where the petitioner can be released on bail at this juncture," it said.
Case Title: Khaledur Rahman v. State of Kerala & Anr. 

The Allahabad High Court recently observed that the employees of a private educational institution do not have the right to invoke the writ powers of the High Court in respect of matters relating to service where they are not governed or controlled by the statutory provisions.
 The bench of Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Subhash Vidyarthi observed thus while denying relief to the petitioner, one Devesh Verma, who was removed from the post of Lecturer in Christ Church College, Lucknow in July 1992 after he misbehaved with the college principal.
 The petitioner had moved an intra-court appeal before the division bench after his plea was dismissed by Single Judge in September 2017
 Relying upon Apex Court’s ruling in the case of St. Mary's Educational institute vs Rajendra Prasad Bhargava  (SC) 708, the division bench upheld the order of the single judge, passed in September 2017.
 The Division bench agreed with the view taken by the single judge that a Writ Petition filed by a former teacher against the private unaided minority institution challenging the order of his termination and seeking restitution of his service, is not maintainable.
 The case in brief
 The Petitioner/appellant had filed the Writ Petition pleading that he was appointed as a Lecturer in Physics in the Christ Church College and he had joined his duties on October 7, 1991. 
 On March 31, 1992, the Principal of the College lodged an FIR under Sections 504/506 of the Indian Penal Code against him and he was arrested on July 16, 1992. 
 Though he was granted bail the same day, he was not allowed to resume his duties at the College. 
 Ultimately, in May 1996, he got acquitted in the case and after that, when he went to resume his duties at the College, he was told that another person had been appointed in his place and his services had come to an end automatically with effect from July 17, 1992, a day after his arrest. 
 Challenging the said oral termination of his services on the ground that before dispensing with his services, no approval was obtained under Section 16 G (3) of the U. P. Intermediate Education Act, 1921 the appellant/petitioner moved the Single Judge.
 The Single judge dismissed his plea on the ground that Section 16 G (3) of the 1921 Act are not applicable to minority institutions. The Single judge also observed that the writ petition filed against a private minority institution is not maintainable.
 Challenging the single judge’s order, the appellant moved the instant plea arguing that since the College is engaged in imparting education to the children, which is a public duty, therefore, the writ petition filed against such an institution would be maintainable.
 Court’s observations
 At the outset, the Court took into account the Apex Court’s ruling in the case of St. Mary's Educational Institute (supra), wherein it was categorically laid down that “while a body may be discharging a public function or performing a public duty and thus its actions becoming amenable to judicial review by a Constitutional Court, its employees would not have the right to invoke the powers of the High Court conferred by Article 226 in respect of matter relating to service where they are not governed or controlled by the statutory provisions.
 In this case, it was further held by the Top Court that the actions or decisions taken solely within the confines of an ordinary contract of service, having no statutory force or backing, cannot be recognized as being amenable to challenge under Article 226 of the Constitution.
 Further, taking note of the facts of the case, the Court said that the Writ Petition would not maintainable for one more reason that there are several disputed questions of fact involved in the case. 
 “Whether or not the appellant was duly selected and appointed, and what were his service conditions, are facts which are in dispute and regarding which no material is available on record. For this reason, also, the Writ Petition would not be maintainable,” the Court said.
 Against this backdrop, the Division bench dismissed the Special Appeal while agreeing with the view taken by the single judge in its 2017 order.

The Supreme Court reiterated that a criminal complaint has to be quashed if if no offence is made out by a careful reading of the complaint.
When the complaint itself disclosed nothing more than a commercial relationship which broke, it is not possible to enlarge the scope of his complaint by merely adding the language used in the text of the Indian Penal Code, the bench comprising Justices Indira Banerjee and V. Ramasubramanian observed.
In this case, the complainant filed a private complaint under Section 200 Cr.P.C, which was referred by the Court under Section 156(3) CrPC to the police which registered FIR under Sections 406, 420, 408, 460, 471, 384, 311, 193, 196 read with Section 120­B IPC. The accused approached the High Court for quashing FIR by filing a petition under Section 482 CrPC which was dismissed.
Before the Apex Court bench, it was contended (i) that the complaint filed does not disclose the commission of any offence; (ii) that the complaint was only a counter blast to the civil suit filed by appellant No.1 and a criminal complaint lodged by the appellants against respondent No.2; (iii) that the High Court overlooked the pendency of an application for bringing on record the charge­sheet and for the inclusion of a prayer for quashing of the charge­sheet.
Perusing the complaint, the bench observed:
"A careful reading of the complaint, the gist of which we have extracted above would show that none of the ingredients of any of the offences complained against the appellants are made out. Even if all the averments contained in the complaint are taken to be true, they do not make out any of the offences alleged against the appellants. Therefore, we do not know how an FIR was registered and a charge­sheet was also filed."
The court added that when the complaint itself disclosed nothing more than a commercial relationship which broke, it is not possible to enlarge the scope of his complaint by merely adding the language used in the text of the Indian Penal Code.
"The High Court was clearly in error in overlooking the application for bringing on record the subsequent development of the filing of the charge­sheet and the prayer for inclusion of the relief of quashing of the charge­sheet in the original petition.. It is too late in the day to seek support from any precedents, for the proposition that if no offence is made out by a careful reading of the complaint, the complaint deserves to be quashed.", the bench observed while allowing the appeal.

In a notable judgment explaining the concept of 'cause of action' under Article 226(2) of the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court held that only those facts, which are relevant to the grant of the relief, will give rise to 'cause of action'. 
Applying this principle, the Court held that a company cannot challenge a GST notification issued by one state before a High Court located in another State only on the ground that it has office there.
The Supreme Court was considering the appeals filed by the State of Goa against a decision of the Sikkim High Court that it has jurisdiction to entertain a petition filed by a company challenging the notification issued by the Goa Government. The writ petition was filed by a lottery company challenging a notification issued by the Goa Government under the GST Act.
The petitioner claimed that a part of the cause of action had arisen in Sikkim and hence the Sikkim High Court has jurisdiction to decide the matter. The High Court held the writ petitions as maintainable on the ground that the petitioners are also challenging a notification issued by the Centre under the CGST Act. Although State of Goa filed an application for its deletion from the array of respondents, the High Court refused to do so, against which the State appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court noted that there is no pleading in the writ petition as to how the cause of action has arisen in Sikkim, except a statement that both the petitioners and the respondents are located within the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court.
In this context, the Court delved into the meaning of the word "cause of action" and referred to the classic definition in Cooke vs. Gill -"cause of action means every fact which it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right to the judgment of the court".
Guiding tests to determine cause of action
The Court said that in the context of a writ petition, what would constitute such ‘cause of action’ is the material facts which are imperative for the writ petitioner to plead and prove to obtain relief as claimed. Such pleaded facts must have a nexus with the subject matter of challenge based on which the prayer can be granted. Those facts which are not relevant or germane for grant of the prayer would not give rise to a cause of action conferring jurisdiction on the court.
Here, tax has been levied by the Government of Goa in respect of a business that the petitioning company is carrying on within the territory of Goa. Such tax is payable by the petitioning company not in respect of carrying on of any business in the territory of Sikkim.
The immediate civil consequence, if at all, arising from the impugned notification is that the petitioning company has to pay tax @ 14% to the Government of Goa. The liability arises for the specific nature of business carried on by the petitioning company within the territory of Goa. The pleadings do not reflect that any adverse consequence of the impugned notification has been felt within the jurisdiction of the Sikkim High Court
"Here, tax has been levied by the Government of Goa in respect of a business that the petitioning company is carrying on within the territory of Goa. Such tax is payable by the petitioning company not in respect of carrying on of any business in the territory of Sikkim", a bench comprising Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Dipankar Datta observed.
"Hence, merely because the petitioning company has its office in Gangtok, Sikkim, the same by itself does not form an integral part of the cause of action authorizing the petitioning company to move the High Court", the bench added. 
Concept of forum conveniens
Even if a part of cause of action is assumed to have arisen within the State of Sikkim, the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ having regard to the principle of forum conveniens.
"As held by this Court in Kusum Ingots Vs. Union of India and Ambica Industries Vs. CCE, even if a small part of the cause of action arises within the territorial jurisdiction of a high court, the same by itself could not have been a determinative factor compelling the High Court to keep the writ petitions alive against the appellant to decide the matter qua the impugned notification, on merit".
The Court held that the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petitions as against the State of Goa.

Constitution of India - Article 226(2) - Guiding tests to determine whether part of cause of action has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of a High Court- In the context of a writ petition, what would constitute such ‘cause of action’ is the material facts which are imperative for the writ petitioner to plead and prove to obtain relief as claimed- Determination of the question as to whether the facts pleaded constitute a part of the cause of action, sufficient to attract clause (2) of Article 226 of the Constitution, would necessarily involve an exercise by the high court to ascertain that the facts, as pleaded, constitute a material, essential or integral part of the cause of action - In so determining, it is the substance of the matter that is relevant- It, therefore, follows that the party invoking the writ jurisdiction has to disclose that the integral facts pleaded in support of the cause of action do constitute a cause empowering the high court to decide the dispute and that, at least, a part of the cause of action to move the high court arose within its jurisdiction- Such pleaded facts must have a nexus with the subject matter of challenge based on which the prayer can be granted- Those facts which are not relevant or germane for grant of the prayer would not give rise to a cause of action conferring jurisdiction on the court - Para 15

The Gujarat High Court recently allowed a writ seeking direction upon the Registrar of Birth and Death/Chief Officer, to delete the name of a minor's biological father's name from his birth certificate and replace it with his adoptive father's name. 
For this, Justice A.S. Supehia opined that neither is the consent of the biological father required to be obtained by the registrar nor is he required to be arraigned as a party to the writ petition, as the adoption deed was not in question.
The petitioners herein were guardians of their minor son. Petitioner 2 (the husband) was the second husband of the Petitioner 1 (wife) and the minor was born out of her first marriage. Petitioner 1 and her first husband had executed a deed of divorce and Petitioner 1 eventually married petitioner 2, who also agreed to take all responsibilities for her minor son, and a deed of adoption was executed which was duly registered.
The petitioners then filed representation to the respondent authority to replace/mention the name of Petitioner 2 as the father, in place of the minor's biological father, in his birth certificate. This application for correction was refused by the respondent, asking the petitioners to produce an order of the local court with regard to the adoption.
 The counsel for the petitioners argued that, as per Section 16 Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 (hereinafter "the Adoptions Act"), only registered adoption is mandatory. He also referred circulars dated 15.05.2015 and 31.01.2018 issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, which have stated that only registered adoption deed is mandatory and the requirement of decree of adoption from the court concerned has been discontinued. It was also pointed out that the circulars that the impugned order was premised upon had since been cancelled by a subsequent order by the state authority.
 The counsel for the respondent candidly admitted that the circulars that the impugned order was based upon have since been quashed. He submitted that, as per provision of Section 9 of the Adoptions Act, the Registrar has to verify whether the Adoption Deed is valid or not and hence, the biological father has to be made a party respondent in the writ petition in order to verify whether the adoption deed produced by the petitioners is legal or valid.
 The Court was of the opinion that cancellation of the orders that the respondent's decision was based upon, was ground alone for quashing the impugned order. 
 It then referred to Section 15 of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 and noted that Registrar can correct an entry already made in the Birth Register if the same is conceded, and such correction should legitimately take within its sweep the correction of entries rightfully made, since it is the correction of the name of the child at the instance of the parents of wards. 
 The Court then referred to the case of Tushar Kanaiyalal Vyas (Thru. POA) vs. State of Gujarat & Ors., as per which, when the decree of divorce between the biological parents clearly provided that custody of their minor child would be with the wife and the registered deed of adoption has not been challenged, a presumption as per the provision of Section 16 of the Adoptions Act was drawn in favour of the petitioners.
 In the present case, there was a divorce deed that was executed, it was mutually decided that custody of minor son was accepted by the mother-petitioner and there was a valid adoption deed in which the adoptive father-petitioner had assumed responsibility for the minor son. The biological father had neither raised any objection to the custody of the minor nor had he raised any objection to his ex-wife's subsequent marriage and the minor's adoption. 
 In light of the above, the Court held that the stage of obtaining consent, as defined under section 9 of the Adoptions Act, cannot be invoked at the stage of incorporating the father's name (adoptive) in the birth record of the son, after the divorce and adoption deeds have been registered and have not been questioned. Thus, neither the biological father, i.e. the former husband of the petitioner no.1 is required to be made as a party to the writ proceedings for ascertaining his consent nor his opinion is necessary to be called for by the Registrar. 
The Court also opined that as per the provision of section 16 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, a presumption has to be drawn in favour of the petitioners since there is no rebuttal of the adoption deed of the minor. The Registrar, who is the competent authority under the Registration Act, 1969 can only verify the correction of the adoption deed and if the same is found to be duly registered and valid, he has to make necessary corrections/changes in the birth records of the adopted child.
 The Court directed the respondent authority to correct the father's name and incorporate the name of Petitioner 2 in the minor's birth certificate and accordingly issue a fresh certificate within one month from the date of receipt of the order.

The Jharkhand High Court has quashed the merit list of the 6th Combined Civil service Examination, 2016 which was conducted by the State Public Service Commission (JPSC) to fill 326 positions.
 A Single Bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar Dwivedi quashed the result upon noting that the merit list was not prepared by the JPSC by following the criteria of minimum qualifying marks in each paper.
 "There is no doubt, the Commission is master of its working and the Courts normally are not entitled to question the mechanism of selection. But at the same time, if the illegality has been brought to the knowledge of the Court, the same cannot be ignored and the Court is bound to interfere," the judge observed.
"The Public Service Commission have no power to relax the recruitment norms. In the case in hand, the JPSC deviated from the norms prescribed in the advertisement", the Court added.
The Petitioners' contention was that the action of the JPSC in adding the total marks obtained by the candidates and not the minimum qualifying marks in each paper and the marks of Paper-I of General Hindi and General English while preparing the merit list is illegal
 It was stated that the purpose of this paper is merely to test the working minimum working knowledge of the persons and not their merit otherwise.
 The JPSC had admitted that marks of Paper-I were added in the merit list of the Mains examination, and that minimum qualifying marks of each paper were not taken into consideration and only total marks were considered for preparing the merit list.
 Taking exception to this, the Court observed that JPSC does not have the power to relax the recruitment norms.
 It has therefore directed JPSC to prepare a fresh merit list within 8 weeks, considering the minimum qualifying marks in each paper, and recommend the same to the Jharkhand Government within 4 weeks thereafter. 
 The competent authority of the State has been directed to issue appointment letters in favour of the successful candidates based upon the fresh merit list forthwith.
 The High Court has also ordered the State Government to take appropriate action upon the Commission by fixing accountability and by taking appropriate legal action so that such illegality may not occur in the future and confidence of people upon the Commission may prevail.
 The development comes in a batch of Petitions challenging the final appointment cum result of 6th Combined Civil Services Examination, 2016.
 The Court allowed 5 (out of 15) writ petitions by quashing the final result of the Civil Services Examination. Consequently, appointment of 326 successful candidates, who were in service since June 2020, have been set aside.
"The appointment to any public post must be absolutely transparent and fair and it must be in accordance with the prescribed procedure. Even ad-hoc appointment should not be encouraged as far as possible and should be adhered to only when public exigency required and appointment in accordance with the prescribed procedure would take a fairly long time and non-filling of the post would be against the public interest. Thus, Article 16 of the Constitution of India has been violated. If appointment is made without following the rules, the same being a nullity the question of confirmation of an employee upon the expiry of the purported period of probation would not arise", the Court observed. 
"There is no doubt that after appearance in the examination, the candidates are not allowed to challenge the criteria as argued by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the JPSC, State and successful candidates. However, it is also well settled that a candidate by agreeing to participate in selection process only accepts the prescribed procedure and not the illegality in it. In a situation where a candidate alleges misconstruction of statutory rule and discriminating consequences arises therefrom, the same cannot be condoned merely because a candidate has partaken in it. The constitutional scheme is required to be followed",
 Case Title: Rahul Kumar & Ors. v. State of Jharkhand
 Read Order

In an important judgment, the Orissa High Court yesterday directed the State Government to constitute an Advisory Board of health care experts to draw up a 'Comprehensive Action Plan' to address the issue of maternal deaths. It has also ordered the Government to come up with a Scheme or Policy to address the need for providing redress including award of compensation for every avoidable maternal death and the fixing of responsibility in a time-bound manner.
 The above directions were issued by a Division Bench of Chief Justice Dr. S. Muralidhar and Justice Murahari Sri Raman while deciding the case relating to death of a tribal lady, who died in 2015 at the time of delivery.
 "In the present case, there has been an acute failure of the entire teams of doctors at each level of the health care system in Odisha to provide timely and adequate care and treatment to the deceased as pointed out by the EC. It shocks the judicial conscience that a poor tribal woman had been carrying a dead foetus for a week prior to her death with not one person in the health care system being able to provide her the needed care and treatment and which neglect resulted in her inevitable death. There has been a clear violation of the fundamental right to health of the deceased which constitutes an integral part of the right to life guaranteed in Article 21 of the Constitution of India", the Bench observed.
 Factual Background:
 A petition was filed by the father-in-law of the woman, who not only lost her baby due to an intra-uterine death but herself died while receiving treatment on 25th March, 2015. The petitioner submitted that the death of the baby as well as the woman was due to medical negligence and was avoidable.
 In May 2022, a Division Bench of Chief Justice Dr. S. Muralidhar and Justice Radha Krishna Pattanaik had noted that the pleadings in the petition presented disputed questions of fact with the opposite parties claiming that there was no medical negligence. Further, the opposite parties appeared to have conducted an enquiry into the maternal death of the woman in question. 
 Therefore, with a view to obtain an objective assessment of the materials on record, the Court requested the Odisha State Commission for Women ('OSCW') to assist it in the task and had issued a slew of directions. The Enquiry Committee ('EC') of the OSCW, accordingly, submitted its report on 8th July 2022 to the Court.
 Observations of the Court:
 The Bench noted the findings of the EC which, inter alia, found severe negligence on the part of doctors and staff at several levels and observed,
 "On an in-depth consideration of oral, documentary evidence and surrounding circumstances, the Enquiry Team is of considered view that the deceased Martha Sabar died due to combined negligence of doctors on duty of DHH, Paralakhemundi in the district of Gajapati and Garabandha PHC (New), ASHA, ANM and AWW…Efforts should be made by Highest Hon'ble Court to penalize erring doctors/DHH who have betrayed the faith of a tribal illiterate poor woman and to issue instructions to ensure timely availability of all schemes to poor persons in true sense of the action and not by paperwork." 
 The Court held that the extent of negligence is palpable in the finding of the EC that in bed-head ticket, the cause of death is shown to be due to 'severe sepsis' with 'pulmonary embolism' but no oxygen was provided. The Court also noted that the deceased not only was deprived of the benefits under the various schemes, but she even spent money in the hospital for blood test and for Ultrasound test through Private Radiological Centre. 
 The Court resentfully observed,
 "The victim was a poor tribal woman whom the State health care system failed. Despite so many schemes on paper, meant to deliver benefits to her, she died due to the sheer callousness of the State authorities, doctors, para-medical workers and staff. Even the basic first-level care and treatment at the level of the ASHA and ANM under the NHM were not provided to the deceased in the present case. She was never given advice although hers was a high-risk pregnancy… It is indeed extremely unfortunate that the benefit of the multifarious schemes which are meant to cater to the needs of the poor and vulnerable like the deceased in the present case do not reach them in time."
 Chief Justice Muralidhar, speaking for the Bench, made some serious observations regarding the failure of the state machinery to ensure the implementation of various schemes formulated for the benefit of the poor and downtrodden. He observed,
 "This Court is constrained to note that Martha Sabar's death is not an isolated instance as far as Odisha is concerned. The number of women in the tribal belts, in the rural and semi-urban areas, who have lost lives during pregnancy and as a result of unsafe deliveries is a matter for deep concern… The increasing numbers of maternal deaths in Odisha point to a systemic failure of the health care system which appears to have failed the poorest and the weakest at a time when they need it the most."
 After perusing the reports, the Court made strong reference to the decision of the Apex Court in People's Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India and the decision of the Delhi High Court in Laxmi Mandal v. Harinagar Hospital (authored by CJ Muralidhar as a Judge of Delhi High Court) to reverberate the duty of the State to provide the benefits of manifold schemes to pregnant ladies and to ensure all requisite steps to avoid maternal deaths.
 Actions Against The Errants:
 The Court came down heavily on the errant doctors/staff whose ignorance ultimately culminated in the avoidable death of Martha Sabar. It accordingly directed the State Government to immediately issue show cause notices to each of the doctors, health workers and staff whose conduct has been adversely commented upon by the EC of the OSCW in its report and to take appropriate disciplinary actions against them after receiving replies.
 Compensation to the Family:
 The Court directed the Government of Odisha to pay the family members a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs within a period of six weeks from the date of order. The compensation amount was directed to be kept in fixed deposits (FDs) in the names of her in-laws and husband. FDs for Rs.3,50,000/- each was ordered to be made in favour of the mother-in-law and the father-in-law of the deceased and an FD for Rs.3,00,000/- in favour of her husband Ganpati Sabar.
 Directions for Constitution of Advisory Body and Formulation of Scheme:
 The Court observed that there is an urgent need for proper orientation, training and sensitisation of support workers including the ASHAs, ANMs and Anganwadi Workers whose role is crucial for the proper delivery of the range of health measures in the various schemes floated by the state and central governments.
 The Court also endorsed the suggestions made by the OSCW on strengthening the system for better delivery of the large number of welfare-oriented health related schemes for women and children in general and pregnant women in particular. It accordingly directed the State Government through its Additional Chief Secretary (Health) Government of Odisha to immediately constitute an Advisory body of health care experts to draw up a Comprehensive Action Plan which will contain both preventive and remedial action points in the short and medium term to address the issue of maternal deaths. 
 The State Government was also directed to separately come up with a Scheme or Policy to address the need for providing redress including award of compensation for every needless maternal death, the fixing of responsibility on errant doctors, para medics and staff in a time-bound manner. The exercise of drawing up a Comprehensive Action Plan and formulating a Scheme/Policy for providing compensation as directed above was ordered to be completed within a period of four months from the date of order.

While affirming that the commission of robbery by five or more persons is an essential ingredient of dacoity under Section 391 of IPC, the Gujarat High Court refused to set aside the order of the Sessions Court acquitting the accused persons.
A Bench bench comprising Justice SH Vora and Justice Sandeep N Bhatt observed,
"According to section 391 of IPC, dacoity is robbery committed by five or more persons. Essential element of offence of dacoity under section 395 is that five or more persons must have participated in the offence of dacoity. No such evidence is coming on record so as to infer that respondent nos.3 to 6 actually participated in committing offence of dacoity."
 Background
 The Complainant registered a complaint with the Vadnagar Police Station alleging that the Complainant's son and the son of the accused had a quarrel and subsequently, Respondent 1 and 2 inflicted bat blows on the body of the Complainant. The Complainant further alleged that there were other accused as well who had beaten him and thereafter, they grabbed the jewelry of the Complainant and robbed him.
 The Prosecution examined several witnesses and produced documentary evidence to bring home the charges under sections 395, 397, 323, 504, 506(2) of IPC. The Respondents denied their involvement in the offence and contended that on account of enmity with regard to certain land and the election of Sarpanch, a false case has been registered against them.
 Accordingly, the Trial Court acquitted the accused.
 Judgement
 The Bench began by observing that in most cases involving offences under Sections 395 and 397 of IPC, accused persons are usually unknown. But in the instant case, this is not so since the accused and the victim are well known to each other. 
Further, barring the statement of the Complainant and the Complainant's son, no other Prosecution's witnesses have supported the Prosecution's case with regard to the alleged incident. There was also no recovery of any gold ornaments from the accused persons. 
The Bench noted that there was prior rivalry between the two parties on account of an election matter. Additionally, the Doctor did not notice any injury on the Complainant's ear where the earring was snatched. The Complainant's son also did not allege dacoity or robbery. Hence, the Prosecution's story did not inspire the confidence of the Bench.
 The Court then ventured into explaining the ingredients for securing conviction Section 391 of IPC:
 that the dacoity as defined in section 391 of IPC has been committed that it was committed by the accused persons.
 The Court also emphasised the phrase "co-jointly" to indicate that the offence must involve five or more persons. This was an "essential element" of offence under Section 395. The Court noted that there was no evidence to support the involvement of Respondents 3-6 in committing the offence of dacoity. Therefore, the acquittal of the accused persons by the Trial Court was correct.
 The Bench cautioned that "it is the cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence that in an acquittal appeal if other view is possible, then also, the appellate Court cannot substitute its own view by reversing the acquittal into conviction, unless the findings of the trial Court are perverse, contrary to the material on record, palpably wrong, manifestly erroneous or demonstrably unsustainable." This view was affirmed in Ram Kumar v. State of Haryana [AIR 1995 SC 280].
 Accordingly, the Court dismissed the criminal appeal.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court, Indore Bench recently directed a Government Bank to reverse its decision of cancelling the candidature of a successful candidate for the post of Office Assistant (Multi purpose) due to typographical error in date of birth, and to further issue appointment order in her favour.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court, Indore Bench recently directed a Government Bank to reverse its decision of cancelling the candidature of a successful candidate for the post of Office Assistant (Multi purpose) due to typographical error in date of birth, and to further issue appointment order in her favour.
 Justice Pranay Verma observed,
"It is not the case of respondent itself that the petitioner has derived any advantage by entering the wrong date of birth in the application. There was no intentional misrepresentation on part of the petitioner as she had submitted her school Certificate. There is a difference between a mere inadvertent error and misrepresentation or suppression. Cancellation of candidature of petitioner on the ground of typographical error in her application form is hence arbitrary and grossly disproportionate to the gravity of her lapse."
The case of the Petitioner was that she had appeared in written exam for the post of Office Assistant (Multi purpose) in the Respondent Bank and successfully cleared the same. However, while submitting her application for the said exam, she made a typographical error and mentioned her date of birth to be 02.11.1991, instead of 04.11.1991. While the Bank initially gave her the offer letter, they later rejected her candidature at the stage of documents verification on the ground that she mentioned her date of birth incorrectly. Petitioner submitted a representation to the Bank, seeking permission to make necessary changes in her form but they did not decide on the same.
 The Petitioner argued that she had not gained anything out of mentioning the wrong date of birth and was eligible for the said post either way. She submitted that she was duly selected on merit and that it was an inadvertent typographical mistake on her part which ought to have been condoned.
 The Court opined that when material discrepancy is noticed in the application form, the candidature may be cancelled even after the application has been processed and candidate has been allowed to participate in the selection process. But when a candidate has participated in the selection process and has cleared all the stages successfully, candidature should not be cancelled without careful scrutiny of the gravity of the lapse. The same, however, it noted, cannot be done for minor omissions or errors.
 Considering the factual matrix of the matter, the Court noted that it was neither a case of deliberate misrepresentation on the part of the Petitioner nor did she derive any benefit out of her mistake.
 With the aforesaid observations, the Court allowed the Petition, directing the Respondent Bank to consider the candidature of the Petitioner and further to issue appointment order in her favour.

The Supreme Court observed that the burden of proof on an accused in support of the defence taken under Section 313 of Code of Criminal Procedure is not beyond all reasonable doubt as it lies on the prosecution to prove the charge
The accused has merely to create a doubt and it is for the prosecution then to establish beyond reasonable doubt that no benefit can flow from the same to the accused, the bench of  Justices Navin Sinha and R. Subhash Reddy said while acquitting a woman accused of murdering her sister in law.
In this case, the deceased died in the matrimonial home in about one and a half years of the marriage suffering 95% burn injuries. The younger brother of deceased aged about 11 - 12 years was the sole eye witness. The sister in law of the deceased, along with other accused were charged for murder. The Trial Court convicted her relying on the testimony of the child witness that she stuffed cloth in the mouth of the deceased after which she was set on fire by other accused. The High Court dismissed her appeal.
In appeal, the accused contended that she had taken a specific defence in her statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. that she resided in her matrimonial home, which was separate and at a distance. It was further contended that the allegation against her by the child witness was never put to her under Section 313 CrPC thus depriving her of a valuable opportunity 1 of defence which vitiates her conviction.
"We are of the considered opinion that in absence of any question having been put to her in this regard under Section 313 CrPC the appellant has been seriously prejudiced in her defence. It has repeatedly been held that the procedure under Section 313 CrPC is but a facet of the principles of natural justice giving an opportunity to an accused to present the defence. The burden of proof on an accused in support of the defence taken under Section 313 CrPC is not beyond all reasonable doubt as it lies on the prosecution to prove the charge. The accused has merely to create a doubt. It will be for the prosecution then to establish beyond reasonable doubt that no benefit can flow from the same to the accused. The mere fact that the house of the appellant was at near quarters cannot ipso facto lead to a conclusion with regard to her presence in her parental home at the time of occurrence. It is a fact to be established and assessed from the evidence on record.", the court said accepting the accused's contention [referred to Janak Yadav v. State of Bihar, (1999) 9 SCC 125].
Not Deposed That Closed Was Taken From Her Mouth
The court noted that at no stage, the witness deposed that the cloth was taken out from her mouth, but stated that the deceased was speaking while she was being taken to hospital. "It stands to reason that if cloth was stuffed in the mouth of deceased she would have been unable to speak.", the bench noted. The bench also noticed that the doctor who performed post mortem also stated that no cloth was present in the mouth of the deceased and that all the 32 teeth were intact.
"The discussion and reasoning by the trial court that absence of any cloth in the mouth was irrelevant because if the deceased suffered hundred per cent burns the cloth naturally could not be available, suggesting that it would have been burnt also is completely fallacious.", the bench said while observing that the evidence of child witness in this case attributing a specific role to the accused is not of such a sterling quality so as to inspire confidence in the court to base the conviction on the sole evidence of a child witness. 
She was a daughter-in-law like the deceased herself
"She was a daughter-in-law like the deceased herself. The nature of the evidence makes it highly unlikely that she would have engaged in such actions. The benefit of doubt in the circumstances has to be given to the appellant.", the bench said while setting aside conviction of the accused.
Mere absence of any corroborative evidence in addition to that of the child witness by itself cannot alone discredit a child witness. 
Though, the court in this case disbelieved the child witness, it said that criminal jurisprudence does not hold that the evidence of a child witness is unreliable and can be discarded. 
"A child who is aged about 11 to 12 years certainly has reasonably developed mental faculty to see, absorb and appreciate. In a given case the evidence of a child witness alone can also form the basis for conviction. The mere absence of any corroborative evidence in addition to that of the child witness by itself cannot alone discredit a child witness. But the Courts have regularly held that where a child 2 witness is to be considered, and more so when he is the sole witness, a heightened level of scrutiny is called for of the evidence so that the Court is satisfied with regard to the reliability and genuineness of the evidence of the child witness. PW-2 was examined nearly one year after the occurrence. The Court has, therefore, to satisfy itself that all possibilities of tutoring or otherwise are ruled out and what was deposed was nothing but the truth." [Referred to State of M.P. vs. Ramesh, (2011) 4 SCC 786]

If the role attributed to the accused in an offence is prima facie less serious than the role attributed to the co-accused who have been granted the benefit of bail under S.438 CrPC and under S.439 CrPC, and if the accused is a first-time offender, then he deserves an opportunity to course-correct and the opportunity of bail cannot be denied to him. A single-judge bench of...
If the role attributed to the accused in an offence is prima facie less serious than the role attributed to the co-accused who have been granted the benefit of bail under S.438 CrPC and under S.439 CrPC, and if the accused is a first-time offender, then he deserves an opportunity to course-correct and the opportunity of bail cannot be denied to him.
 A single-judge bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court presided over by Justice Anoop Chitkara has recently observed that if the accused is a first-time offender and if his co-accused who were similarly placed, have been granted bail, even though the role of co-accused in the offence was more serious than that of the accused, then accused's bail application should be accepted and the accused should be given a chance for grant of bail.
 The facts of the case involve an accused from Sonipat who had been charged under Sections 148 (Rioting armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of the offence committed in prosecution of a common object), 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapon), 325 (Punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) under the FIR. 
He had approached the High Court seeking bail under S.439 (Special Powers of High Court or Court of Sessions regarding Bail) of CrPC. 
While the counsel for the petitioner, Advocate Vikas Gulia argued that custodial investigation would serve no purpose and surmised that pre-trial incarceration would cause injustice to the petitioner and his family, the DAG representing State contended that since the challan has been presented and charges have been framed, accused should not be granted bail.
 The Court concluded that the possibility of the accused to influence the investigation or to tamper with evidence or to intimidate the witnesses and subsequent thwarting of justice could be taken care of by imposing stringent and elaborate conditions.
It relied on judgment in Gurbaksh Singh v. the State of Punjab which held that the bail decision must enter cumulative effect of the variety of circumstances justifying the grant/refusal of bail.
Reference was also made to Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan where a three-judge bench of Supreme Court held that if the prosecution fails to establish a prima facie case against the accused, then even persons accused in non-bailable offences are entitled to bail. 
The Court further recalled the norm of bail, not jail; except where circumstances suggest thwarting the course of justice.
 And thus, without commenting on the merits of the case, the Court granted the petitioner bail subject to him joining the investigation and fully cooperating with investigating agencies and following the below-mentioned conditions 
 That he shall furnish a personal bond of INR 10000That he shall furnish one surety of INR 25000 to the satisfaction of concerned court/judicial magistrate having jurisdiction That he shall execute a bond for attendance in the concerned court, as and when asked toThat he shall not influence, browbeat, pressurize, threaten or promise directly or indirectly to witnesses, police officials or any other person acquainted with facts of the case to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the police/court or to tamper with evidence. That till the completion of the trial, the petition shall not contact, call, text, message, remark, stare, stalk, make any gestures or express any unusual or inappropriate, verbal or otherwise objectionable behaviour towards the victim and victim's family, either physically or through a phone call or any other social media, through any other mode, nor shall he unnecessarily roam around the victim's home. That the petitioner shall surrender all weapons, firearms, ammunition along with arms license to the concerned authority within 30 days from his release from prison and inform the investigator about such compliance.

The Supreme Court observed that Section 188 of the Criminal Procedure Code will not be attracted if a part of the offence was committed in India.
The Section gets attracted when the entirety of the offence is committed outside India; and the grant of sanction would enable such offence to be enquired into or tried in India, the bench comprising Justices Uday Umesh Lalit, S. Ravindra Bhat and Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha observed.
In this case, the Uttarakhand High Court, reversed the acquittal recorded by the Trial Court and convicted the accused of the offences punishable under Sections 363, 366-B, 370(4) and 506 of the IPC, and under Section 8 of the POCSO Act. The accused had allegedly imported a minor girl, who is the resident of Nepal to India, for exploitation.
One of the contentions raised by the accused in appeal before the Supreme Court was that the requirements under Section 188 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 were not satisfied and no sanction in terms of said Section was placed on record; and that in the absence of such sanction, the accused could not have been tried.
Under Section 188 CrPC, even if an offence is committed outside India, (a) by a citizen whether on the high seas or anywhere else or (b) by a non-citizen on a ship or aircraft registered in India, the offence can still be tried in India provided the conditions mentioned in said Section are satisfied. 
Referring to the evidence on record, the bench noted that a part of the offence was committed in India. The Court observed:
 The Section gets attracted when the entirety of the offence is committed outside India; and the grant of sanction would enable such offence to be enquired into or tried in India......As the facts and circumstances of the case indicate, a part of the offence was definitely committed on the soil of this country and as such going by the normal principles the offence could be looked into and tried by Indian courts. Since the offence was not committed in its entirety, outside India, the matter would not come within the scope of Section 188 of the Code and there was no necessity of any sanction as mandated by the proviso to Section 188. 
Dismissing the appeal, the court observed that the offences alleged against the appellant were rightly invoked and fully substantiated.

Disapproving the blanket orders passed by a single judge of the Rajasthan High Court to not list applications for bail and suspension of sentence as urgent matters during the lockdown, the Supreme Court has observed that the right to apply for bail is an individual right implicit in Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.
The Court has observed that such blanket bans would suspend Fundamental Rights of individuals and block access for seekers of liberty to apply for bail.
A Bench comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose made the observations while delivering the judgement in special leave petitions filed against orders of the Rajasthan High Court which directed the Registry to not to list bails, appeals, applications for suspension of sentence in appeals and revisions in the category of extreme urgent matters.
Also under challenge was a direction issued by the single bench this year to the Registry to not list applications seeking anticipatory bail in offences where maximum sentence extends upto three years during the summer vacation of the Court.
These orders were challenged before the Supreme Court by the Rajasthan High Court itself.
"Such an order also has the effect of temporarily eclipsing statutory provisions" the Supreme Court said.
While noting that the blanket order was passed by the High Court without compliance of procedure established by law, the Bench has observed that blanket order prohibiting listing of bail application or applications for suspension of sentence in appeals also infringes upon the right of personal liberty of incarcerated persons.
"Such right has been taken away by judicial order, without compliance of procedure established by law, which in our constitutional jurisprudence, is akin to "the due process" dictum." the Bench said.
"Right to apply for bail is an individual right implicit in Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution", the judgment authored by Justice Bose stated. 
The Court also observed that the right of an accused, an undertrial prisoner or a convicted person awaiting appeal court's verdict to seek bail on suspension of sentence is recognised in Sections 439, 438 and 389 of the 1973 Criminal Procedure Code.
The Bench also found it improper for the Single Judge to come to a general finding that when there is complete lockdown the bail applications, appeal under SC/ST Act and applications for suspension of sentence in appeals and revisions could not be considered to be matters of extreme urgency.
"Such sweeping orders in our adversarial adjudicatory system would be contrary to law as many persons would be impacted by such orders without having any knowledge of the proceeding." the Bench said. 
While delivering its verdict, the Bench expressed disapproval of both the directions of restrictions on arrest and listing of bail applications issued by a single bench of the High Court.
"The directions issued had the potential for breaching the constitutional and legal rights of individuals who could be or are arraigned in criminal action and also put fetters on power of investigating agencies." the Bench recorded. 
The impugned orders were issued in applications for anticipatory bails when the Covid-19 pandemic was raging across this country. However the bail pleas were ultimately rejected by the High Court later.
Observing that the impact of the orders under appeal no more survives, the Bench refrained from formally setting aside the orders while allowing the Rajasthan High Court's appeal. 
There were two Special Leave Petitions before the Supreme Court - SLP(Crl) No.5618/2020 and SLP(Crl) No.3949/2021. The first one challenged the order passed by a single bench of High Court on March 30 last year directing the Registry to not list applications for bail and sentence suspension as urgent matters during the period of lockdown. The second SLP challenged the order passed by the single bench on May 17 this year, in which the restraint order against police regarding arrests in cases with less than 3 years imprisonment as punishment and the direction to not list anticipatory bail applications in cases with less than 3 years imprisonment as punishment were passed. Incidentally, both the impugned orders were passed by a bench of Justice Pankaj Bhandari.
The Supreme Court had earlier stayed the operation of both the orders. The order passed on March 30, 2020 was stayed by the Supreme Court on April 3, 2020. The order passed on May 17, 2021, was stayed by a vacation bench of the Supreme Court on May 25, 2021.

Emphasizing the duty of the Court to encourage genuine settlement of matrimonial disputes, the Supreme Court set aside conviction of a man under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 ('IPC').
In this case, the husband was convicted under Section 498-A IPC and was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment of three years. Sessions Judge dismissed the appeal filed by him. Partly allowing the Revision Petition, the High Court of Jharkhand taking note of the settlement between the parties, confirmed the conviction under Section 498-A IPC while reducing the sentence to the period of imprisonment already undergone.
In appeal before the Apex Court, the issue raised was whether the High Court, even after taking note of the settlement of the parties resolving their marital disputes, has erred in not setting aside the order of conviction altogether?
The Apex Court bench comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Vikram Nath opined that maintaining of conviction of the appellant of the offence under Section 498-A IPC would not be securing the ends of justice. With such conviction being maintained and the appellant losing his job, the family would again land itself in financial distress which may ultimately operate adverse to the harmony and happy conjugal life of the parties, the bench said.
Before the Court, both the parties reiterated their stand that they have resolved their disputes and are living together while leading a happy conjugal life. The court, thus, observed:
"Taking note of the object of Section 498-A IPC, the expected approach of the High Court in the event of bona fide settlement of disputes had been duly exposited by this Court in the case of B.S. Joshi and Others v. State of Haryana and Another: (2003) 4 SCC 675, where this Court has underscored the duty of the Court to encourage the genuine settlement of matrimonial disputes"
The court also referred to the judgment in Bitan Sengupta & Anr. v. State of West Bengal & Anr. : (2018) 18 SCC 366. Allowing the appeal, the bench observed:
"In the aforesaid view of the matter, and taking note of the terms of settlement as stated in the application moved before the High Court which include the undertaking of the appellant that he would be nominating the respondent No. 2 as the nominee in his service record; and where the parties are said to be leading a happy conjugal life, we are clearly of the view that the High Court should have accepted the settlement and quashed all the proceedings with annulment of the orders against the appellant. The High Court having not done so, we are inclined to adopt this course so as to secure the ends of justice."

The Calcutta High Court has recently held that the abscondence of an accused by itself does not establish his guilt and accordingly proceeded to set aside an order of conviction for the commission of the offence of murder under Section 302 of the IPC. 
A Bench comprising Justice Joymalya Bagchi and Justice Ananya Bandyopadhyay was adjudicating upon an appeal preferred against an order of conviction passed against the appellant for murdering a 10 year old boy. It was alleged that the appellant had illicit relationship with Rasida, mother of the boy. It was further contended that the child had disclosed the illicit relationship to his father and accordingly appellant nursed a grudge against him.
During the proceedings, it was contended on behalf of the prosecution that the appellant had gone missing from the mosque immediately after the incident and did not return to the village and that the appellant had been arrested later at Panskura railway station.
The Court relied upon the Supreme Court judgment in Sk. Yusuf v. State of West Bengal to rule that it is a settled law that the abscondence of an accused by itself does not establish his guilt. 
"The aforesaid proposition of law wholly applies to the facts of the present case. Evidence on record shows apart from vague suspicion owing to a hunch that the appellant may have nursed grudge against the child for divulging his illicit association with her mother, no evidence was led to show that the appellant had clear access to the child soon before his death so as to complete the chain of circumstances pointing to his guilt", the Court observed. 
It was further noted that the father of the deceased had not initially lodged an FIR against the appellant and that only after a couple of days out of suspicion the appellant had been implicated in the instant case. 
Opining further that there is a likelihood that the appellant had run away from the village out of fear and apprehension of false implication, the Court underscored, 
"Under such circumstance, it is likely out of fear and apprehension of false implication and harassment the appellant may have ran away from the village and secreted himself. Abscondence of the appellant when judged in the backdrop of the fact and circumstance of the case cannot by any stretch of imagination be treated to be conclusive evidence with regard to his guilt."
Accordingly, the Court held that the appellant has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and that the appellant is entitled to an order of acquittal.

The Calcutta High Court has recently upheld an eviction order wherein the daughter-in-law was directed to vacate the residence belonging to her father-in-law after noting that she is a medical practitioner and is thus not in a poor financial condition.

The Calcutta High Court has recently upheld an eviction order wherein the daughter-in-law was directed to vacate the residence belonging to her father-in-law after noting that she is a medical practitioner and is thus not in a poor financial condition. 
Justice Rajasekhar Mantha observed, 
"The applicant, Swati Das, is admittedly a medical practitioner. She is neither destitute nor in a poor economic or financial condition, and there is no averment to that effect in the application. Apart from the questions of law raised by the applicant daughter-in-law, she has not able to make out any case for restoration with possession of her father-in-law's house."
The Court noted that the applicant had never claimed any right of residence or share of the household against the father-in-law or her husband under the provisions of the the Domestic Violence Act, 2005. It was also noted that the applicant had not asserted any domestic violence or torture perpetrated by either her father-in-law or her husband.
Thus, the Court opined that it can exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction of this court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to protect the life and liberty of the senior citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution. 
"In respect of a discomfort expressed by a senior citizen towards his children, a single complaint is good enough evidence. Further, there are no disputed questions of fact in the instant case i.e., that the house admittedly belongs to the father of the writ petitioner", the Court underscored further. 
It was further observed that the Writ Court under Article 226 has jurisdiction to evict sons and daughters-in-law from the residence of senior citizens, if the latter is uncomfortable or inconvenienced by the presence of any of the former. The applicant and her ex-husband are at best licensees in the house of the father-in-law, it was stated further. 
Reliance was placed on the Calcutta High Court decision in Ramapada Basak v. State of West Bengal& Ors wherein it had been held that that children and their spouses living in the senior citizen's house are at best "licensees" and that the said license comes to an end once the senior citizens are not comfortable with their children and their families.
During the proceedings, the applicant daughter-in-law had sought the recall of the impugned eviction order dated December 9, 2021 on the ground that she did not receive notice of the writ petition. She had argued that a copy of the writ petition was not supplied to her and that someone else- possibly someone on behalf of the petitioner had collected the said writ petition.
 Dismissing such a contention, the Court observed, 
"The Court however, is sufficiently satisfied with the evidence forwarded by the postal authorities, as also the reasons provided in the affidavit filed. Satisfactory reasons have been provided for absence/lack of a physical pay-slip of delivery, as well as for the lack of a signature in the electronic device used by the postman, wherein, as per the postman, the lady of the house who received the package had refused to sign citing COVID conditions. It therefore cannot be said that there is no proof of delivery of the writ petition to Swati Das, the applicant."
Case Title: Debaki Nandan Maiti v. The State of West Bengal and Ors.

The Calcutta High Court bench of Justice T.S. Shivagnanam and Justice Hirnmay Bhattacharyya has held that the GST department cannot detain vehicles in the absence of a second e-way bill as the first e-way bill was valid in the interception period.
 The respondent/assessee submitted that the detention of the vehicle along with the goods and the demand for tax and penalty were not justified. The e-way bill,  which was being carried in the vehicle transporting the goods, expired at midnight on September 8, 2019 and the goods were transported on September 9, 2019. The vehicle was intercepted at 1.30 p.m. (noon). 
 The assessee contended that the vehicle transporting goods had broken down and, on account of that, there was delay and there was no willful intention to evade payment of tax. 
 The department filed an appeal before the Single Judge Bench. The single Bench disposed of the writ petition by setting aside the order dated September 11, 2019. It was held that the assessee was entitled to get a refund of penalty and tax paid on protest, subject to compliance with all legal formalities. The department was aggrieved by such an order and appealed before the division bench.
 The department contended that neither before the appellate authority nor in the pleadings in the writ petition, the assessee had stated anything about the vehicle being broken down or that the non-extension of the validity of the e-way bill was not deliberate and willful but due to the circumstances as stated. When such was the factual position, the single bench ought not to have allowed the writ petition by accepting the argument, which was placed for the first time when the writ petition was moved before the Court.
 The assessee contended that the writ petitioner had raised a tax invoice in favour of Om Dayal Educational and Research Society, which had its registered office at Kolkata but the goods had to be delivered as per the instruction of the purchaser at Delhi Public School, Sector–2D, Bidhannagar, Durgapur. The assessee had raised a second e-way bill as the the distance between the places was 9 kilometres, the e-way bill was valid upto September 8, 2019. The vehicle number in both the e-way bills will clearly show that it is the same vehicle.
 The court held that the bona fides of the writ petitioner had to be tested on the documents, which were available on record.
 "The first e-way bill dated September 7th, 2019 was valid up to September 9th, 2019. Therefore, in the absence of the second e-way bill, the tax authorities at Durgapur could not have intercepted or detained the vehicle. Therefore, the explanation offered by the respondent/writ petitioner was an acceptable explanation and a case cannot be made out that there was a deliberate and willful attempt on the part of the respondent/writ petitioner to evade payment of tax so as to justify invocation of the power under Section 129 of the Act," the court while granting the relief to the assessee observed.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court has directed the State Government to ensure timely administration of Amphotericin B and other medicines to Black fungus patients in the State while observing that no patient must suffer from lack of medicines.
A Bench of Chief Justice Mohammad Rafiq and Justice Vijay Kumar Shukla also directed the Additional Chief Secretary of the Department of Medical and Health, Government of Madhya Pradesh to place on record the exact position with regard to number of patients of black and white fungus or any other kind of similar disease, in the State.
The Court clarified that the medicines should surely be prescribed to the patients by the treating doctors not only in Jabalpur but also in Hospitals of the other cities including Gwalior, Indore, Bhopal and elsewhere in the State.
The order was passed after Senior Advocate Naman Nagrath with Advocate Jubin Prasad appointed as amicus curiae, apprised the Court that family members of more than 50 patients of black fungus, admitted in Government Hospital at Jabalpur, had gheraoed the officials of the Government as they were not provided with Amphotericin – B medicine, endangering life of the patients.
The development came after the State Government had filed the 11th Action Taken Report in compliance of the earlier order highlighting various issues concerning the covid-19 situation in the State.
According to the report, it was stated that out of 188 oxygen generation plants, 61 plants we already commissioned, equipment for 13 more plants was delivered by the concerned agency and that installation process was in progress. It was also stated that as per the estimate of the State Government, the remaining plants will be installed by 30th September, 2021. 
Furthermore, out of 52 district hospitals of the State, C.T. Scan Machines were functional in 14 districts and that steps were taken to install CT Scan Machine in the remaining districts as well, the Bench was told.
As per the supplies of vaccines so far received, the Court was informed that the State was expected to be in a position to cover the entire 18 plus population by inoculation with the first dose by the end of September, 2021. 
It was also stated that due to focused and concentrated efforts by the Government, a full immunization cover would be provided to the entire 18 plus population by the end of December, 2021.
"This Court places on record its appreciation of the work so far undertaken by the State Government with regard to the establishment of oxygen plants, CT Scan Machines and Oxygen/ICU/HDU/PICU beds in all District Government Hospitals of the State. This Court appreciates the all out efforts put in by the officials of the State and applauds its performance with regard to inoculation of the sizeable population of the State that it shall by the end of September, would provide the safety cover of immunization of first dose to entire 18 plus population and has given the hope that all such people shall be provided with full immunization cover by the end of the year 2021," the Court said.
The matter will now be considered on September 6.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Wednesday expressed concern over the enormous number of protection petitions being filed before it by runaway and inter-faith couples.
 A Single Bench of Justice Avneesh Jhingan while stating that the genuine cases of threat are often overlooked amid a pile of cases that are filed on a daily basis, suggested several steps to make the executive responsible for offering protection to the lives of such couples, so that burden on Courts is reduced.
 The Judge, inter alia, suggested:
 Safe houses should be made available in each district of Punjab and Haryana, as well as in Union Territory, Chandigarh. A website or an on-line module should be provided for such like couples to raise their grievances without being physically present. Providing of 24x7 help desk at Tehsil level for filing of such representations by aggrieved persons or through someone. An existing cell in Police department can be deputed or a new cell can be created which can deal with the representation in a time-bound manner, in any case not beyond 48 hours. It can also be ensured by authorities that in case a request is made by the couples during the period of consideration of the representation, they be provided shelter in safe houseThe Legal Services Authorities can set up 24x7 help desk for such couples with telephone service and internet connectivity at the local level.
 As the State Counsels gave positive responses to the above suggestions, the Court directed the Advocate Generals of both the States, Senior Standing Counsel for Union Territory, Chandigarh and Member Secretaries of the Legal Services Authorities to make a joint effort for dealing with the issue mentioned above.
 It clarified,
 "The entire endeavour of the exercise is that some sort of workable mechanism is put in motion to ensure the protection of life and personal liberty as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Further that only in exceptional cases, the couples have to take trouble to approach this Court alleging infringement of the rights."
 The observation was made while hearing a criminal writ petition filed by a runaway couple, apprehending that they may be eliminated by their families.
 Findings
 At the outset, the Single Bench observed that a large number of such petitions are being filed by the couples who performed marriage against the wishes of their parents and relatives.
 "Over the period it is experienced that number of such petitions are filed as a matter of routine. It is evident from most of these petitions that the day the marriage is performed, a representation is made and in some cases even the writ petition is drafted/filed on the same very day. In most of the cases, there is even no proof of submission of the representation," the Bench noted.
 It further observed that the petitions of such nature are either disposed of, without commenting on the validity of the marriage and directing the official respondents to consider the representation or notice of motion is issued to the official respondents. 
 "In latter case by the next date, the police officials record the statements of the petitioners. By and large the statement is that there is no threat perception existing. The net result is that the petitions involving real serious and eminent threat get mixed up in number of petitions filed in routine," it added while contemplating a proper mechanism to deal with such cases.
 At this juncture, the Court also expressed displeasure at the fact that the directions issued by the High Court to all the District & Sessions Judges in the two States (in Asha & Anr. v. State of Haryana & Ors., vide order dated March 31, 2010) for granting interim protection to such couples, are not being complied with.
 As a result, the Bench noted, the couples who are apprehending threat perception have to travel all the way to this Court for completing the formalities for filing the writ petition, this further exposes them to threat.
 Submissions
 Dr. Mandeep Mittal, Additional Secretary, Punjab State Legal Services Authority informed the High Court that in Punjab, there are one stop centre (Sakhi Centre) for women victims, being run by Health and Family Welfare Department, Punjab under the supervision of Deputy Commissioner of each district. 
 The Court suggested that it would be appropriate that the scope of working of these centres be enhanced and their services be utilised for dealing with the issues of such couples.
 The matter is now fixed for March 22, 2021.

The Supreme Court has held that a clause in an agreement barring payment of interest on amounts security deposit, earnest money deposit or any other amount will not be hit by Section 28 of the Contract Act.
 According to Section 28 of the Indian Contract Act, a contract is void to the extent it restricts absolutely a party from enforcing his rights by usual proceedings in ordinary courts or if it limits the time within which he may enforce his rights. Exception I to this section contains a rule that a contract by which two or more persons agree that any dispute which has arisen or which may arise between them in respect of any subject or class of subjects shall be referred to arbitration is not illegal. 
The case(Garg Builders Vs Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited LL 2021 SC 535) before the Supreme Court was related to the right of a party to seek pendente lite interest in an arbitration proceeding when the agreement had a clause barring the agreement.
An argument was raised that the clause barring interest was violative of Section 28 of the Contract Act. Answering this issue, the Court noted that the payment of interest is governed by the Interest Act, 1978. The provisions of Section 3 (3) of the Interest Act, 1978 explicitly allows the parties to waive their claim to an interest by virtue of an agreement. Section 3(3)(a)(ii) states that the Interest Act will not apply to situations where the payment of interest is "barred by virtue of an express agreement".
In this backdrop, the Court held that the clause in question was not violative of Section 28.
A bench comprising Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari observed in the judgment as follows :
"20. Exception I to Section 28 saves contracts where the right to move the Court for appropriate relief is restricted but where the parties have agreed to resolve their dispute through arbitration. Thus, a lawful agreement to refer the matter to arbitration can be made a condition precedent before going to courts and it does not violate Section 28. No cause of action then accrues until the Arbitrator has made the award and the only amount awarded in such arbitration is recoverable in respect of the dispute so referred. Section 31(7)(a) of the 1996 Act which allows parties to waive any claim to interest including pendente lite and the power of the Arbitrator to grant interest is subject to the agreement of the parties.
 
21. It is pertinent to note that interest payments are governed in general by the Interest Act, 1978 in addition to the specific statutes that govern an impugned matter. Section 2 (a) of the Interest Act defines a "Court" which includes both a Tribunal and an Arbitrator. In turn, Section 3 allows a "Court" to grant interest at prevailing interest rates in various cases. The provisions of Section 3 (3) of the Interest Act, 1978 explicitly allows the parties to waive their claim to an interest by virtue of an agreement. Section 3(3)(a)(ii) states that the Interest Act will not apply to situations where the payment of interest is "barred by virtue of an express agreement".
 22. Thus, when there is an express statutory permission for the parties to contract out of receiving interest and they have done so without any vitiation of free consent, it is not open for the Arbitrator to grant pendent lite interest. We are of the considered opinion that Clause 17 of the contract is not ultra vires in terms of Section 28 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872".

The Supreme Court set aside an interim order passed by the Madras High Court in a writ petition filed by some broadcasters/FM Radios challenging Rule 29(4) of Copyright Rules, 2013.
"Craftsmanship on the judicial side cannot transgress into the legislative domain by re-writing the words of a statute. For then, the judicial craft enters the forbidden domain of a legislative draft.", the bench of Justice DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna observed in the case Saregama India Limited vs. Next Radio Limited & Ors.
Copyright Rules
Section 31D deals with statutory licence for broadcasting of literary and musical works and sound recording.  
Under sub-section (1) of Section 31D, a broadcasting organization which is desirous of communicating to the public by way of a broadcast or performance of a literary or musical work and sound recording which has already been published, may do so subject to compliance of five requirements, namely: (i) a prior notice; (ii) in the manner prescribed; (iii) of the intention to broadcast the work; (iv) stating the duration and territorial coverage of the broadcast; and (v) payment to the owner of rights in each work royalties in the manner and at the rate fixed by the Appellate Board.
Rule 29 deals with the notice to owner for communication to the public of literary and musical works and sound recordings. Sub clause (4) provides that the notice shall contain the following particulars: (a) Name of the channel; (b) Territorial coverage where communication to public by way of radio broadcast, television broadcast or performance under sub-rule (3) is to be made; (c) Details necessary to identify the work which is proposed to be communicated to the public by way of radio broadcast, television broadcast or performance under sub-rule (3); (d) Year of publication of such work, if any; (e) Name, address and nationality of the owner of the copyright in such works; (f) Names of authors and principal performers of such works; (g) Alterations, if any, which are proposed to be made for the communication to the public by way of radio broadcast, television broadcast or performance 
Challenge to the validity of Rule 29(4)
Before the Madras High Court, the validity of Rule 29(4) was challenged by certain broadcasters/ FM Radio on the ground that it (i) violates Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution; and (ii) is ultra vires Section 31D of the Act. The High Court, in its interim order observed that the duty which is cast on broadcasters in the notice to broadcast under Rule 29(1) is "apparently onerous". 
"Prima facie, there appears to be an element of unworkability about the Rule in that it may be seen to be almost claustrophobic in its operation and leaving very little room for flexibility. Indeed, the very concept of speaking or performing ad lib, which is the essence of spontaneity in any live speech or live performance, would be lost if pre-planned details, down to the every second of the programme must be disclosed as the impugned Rule may be read to imply",  the High Court had observed.
The High Court had issued the following directions:
(i) No copyrighted work may be broadcast in terms of Rule 29 without issuing a prior notice; ii) Details pertaining to the broadcast, particularly the duration, time slots and the like, including the quantum of royalty payable may be furnished within fifteen days of the broadcast or performance; (iii) Compliance be effected with a modified regime of post facto, as opposed to prior compliance mandated by Rule 29(4) and the statutory mandate of a twenty four hour prior notice shall be substituted by a provision for compliance within fifteen days after the broadcast; (iv) The interim order will be confined to the petitioners before the High Court and the copyrighted works of the second and third respondents which are sought to be exploited.
Appeal before Apex Court
Before the Apex Court, challenging this interim order, it was contended that the interim order amounts to re-writing Rule 29(4) of the Rules framed in pursuance of the provisions of Section 31D and Section 78(2)(cD) of the Copyright Act 1957. The court noted that the High Court has substituted the provisions of Rule 29(4) with a regime of its own, which is made applicable to the broadcasters and the petitioners before it. The court made the following observations:
Craftsmanship on the judicial side cannot transgress into the legislative domain by re-writing the words of a statute
"21. The court is entrusted by the Constitution of the power of judicial review. In the discharge of its mandate, the court may evaluate the validity of a legislation or rules made under it. A statute may be invalidated if is ultra vires constitutional guarantees or transgresses the legislative domain entrusted to the enacting legislature. Delegated legislation can, if it results in a constitutional infraction or is contrary to the ambit of the enacting statute be invalidated. However, the court in the exercise of judicial review cannot supplant the terms of the provision through judicial interpretation by re-writing statutory language. Draftsmanship is a function entrusted to the legislature. Craftsmanship on the judicial side cannot transgress into the legislative domain by re-writing the words of a statute. For then, the judicial craft enters the forbidden domain of a legislative draft. That precisely is what the Division Bench of the High Court has done by its interim order.", the court observed.
An exercise of judicial redrafting of legislation or delegated legislation cannot be carried out.
21....Section 31D(2) speaks of the necessity of giving prior notice, in the manner as may be prescribed, of the intention to broadcast the work stating the duration and the territorial coverage of the broadcast, together with the payment of royalties in the manner and at the rates fixed by the Appellate Board. While the High Court has held the broadcasters down to the requirement of prior notice, it has modified the operation of Rule 29 by stipulating that the particulars which are to be furnished in the notice may be furnished within a period of fifteen days after the broadcast. The interim order converts the second proviso into a "routine procedure" instead of an exception (as the High Court has described its direction). This exercise by the High Court amounts to re-writing. Such an exercise of judicial redrafting of legislation or delegated legislation cannot be carried out. The High Court has done so at the interlocutory stage."
The court observed that an exercise of judicial re-drafting of Rule 29(4) was unwarranted, particularly at the interlocutory stage.
22...We are of the view that an exercise of judicial re-writing of a statutory rule is unwarranted in the exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, particularly in interlocutory proceedings. The High Court was also of the view that the second proviso may be resorted to as a matter of routine, instead of as an exception and that the ex post facto reporting should be enlarged to a period of fifteen days (instead of a period of twenty four hours). Such an exercise was impermissible since it would substitute a statutory rule made in exercise of the power of delegated legislation with a new regime and provision which the High Court considers more practicable.", the court said while allowing the appeal.
The court clarified that it has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the rival submissions regarding validity of Rule 29(4).

The Allahabad High Court has observed that the Precarious financial condition of a corporation can not be a ground to delay payment of pensionary benefits that are due to superannuated employees.
The Bench of Justice Irshad Ali made this observation on a plea filed by one Shiv Kumar Bahadur Singh who sought direction upon the Government authorities to make payment of him a full amount of gratuity to along with interest in view of the amended provisions of Section 4 of Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.
Essentially, the petitioner is a Class III Government employee. The opposite parties admitted to making payment of the complete amount of gratuity and also paid Rs.19,200/- in the month of May, 2021, but, as per the counsel for the petitioner, since then, the remaining amount of Rs.3.06 lacs and statutory interest accrued thereon was still due. 
It was next submitted that the opposite party had indicated a condition that due to the precarious financial condition of the corporation, payment to the petitioner would be made in the future whenever the funds are available.
The counsel for the petitioner submitted that the gratuity amount of an employee like the petitioner is not a bounty to be distributed at the sweet will of the employer and that the petitioner has a vested right to be paid his gratuity amount within a reasonable time from the date of superannuation. 
On the other hand, the counsel for the opposite parties reiterated the fact that while the corporation admits its liability towards payment of pensionary benefits of the petitioner, the same can not be paid instantly in view of the precarious financial condition of the corporation whenever the funds are available with the corporation.
Having heard the counsel for the petitioners, the Court observed that it is settled law that the pensionary benefits are not a bounty to be distributed at the sweet will of the employer. In this regard, the Court referred to the case of D.S. Nakara versus Union of India AIR 1983 Supreme Court Cases 130. 
Similarly, the Court also referred to the case of Kapila Hingorani versus the State of Bihar (2003) 6 SCC 1, wherein the Supreme Court had held that the precarious financial condition of the employer is not a valid ground for delaying or not making payment of pensionary benefits of a superannuated employee
In view of the aforesaid facts, the opposite parties were directed to make payment of the outstanding gratuity amount of the petitioners within a period of four months and that grant of interest to the petitioner be also considered by the opposite parties within the same time period. Consequently, the writ petition was allowed at the admission stage itself.

The Madras High Court has recently issued a set of directions for the movement of bio medical waste. The court was hearing a plea filed by a company which was engaged in the business of collecting and disposing bio medical waste in five districts namely Madurai, Virudhunagar, Theni, Dindigul and Ramanathapuram.
The company had approached the court when a group of villagers restricted entry of the company vehicles after a plastic pocket containing amputated limb had fallen on the road in transit. Following this, a peace committee meeting was convened including revenue and police authorities. The company was directed to take a different route and its license was to be renewed only after ascertaining views of villagers.
 Justice GR Swaminathan, however criticised the manner in which the villagers had restricted the company. The court noted that the right to carry on business was guaranteed under Article 19(1) (g) of the constitution and the mob could not hold a person at ransom. 
 It has recently been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the rights under Articles 19 and 21 can find horizontal application also. In other words, they can be invoked even against private individuals. We are a democracy governed by rule of law. A mob cannot hold any person even a disliked business entity to ransom.
 The court also noted that the decisions taken by the peace committee did not have any statutory value or force and did not have the character of a binding decision. Though the revenue authorities and police were responsible for maintaining law and order, the same would be binding if the procedure set out in the CrPC was followed. Thus, there was no need for directions forbearing the respondents to give effect to the decisions taken in the peace meeting as the same did not have any legal value.
 With respect to the company’s prayer for free access through the public road, the court noted that a balance had to be struck between the company’s right to carry on business and the villagers right to clean environment. The villagers had already complained that that running of the unit was posing serious health hazards. Since these issues could not be brushed aside, the court found it necessary to issue certain directions to the company for carrying Biomedical waste.
 Firstly, the court noted that healthcare facilities needed to be registered online and each healthcare facility was to be given a login id to enable online payment. There must be transparency in fee collection to ensure timely service by the waste management provider. 
 The court also directed that biomedical waste should be collected every 48 hours. While collection, the company should have adequate vehicles and staff and the vehicles must conform to requisite norms. The transportation should be done in closed vehicles, without overstuffing and by maintaining highest transportation standards.
 The court added that there should be fixed dates and timings for collection and the drivers must be trained to pay due care to avoid hazard to general public. To ensure proper monitoring and regulation, the court also directed that barcode scanning be introduced to track online via app as prescribed by the pollution control guidelines 2016. It was also suggested that the company give colour coded collection bags to ensure proper segregation. 
 The court also called for setting up a Grievance cell by the State Pollution Control Board to ensure complaints by the general public are addressed expeditiously. 
 The court also noted that in the present case, the polluter pays principle is to be applied and the company would be made liable if any similar incident happens in the future.
 Case Title: M/s.Re Sustainability Health Care Solutions Ltd v. The District Collector and others

The Bombay High Court on Friday acquitted Guddu Krish Yadav who was sentenced to death penalty by the Palghar sessions court in 2015 for the double murder of a colleague and his wife by allegedly pouring acid on the sleeping couple as revenge for reporting theft by Yadav to their employer.
 The High Court was hearing a death confirmation petition filed by the state government as a death sentence awarded by a sessions court has to be confirmed by the High Court before it can be executed. 
A Division bench of Justices Sadhana S Jadhav and Milind N Jadhav rejected the death confirmation plea, observing that the trial was conducted in the "most casual manner" and the prosecution had "suppressed and fabricated vital evidence". 
 "After having appreciated the entire evidence on record, the material discrepancies, lacunae and blatant illegalities, we would definitely indicate that the prosecution has utterly failed in connecting the dots and bringing home the guilt of the accused. Merely because the crime is heinous and brutal, it would not be just to get carried away sans any legal proof required to substantiate the charge of murder on the accused," the bench said.
 According to the prosecution, on November 5, 2015, Yadav allegedly stole his colleague's phone, who then complained to their employer. Consequently, the employer pulled up Yadav and asked him to return the phone. This allegedly caused Yadav to seek revenge. In the wee hours of November 6, 2015, Yadav allegedly went to the company's quarters – where his colleague stayed with his wife – with a bucket of concentrated sulphuric acid and poured the same on them while they were asleep. The couple was taken to the hospital, where the husband died four hours later and the wife the next day.
 The police relied on dying declarations of the couple and two other employees who were key eye witnesses to the incident. The Palghar sessions court, on May 9, 2019, convicted Yadav and sentenced him to death observing that the same was "a unique case beyond imagination and a crime of such a nature, which is undeserving of any sympathy or mercy". 
 Thereafter, the state government had moved the High Court seeking confirmation of Yadav's death sentence. Yadav argued that as per material on record, there was major discrepancy and contradiction about the time of the deaths and thus, the dying declarations cannot be admitted as evidence.
 The court noted that it was amply clear after going through the evidence of the doctor and the nurse who first attended the murdered couple that they were not conscious enough to record a dying declaration.
 The bench noted that "the evidence led by the prosecution is fraught with major inconsistencies… The trial was conducted in the most casual manner and whether it was just and fair in a capital punishment case is a question remaining unanswered. The quality and credibility of the evidence adduced is not even up to the mark…". 
 Referring to the Supreme court case of Ashish Batham Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 2002 Supreme Court 3206, wherein it was held that charges must be proved beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of clear, cogent, credible or unimpeachable evidence and the question of indicting or punishing an accused does not arise, merely carried away by heinous nature of the crime or the gruesome manner in which it was found to have been committed, the bench came to the unequivocal conclusion that the prosecution has not only suppressed vital evidence but deliberately fabricated the dying declaration of the deceased, which forms the basis of its case. Yadav was thus acquitted.

The Madras High Court recently remarked that information technology today is posing a great challenge in upbringing of teenagers, whose minds are often affected by easily accessible pornography, misleading them and making them indulge in sexual offences without understanding its consequences.
 The Madurai bench of Justice J Nisha Banu and Justice N Anand Venkatesh emphasized that whenever these teenagers are arrested, efforts should be made to attend to their mental perversity. The court thus observed as under:
 The teanagers, who are easily exposed to pornography even from their mobile phones, get confused and mislead at an age where they are in the grips of hormonal changes and they indulge in activities without understanding its consequences. Once these teanagers are arrested and kept inside the prison, efforts must be taken to attend to their mental perversion. The purpose of confining a teanager in the prison is not to abandon him and throw him out of the main stream of the society and all steps must be taken to reform such a person.
 The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by the father of 18 years old boy who was detained by the District Collector, holding him to be "Sexual Offender" under Section 2(ggg) of the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Cyber Law offenders, Drug Offenders, Forest Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders, Sand Offenders, Sexual Offenders, Slum-Grabbers and Video Pirates Act 1982.
 The order of the District Collector was challenged on the ground that there was gross violation of procedural safeguards as the representation made by the petitioner was not considered on time and there was inordinate and unexplained delay. It was submitted that there was a delay of 5 days in submitting the remarks by the  Detaining Authority and a delay of 21 days in considering the representation. 
 The State, however, submitted that though there was a delay in considering the representation, no prejudice has been caused to the detenue and thus there was no violation of fundamental rights under Article 21 and 22 of the Constitution.
 The court was convinced that there was inordinate and unexplained delay. In view of the decision of the Supreme Court and the Madras High Court emphasising on procedural safeguards and holding detention to be illegal whenever there was inordinate delay, the court was incline to quash the impugned detention order. 
 It also suggested the State Government to up with some mechanism whereby, offenders of this nature are properly counselled when they are in prison and when they come out of the prison, they are reformed and they are able to lead a normal life.

The Tripura High Court recently granted judicial separation to an old couple on humanitarian grounds, stating that they have mutually agreed to be away from each other and the court would not want to precipitate the litigation.
 The observation came from a division bench of Justice T. Amarnath Goud & Justice S.G. Chattopadhyay:
 "After elaborate arguments on behalf of both sides, both the parties present in court have mutually consented to be away from each other in view of their domestic issues and prays for judicial separation for some period. As the parties are senior citizens and considering their case on special reasons and having humanitarian grounds not to precipitate the litigation and with a hope in future they will have better days this court is of the view that for granting judicial separation which would be appropriate instead of divorce."
 The respondent-husband as a petitioner instituted divorce petition before Family Court against the appellant-wife for decree of divorce and for dissolution of their marriage mainly on the ground that the appellant by filing criminal proceeding treated the respondent with cruelty. He alleged that the appellant became indifferent towards domestic works and could not adjust with the family members and started to behave roughly and rudely with the respondent and his sons.
The appellant had contested the matrimonial proceeding and levelled cross allegations of cruelty and harassment with regard to maintenance.
After trial, the Family Court passed a judgment granting decree of divorce in favour of the respondent, against which the instant appeal was preferred by the Appellant.
The High Court set aside the divorce decree and instead, granted judicial separation.
Case Title: Smti. Pramila Ghosh (Guha) Versus Sri Anup Kumar Guha

The Karnataka High Court has said that a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, seeking to quash conviction handed down to an accused under the Negotiable Instruments Act is not maintainable.
Petitioner Vuppalapti Satish Kumar had approached the court seeking to quash the conviction handed down to him on 2.1.2023, for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. 
The office (Registry) raised an objection regarding maintainability of the petition as the petitioner being the accused convicted in the trial court, required to file an appeal under section 374 of Cr.P.C.
The counsel appearing for the petitioner contended that the criminal petition filed under section 482 of Cr.P.C is maintainable, even though the statutory right of the accused for filing appeal is available.
Reliance was placed on the Supreme Court judgment in the case of Punjab State Warehousing Corporation Faridkot Vs Shree Durga Ji Traders and Ors reported in (2011) 14 SCC 615 and in case of Vijay and another Vs State of Maharashtra and Anr reported in (2017) 13 SCC 317. 
Further it was contended that the trial court convicted the accused No.2, who is only Managing Director of the company but acquitted the accused No.1 who is the Company. Therefore, there is an error committed by the trial court in acquitting the Company from the charges and convicting only the Managing Director, which is against the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in various cases, it was argued. 
A single judge bench of Justice K Natarajan noted the law laid down by the Supreme Court in respect of quashing the FIR and said,
“This court entertaining 482 of Cr.P.C, where there is no evidence led by the parties and there is no final judgment of conviction or acquittal after the trial in those cases. Therefore, the High Court can entertain Section 482 of Cr.P.C, if the complaint is dismissed for non-prosecution or dismissed for default under section 256 of Cr.P.C.” 
Following which it held “The present case on hand, the petitioner is challenging the conviction and sentence passed by the trial court by exercising the power under section 255 of Cr.P.C. Therefore, the petitioner is required to file appeal under section 374 (2) of Cr.P.C before the Sessions Judge, where the first appellate court required to re-appreciate evidence on record and pass the final judgment and thereafter the aggrieved parties can approach high court under section 397 of Cr.P.C, if any concurrent finding of both the Court below.” 
It added “This Court cannot re-appreciate the evidence on record, both on facts and law, which is required to be dealt with by the appellate court in the appeal under Section 374 of Cr.P.C. This Court cannot re-appreciate any evidence on record and give findings, it is only extraordinary power for quashing the proceedings, since the first appeal is nothing but continuation of original proceedings in appellate court.” 
Thus it expressed “If this petition filed under section 482 of Cr.P.C, is entertained, the respondent will be deprived of right of appeal before the appellate court and thereafter parties can approach the High Court.” 
Finally it remarked “It appears the accused are following these back door tactics in order to avoid the interim compensation going to be imposed by the first appellate court under section 148 of NI Act.” 
Accordingly it dismissed the petition.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court last week observed that a sanction order (for prosecution) is a public document within the meaning of Section 74(1) (iii) of the Indian Evidence Act and therefore, the certified copy prepared of the same under Section 76/77 of the Evidence Act is admissible in evidence.
 The Bench of Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan observed thus as it set aside an order passed by ACJM, Bhiwani (Haryana) summoning the then-District Magistrate, Bhiwani to appear as a witness to formally prove a sanction order passed by him.
 The case in brief 
 An FIR was registered against the accused under Section 25 of the Arms Act in a Police Station in District Bhiwani on charges of keeping in possession a country-made pistol of .315 bore, along with 8 live cartridges without having any permit or license. 
 Since it is a requirement under the Arms Act that before prosecuting the accused in such a matter, a sanction for prosecution should be obtained from the concerned District Magistrate, who is the competent authority, therefore, in the instant matter too, the sanction for prosecution was taken from the District Magistrate. 
 The said sanction order was attached along with the report submitted under Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. and the Reader to the District Magistrate, Bhiwani was cited as a witness in the list of witnesses so that the said sanction order can be formally proved by the Reader of the District Magistrate.
 However, without there being any application by the respondent-accused or any request by the State, the ACJM, Bhiwani suo motu ordered that instead of Reader to the District Magistrate, the DM himself be added the list of witnessed and be summoned to prove the sanction order.
 Challenging this order, the State moved to the High Court and argued that the sanction order is a public document under Section 74(1)(iii) of the Evidence Act and therefore, it can be proved by the Reader to District Magistrate, being a public document as per Section 78 of the Evidence Act.
 After hearing learned counsel for the parties, the Court found merit in the petition for the following reasons: - 
 Neither there was any application by the accused nor by the State and, therefore, the Trial Court was not justified in suo motu substituting witness No.9-Reader to the District Magistrate, Bhiwani with District Magistrate, Bhiwani himself. The Reader to District Magistrate, Bhiwani was cited as a witness only to prove the sanction granted by the District Magistrate, Bhiwani, being a public document. Since the Reader will bring the original record for the perusal of the Court as well as for the defence counsel, who will have a right to cross-examine this witness for the reasoning given in the order and material available on record forming basis of granting sanction there is no justification in summoning the District Magistrate himself. Even otherwise the sanction order is a public document under Section 74(1) (iii) of the Indian Evidence Act and the certified copy prepared under Section 76/77 of the Evidence Act, is admissible in evidence. 
 In view of the above, this petition was allowed and the impugned orders dated 31.10.2017 and 21.11.2017 passed by the ACJM, Bhiwani were set aside. The trial court was asked to proceed further by summoning witness No.9, i.e. Reader to the District Magistrate, Bhiwani for recording the evidence
Case title : State of Haryana v. Asman and another and connected matter
Case citation:  (PH) 43

The Kerala High Court recently said that when an original petition is converted to a suit as contemplated under Rule 26 of the Indian Succession Rules (Kerala), 1968, the court fee has to be paid under Article 11 (k) of Schedule II of the Court Fees Act. 
A trial court had earlier directed a plaintiff to pay court fees under Section 25(a) of the Act read with Article 1 Schedule I of the Court Fees Act, even after conversion of original petition to suit. However, Justice C.S. Dias said the same is incorrect and wrong.
The court said Chapter VI of the Kerala Court-Fees and Suits Valuation Act, 1959 deals with the manner in which court fee is to be computed and paid on applications filed for probate, letter of administration and certificate of administration.
"The above provisions clearly specify that whenever an application for the grant of probate or letters of administration is filed, the same has to be accompanied by a valuation statement of the estate in the form set forth in Part I of Schedule III of the Court Fees Act, and court fee is to be paid under Article 6 of Schedule I of the Court Fees Act," it added.
However, the court added that whenever there is a contest, the court fee is to be paid under Article 11 (k) of Schedule II of the Court Fees Act. 
"So, in an uncontested application falling under Section 56 of the Court Fees Act, the court fee is to be paid under Article 6 of Schedule I of the Act and in a contested application, the court fee is to be paid under Article 11 (k) of Schedule II of the Act, i.e., one half of the scale of fees prescribed under Article 1 of Schedule I of the Court Fees Act".
Senior Advocate N.N. Sugunapalan and Advocate S. Sujin appeared on behalf of the petitioners. The respondents were represented by Advocates Legith T. Kottakkal and Kodoth Sreedharan. 
Case Title: K.G. Sunilkrishnan v. K.G. Premsankar 

In a significant order, the Allahabad High Court has directed the Sessions Courts throughout the state to make an endeavor to complete the examination of the private witnesses, both chief, and cross, on the same day, as far as possible.
The Bench of Justice Vikas Kunvar Srivastav and Justice Sunita Agarwal further directed the trial judges in the state to take up the examination of the private witnesses first, before proceeding with that of the official witnesses.
"This approach is needed to ensure fair and proper trial which is the duty of the trial Court and also to curb the menace where the private witnesses turned hostile for obvious reasons because of long adjournments, permitting an act of maneuvering," the Court added as it referred to the Apex Court's recent ruling in the case of Rajesh Yadav vs State of UP  (SC) 137.
The case in brief 
Essentially, the Court was hearing an appeal filed by the Murder Convict (one Ram Chandra) against the judgment and order of 1989 passed by the Special/Additional Sessions Judge, Shahjahanpur, whereby he had been sentenced to life imprisonment.
The case pertained to the murder of one Laraiti by the appellant-convict on account of enmity due to the ongoing civil litigation between the parties. The first informant (PW-1) was the husband of the deceased. The prosecution sought to rely on three witnesses (PW1, PW2 and PW3)
The Court, having perused the case record, noted that the examination-in-chief of PW-1 was recorded by the Presiding judge on May 2, 1989, and he was cross-examined to some extent, however, without completion of his cross-examination, the Judicial Officer concerned had proceeded to record the statement of other witnesses of fact namely PW-2 and PW-3 on the same day.
The Court further noted that the cross-examination of PW-3 was concluded on that very day i.e., May 2, 1989, however, the cross-examinations of PW-1 and PW2 were not completed by the Court concerned. Significantly, on May 2, 1989 itself, PW-2 & PW-3 both were declared hostile. 
The Court also noted in its order that three prosecution witnesses of facts (PW1, PW2, and PW3) were examined on the same day, i.e. on May 2, 1989, but not in the correct order of examination.
Importantly, after more than two months, i.e. on July 20, 1989, when the case was taken up for cross-examination of the remaining witnesses, i.e. PW-1 and PW-2, it was transpired that PW-1 Puttu (First informant/husband of the deceased) had died a month before.
Court's observations
At the outset, the Court noted that as per the settled law, the evidence of a hostile witness cannot be discarded as a whole, relevant parts thereof which are admissible in law can be used by the prosecution or the defence.
Now, against this backdrop, the Court analyzed the evidence/testimonies of PW-2 & PW-3 (who had turned hostile) and observed that nothing could be elicited in favor of the prosecution case from the statement of PW-3 who had turned hostile and completely retracted from his previous statement and therefore, the court discarded his statement in toto. However, the Court relied on certain parts of the testimony of PW-2, which supported the case of the prosecution. 
Regarding the examination of the prosecution witnesses, which was not done chronologically, the Court remarked thus:
"It is not understandable nor acceptable that the trial Judge had proceeded to record the statement of PW-3 without completing the testimony of PW-1 and PW-2 in the chronological order...It seems from the record of the instant case that the defence had succeeded in manipulating the trial Judge who had recorded statements of the witnesses of fact and in order to frustrate the case of the prosecution, the testimony of PW-1 and PW-2 was not completed on the first date, i.e. 2.5.1989. Nothing could be discerned about the role of the prosecuting officer after such a long time as we are deciding the case of the year 1989 in the year 2022. However, this much can be concluded that the trial Judge who had recorded the statements of the prosecution witnesses of fact (PW-1 to PW-3) did not act fairly. The right of the parties, whether defence or the prosecution, for a fair trial has been seriously hampered in the present case." 
Further, the Court read the statement of PW-1 and PW-2 (certain parts of his testimony were found to be reliable) conjointly to come to the conclusion that the case of the prosecution was found proved as to the mode and manner of occurrence and the involvement of accused Ram Chandra. 
The Court further noted that other supporting evidence from the record, i.e. medical evidence also corroborated the ocular version of PW-1, the injuries caused on the person of the deceased, which were the cause of her death. 
In light of the above discussion, considering the attending circumstances of the case and the motive with which the accused-appellant committed the murder of the deceased, the Court concluded that there was no infirmity in the decision of the trial court in convicting the accused-appellant for the offence of murder under Section 302 IPC.
However, before parting with the case, having regard to the facts of the case and as to how the examination of the witnesses had taken place, the Court directed that the Apex Court's ruling in the case of Rajesh Yadav be circulated amongst all the trial Judges in the State of U.P. by the Registrar General, High Court, Allahabad.
Case title - Ram Chandra v. State [CRIMINAL APPEAL No. - 1862 of 1989]

The Allahabad High Court recently observed that at the stage of adjudicating a bail application, it cannot delve into the quality or quantity of evidence and it can only consider whether the delinquent appears to have committed the crime and whether he is entitled to bail or not.
 With this, the bench of Justice Krishan Pahal denied bail to a man who has been accused of killing his wife pursuant to setting her on fire. It was argued by the defence counsel that many prosecution witnesses had not supported the case of the prosecution.
 Significantly, in its order, the Court also gave weightage to the dying declaration recorded by the ASI as it did not find a lacuna in the recording of the dying declaration by a police officer.
 In fact, in this regard, the Court referred to a Supreme Court’s ruling in the case of Betal Singh vs. State of MP (1996) SCC (Cri) 624, wherein it was categorically held that in a case of Bride burning, the Dying declaration recorded by a police officer, can be acted upon if the same is found to be true, coherent, consistent, and free from any effort to prompt the deceased to make such a statement. 
 “From the perusal of both the statements aka ‘dying declarations’ it transpires that the contents are almost the same although the ASI has recorded it in vernacular Hindi and the treating doctors have done so in English. There is nothing on record to suggest that the police or the treating doctors had any animosity with the applicant. The investigating officer has fairly exonerated the accused who were although named in FIR, but their names were not mentioned in the statements of the deceased person that tantamount to dying declaration. A presumption of fair action at the part of police and the treating doctors must arise here,” the Court observed as it denied bail to the applicant-accused.
 The case in brief
Essentially, in the instant case, the accused (husband of the deceased) has been accused of killing his own wife pursuant to subjecting her to cruelty on demands of dowry.
 Seeking bail in the case, the counsel for the accused argued that the dying declaration in the instant case was recorded by ASI which indicated that the applicant had sprinkled some liquid on the deceased person and set her afire. 
 Objecting to the recording of the dying declaration by a police officer, it was further submitted that the said dying declaration is not admissible under the Indian Evidence Act as it has not been recorded as per law. 
 Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicant to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations made against him.
 On the other hand, the state’s counsel argued that it has nowhere been stated by the prosecution that the statement recorded by the ASI is a dying declaration and that merely it has been stated that the said statement before ASI and even before 2 treating doctors, tantamount to dying declaration as they have been duly recorded by them during the course of their official duty.
 It was also submitted that the said statements recorded by ASI at the Hospital had been taken in Hindi and that by the doctor, the same was recorded in English and that there are no material inconsistencies in the said dying declarations.
 Against this backdrop, after hearing the counsel for the parties, going through the evidence on record, and also taking into consideration the fact that a young lady had been set to fire by the applicant within the precincts of the place they both used to live, the Court did not find it a fit case for grant of bail to the applicant.
 However, looking at the period of detention of the applicant, it was directed that the case pending before the trial court be decided expeditiously, preferably within a period of one year.

Taking note of the large pendency and lack of a uniform method for prioritisation of cases in the district consumer forums, the Delhi High Court has issued directions for ensuring expeditious disposal of the consumer matters
Justice Pratibha M Singh directed the Registrars of concerned district forums to start listing final matters, where evidence has been concluded, for hearing at 2:30 PM on a daily basis, with effect from November 14. 
The matters shall be listed in a chronological manner starting from the oldest cases first, the court said, adding that an advance publication shall be made in the cause list so that the lawyers and litigants are duly informed.
The court also directed that monthly reports shall be submitted by the concerned Registrars to the Registrar General of the High Court regarding the status of disposal of the final matters.
Justice Singh also ordered that a meeting be held on November 10 in the chamber of its Registrar General on various issues, including providing requisite infrastructure and feasibility for creation of mediation cells in all the district consumer forums. 
The court said the meeting be attended by President or member of District Consumer Disputes Redressal forums, Registrar of Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Secretary of Ministry of Delhi Government's Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Additional Standing Counsels Satyakam and Sameer Vashisht, the counsel of the petitioner and officials who had conducted inspection of various district forums. 
"Let the conclusion/minutes of the meeting be placed before this Court on or before 22nd November, 2022. List on 22nd November, 2022 at 2:30 pm," the court said. 
Earlier, the court had sought a report from its Registrar General on the status of working hours of the forums, taking note of a huge pendency of cases in district fora as well as the State Consumer Forum. 
It had also noted that it was expected that physical courts ought to resume quickly in such fora and that some priority must be given to old matters where the evidence was concluded and were pending for final hearing.
As per an earlier report submitted by the Registrar, Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, there were a total 725 cases pending for final hearing before the State Commission and 6,834 number of cases pending for final hearing before various District Fora. In all these cases, evidence was stated to have been concluded.
Regarding infrastructural support, the report stated that there was an acute shortage of space and support staff in the State and the District Fora.
The Court was dealing with a petition highlighting a grievance that the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (West), Janakpuri, Delhi had not disposed of the consumer complaint, which was filed way back in 2007.
The Court had then called for a report on the aspect of vacancies in respect of staff and members at the said consumer forum and also on the urgent requirements for its effective functioning.

The Supreme Court has observed that it is not obligatory on the part of the Court to issue a fully reasoned order for taking cognizance on the basis of a police report(Case : Pradeep S Wodeyar versus Union of India). A bench comprising Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice Vikram Nath and Justice BV Nagarathna was deciding an appeal filed against a judgment of the Karnataka High Court which dismissed the appellant's petition seeking quashing of the criminal proceedings against him.The appellant, a Managing Director of a company, was facing criminal trial for offences related to unauthorized mining under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act and Indian Penal Code.
One of the argument raised by the appellant was that the order passed by the Special Judge under the MMDR Act to take cognizance was unsustainable in law as no reasons were recorded in it.  It was argued that the order of the Special Judge taking cognizance has not sufficiently demonstrated application of mind to the material placed before him. To substantiate this contention, the appellant relied on the decisions in Pepsi Foods Ltd. v. Special Judicial Magistrate (1998) 5 SCC 749, Fakhruddin Ahmad v. State of Uttaranchal (2008) 17 SCC 157, Mehmood Ul Rehman v. Khazir Mohammad Tunda (2015) 12 SCC 420, Sunil Bharti Mittal v. CBI (2015) 4 SCC 609.On the other hand, the State of Karnataka relied on the decision in State of Gujarat v. Afroz Mohammed Hasanafatta which laid down that Magistrate is not bound to record reasons if cognizance is taken on the basis of a police report. It was argued that there are different yardsticks for taking cognizance on the basis of a private complaint and one a police report. While there is a requirement to record reasons in the former case, it is not a mandatory requirement in the latter case, argued the State.The Supreme Court accepted the argument of the State. The Court noted that the most of the decision relied on by the appellant were cases arising out of private complaints. In Sunil Bharti Mittal, the Magistrate had issued summons to an accused who was not named in the charge-sheet. Therefore, the Supreme Court held that the Magistrate had to record reasons. However, in the instant case, the Special Judge took cognizance against the accused on the basis of a report filed by the Special Investigation Team."Though all the above judgments mention that the Magistrate needs to apply his mind to the materials placed before him before taking cognizance, they have been differentiated on facts from the present case as unlike the present case where cognizance was taken based on the SIT report, in those cases cognizance was taken based on a complaint", the Court observed.The Court also referred to the decision in Afroz Mohammed Hasanfatta which held that since in a case of cognizance based on a police report, the Magistrate has the advantage of perusing the materials, he is not required to record reasons."The Special Judge, it must be noted, took cognizance on the basis of a report submitted under Section 173 CrPC and not on the basis of a private complaint. Therefore, the case is squarely covered by the decision in Afroz Mohammed Hasanfatta (supra). The Special Judge took note of the FIR, the witness statements, and connected documents before taking cognizance of the offence. In this backdrop, it would be far-fetched to fault the order of the Special Judge on the ground that it does not adduce detailed reasons for taking cognizance or that it does not indicate that an application of mind. In the facts of this case, therefore, the order taking cognizance is not erroneous", the Court held in paragraph 75 of the judgment.In conclusion, the Court stated :"Since cognizance was taken by the Special Judge based on a police report and not a private complaint, it is not obligatory for the Special Judge to issue a fully reasoned order if it otherwise appears that the Special Judge has applied his mind to the material"Also from the judgment :  Irregularity In Order Taking Cognizance Will Not Vitiate Criminal Proceedings : Supreme Court 
Case Title : Pradeep S Wodeyar v State of Karnataka 
Appearances : Senior Advocates Siddharth Dave and Pravin H Parekh, for the appellant; Advocate Nikhil Goel for the State of Karnataka

The Kerala High Court on Friday held that a bank could not retain the security documents related to a mortgaged property if the loan amount has been paid in full by the borrower, merely because during term of the mortgage, it was alienated to a third party by the borrower. 
A single bench of Justice Shaji P Chaly held that : 
“merely because the property was transferred by the petitioner during the subsistence of the mortgage, however the interest of the Bank is protected by closing the loan account, the Bank is not entitled to withhold the security documents on the ground that the petitioner has transferred the property during the subsistence of the mortgage.” 
In the matter at hand, the petitioner had availed a housing loan from the State Bank of India which was later closed by the petitioner. However, when the petitioner asked the bank to release the security documents, including title deed of his property, the bank refused to do so. The bank informed the petitioner that his account was classified as fraud due to the alienation of his property without the permission of the Bank and hence legal action was being taken against him. The petitioner had approached the court challenging the action of the bank. 
The contention of the Bank was that that during the subsistence of the mortgage, the petitioner alienated a part of his property in favour of his wife. Later, by concealing the mortgage in favour SBI, a part of the property was also mortgaged to Kanayannur Taluk Co- operative Agriculture and Rural Development Bank and two more loans were availed by the petitioner. 
The court perused Sections 58 (Mortgage, mortgagor, mortgagee, mortgage-money and mortgage-deed defined) ,60-A (Obligation to transfer to third party instead of re-transference to mortgagor.) 83 (Power to deposit in Court money due on mortgage) and 91 (Persons who may sue for redemption.) of the transfer of property Act, 1882 to conclude that the bank was not entitled to retain the title deed of the petitioner, on account of alienation, when the loan had already been repaid to the bank. 
Holding the action of the bank to be illegal, the court observed that: 
“the Bank is not entitled to adjudicate an issue with respect to the fraud allegedly committed; and merely because the Bank initiates any action, the Bank is not entitled to detain the title documents and other security documents submitted by the petitioner before Bank. This is because the mortgage was created solely for the purpose of securing the loans, which was paid off by the petitioner. Therefore, if at all the bank suffered any loss consequent to the transfer of the property made by the petitioner, it has to be adjudicated by a competent court of law and not by the bank. Therefore, the unilateral action of the bank withholding the security document is an illegal and arbitrary action.” 
The court directed the bank to release the security documents furnished by the petitioner on account of the loan.

The Supreme Court observed that equivalence of prescribed qualifications with any other given qualification cannot be decided by the courts invoking its power of judicial review.
Equivalence of qualification is a matter for the State, as recruiting authority, to determine, the court said.
The bench comprising Justices S. Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari set aside a High Court judgment which held that the diploma/degree in Art and Craft given by the Kurukshetra University is equivalent to two-year Diploma in Art and Craft examination conducted by the Haryana Industrial Training Department or diploma in Art and Craft conducted by Director, Industrial Training and Vocational Education, Haryana.
In this case, one of the criteria of eligibility read thus: (ii) Two year Diploma in Art and Craft examination conducted by the Haryana Industrial Training Department or an equivalent qualification recognized by the Haryana Education Department. The case of the writ petitioners is that they passed their matriculation with the subject of Arts and Crafts/Drawing or they have passed the subject of Arts and Crafts/Drawing in their matriculation as additional subject. The High Court allowed the writ petitions.
In appeal, the court noticed that the experts in the Education Department have held the diploma in Art and Craft by the Kurukshetra University is not equivalent to the two-year diploma in Art and Craft awarded by the Haryana Industrial Training Department. The court noticed the following principles in this regard:
The question regarding equivalence of educational qualifications is a technical question based on proper assessment and evaluation of the relevant academic standards and practical attainments of such qualifications. Where the decision of the Government is based on the recommendation of an expert body, then the Court, uninformed of relevant data and unaided by technical insights necessary for the purpose of determining equivalence, would not lightly disturb the decision of the Government unless it is based on extraneous or irrelevant considerations or actuated mala fides or is irrational and perverse or manifestly wrong. ( Mohammad Shujat Ali v. Union of India )It is not for the court to consider the relevance of qualification prescribed for various posts. (J. Ranga Swamy v. Government of Andhra Pradesh)The prescribed eligibility qualification for admission to a course or for recruitment to or promotion in service are matters to be considered by the appropriate authority. (State of Rajasthan v. Lata Arun)The equivalence is a technical academic matter. It cannot be implied or assumed. Any decision of the academic body of the university relating to equivalence should be by a specific order or resolution, duly published (Guru Nanak Dev University v. Sanjay Kumar Katwal)The State, as an employer, is entitled to prescribe qualifications as a condition of eligibility, after taking into consideration the nature of the job, the aptitude required for efficient discharge of duties, functionality of various qualifications, course content leading up to the acquisition of various qualifications, etc. (Zahoor Ahmad Rather & Ors. v. Sheikh Imtiyaz Ahmad)
Allowing the appeal, the court observed thus:
Judicial review can neither expand the ambit of the prescribed qualifications nor decide the equivalence of the prescribed qualifications with any other given qualification. Equivalence of qualification is a matter for the State, as recruiting authority, to determine. .. Having regard to the above, in our view, the High Court has erred in holding that the diploma/degree in Art and Craft given by the Kurukshetra University is equivalent to two-year Diploma in Art and Craft examination conducted by the Haryana Industrial Training Department or diploma in Art and Craft conducted by Director, Industrial Training and Vocational Education, Haryana.

The Supreme Court has observed that the benefit of probation under Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 is not excluded by the provisions of the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed for offences under Indian Penal Code.
In this case, the accused were convicted under Section 397 IPC and were sentenced to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment of 7 years each. When the case reached the Apex Court, it was submitted that the dispute had been amicably resolved. Opposing the accused prayer seeking benefit under the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, the state contended that the minimum sentence provided by the statute under Section 397 is 7 years and the same cannot be reduced below that period.
The Court observed that Section 4 of the Act could come to the aid of the accused as the offence committed, of which they have been found guilty, is not punishable with death or imprisonment for life. The court also added that since they were under 21 years of age on the date of the offence and not on the date of conviction, Section 6 would not come to their aid. Regarding Section 4 invocation, the bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy said:
"The legal position insofar as invocation of Section 4 is concerned has been analysed in Ishar Das vs. State of Punjab elucidating that nonobstante clause in Section 4 of the Act reflected the legislative intent that provisions of the Act have effect notwithstanding any other law in force at that time. The observation in Ramji Missar (supra) was cited with approval to the effect that in case of any ambiguity, the beneficial provisions of the Act should receive wide interpretation and should not be read in a restricted sense.
Regarding the reliance placed on State of Madhya Pradesh v. Vikram Das to contend that the courts cannot impose less than the minimum sentence prescribed by the statute, the bench observed thus: 
The fact that Section 18 of the Act does not include any other such offences where a mandatory minimum sentence has been prescribed suggests that the Act may be invoked in such other offences. A more nuanced interpretation on this aspect was given in CCE vs. Bahubali. It was opined that the Act may not apply in cases where a specific law enacted after 1958 prescribes a mandatory minimum sentence, and the law contains a non-obstante clause. Thus, the benefits of the Act did not apply in case of mandatory minimum sentences prescribed by special legislation enacted after the Act.It is in this context, it was observed in State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Vikram Das (Supra) that the court cannot award a sentence less than the mandatory sentence prescribed by the statute. We are of the view that the corollary to the aforesaid legal decisions ends with a conclusion that the benefit of probation under the said Act is not excluded by the provisions of the mandatory minimum sentence under Section 397 of IPC, the offence in the present case
The bench therefore, ordered release of the accused on probation of good conduct under Section 4 of the said Act 'on their completion of half the sentence and on their entering into a bond with two sureties each to ensure that they maintain peace and good behaviour for the remaining part of their sentence, failing which they can be called upon to serve that part of the sentence.'
Advocates Isha Aggarwal and Anirudh Sanganeria argued for the petitioner.
CASE: LAKHVIR SINGH VS. STATE OF PUNJABCORAM: Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh RoyCITATION: LL 2021 SC 27
Read Judgment

The Karnataka High Court has held that state government cannot interfere and control the fee structure of private unaided educational institutions. It thus declared as ultra vires Section 48 of the Karnataka Education Act 1983 which prohibits private unaided schools from collecting fee in any manner except as prescribed by the State government
A single judge bench of Justice E S Indiresh referred to TMA Pai Foundation case and agreed that the decision on the fee structure must be left to the private unaided educational institutions, as those educational institutions do not seek or are not dependent upon any funds from the Government. It also agreed that their financial affairs are affected by giving admissions to students through RTE.
The bench thus observed that interference by the respondent-State insofar as fixing of fee by the private unaided educational institutions violates Article 14 of the Constitution.
The bench also declared Sections 2(11-A) and 124-A of the Act to be contrary to Article 14 of the Constitution Section 124-A is regarding the penalty for contravention of Section 48. Section 2(11-A) pertains to the constitution of the District Education Regulatory Authority to monitor these institutions.
The court also declared Sections 5-A (pertaining to Safety and security of students) and 112-A (Penalty for contravention of Section 5-A) of the Act to be contrary to Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. Further it declared that any notifications issued by the state government under the said sections and rules are held unconstitutional and they are not applicable to private unaided educational institutions.
The Court however cautioned the institutions to not cross the 'Lakshman Rekha'. “The cardinal rule would be to act just, fair and reasonable while formulating the fee structure, so that, no child would be deprived of elementary education in this welfare State, to fulfil the dreams of founding fathers of the Constitution of India. Dreams of children shall run in reality of their blood and heart.”
Petitioners Arguments:
The petitioners, private unaided educational institutions, primarily argued that they are different from the aided educational institutions insofar as financial aspects and therefore, the fee structure of these private unaided educational institutions should be distinct and cannot be controlled by the Fee structure imposed by the respondent-State.
Further, relying upon the judgment in the case of TMA Pai, it was urged that these private educational institutions have a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India, particularly in respect of admissions to the Institutions, and therefore, these institutions have an autonomy and independence to have their own fee structure.
Moreover, these institutions are not aided or funded by the State-Government and the fee structure of the StateGovernment is lesser than what has been prescribed by the institutions coming under the purview of RTE Act and therefore, Rule 10 of the Rules 1995, which provides for collection of fees, cannot be made applicable to the unaided private educational institutions and accordingly, sought for invalidating Rule 10 of Rules 1995 and Rule 4 of Rules 1999, as ultra vires the Constitution of India, so also, contrary to the law declared in T.M.A. PAI FOUNDATION case.
State opposed the pleas
The State government sought to justify the Notification dated 18th May, 2018, by which it sought to regulate fees in private unaided institutes. It submitted that the notification was issued taking into account the interest of Children and to control the educational institutions from charging capitation fee and becoming profit motive.”
Findings:
The bench relied heavily on Karnataka Unaided Schools V/S State Of Karnataka, whereby a Division bench of the High Court last year quashed Sections 5, 7(5)(b), 7(1)(e) and 38(1)(a) of the Act and Rule 18(2 & 3), Rule 19(3) of the Rules 1995, and Rule 4 of Rules 1999 as ultra vires the Constitution of India and contrary to the decision of TMA Pai.
The bench said “The same is binding on the petitioners, for in some of these writ petitions those provisions are impugned.”
Further the court said “Section 48 of the Act provides for Fees and Donations and Section 51 of the Act provides for Monies Received from sources other than grant shall be accounted. These two provisions run contrary to each other. Therefore, the right to levy, collect and charge fees, donations and other payments as provided under Section 48 of the Act, is to be held unconstitutional, as there is direct interference of the Government authorities with the administration of the private unaided educational institutions.”
It also said “When enabling provisions itself are unconstitutional and ultra vires, the penal provision flowing therefrom for violation of provisions, cannot be sustained. In that view of the matter, amending provision, i.e. Section 1(2)(iiia) of the Act, extending the Act to the schools affiliated to CBSE/ICSE, is beyond the competence of the Act.”
Noting that though Section 124-A provides for penalty for contravention of Section 48 of the Act. However, there are no relevant rules nor the Act provides for conducting investigation, extending opportunity to the erring private unaided educational institutions, before taking action under Section 48 following Section 124-A of the Act.
The bench held “On this count alone, these two provisions, i.e. Sections 48 and 124-A of the Act, violate principles of natural justice enunciated under Article 14 of the Constitution of India and therefore, the same are held to be invalidated.”
The bench also pointed that the state government, has not produced any document to satisfy the court that the impugned Notification/Amendment/Rules made to the Education Act, was Assented by the President and the said Notification/Amendment/Rules was assented by the Governor.
Following which it said, “I am of the opinion that any such amendment made to the Act without obtaining the Assent of the President in a field occupied by both the levels of the Government (concurrent list), amounts to procedural illegality and therefore, such amendment made to the Act requires to be held as unconstitutional on the question of competency. The impugned Notification/Amendment/Rules were gazetted without the Assent of the President, and same are unconstitutional.”
Rules for Safety of Children should be for all:
While striking down Section 5A the bench observed “No material has been produced by the respondent-Government showing that it has framed frame rules under Sections 5-A and 112-A of the Act, nor implemented the guidelines issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of AVINASH MEHROTRA v. UNION OF INDIA reported in (2009)6 SCC 398 in respect of safety standards in schools and related requirements.
Following which it urged the government to “Frame an independent rule governing the safety standards to be maintained, not only in private schools, but also, in a strict sense implement the same in Government Schools.”
Thus it held “I am of the view that Section 5-A of the Act suffers from infirmity under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. In view of the fact that Section 5-A is contrary to Article 14 of the Constitution of India, hence the corresponding penal provision provided under Section 112-A of the Act, is also unconstitutional and is liable to be set aside.”

The Karnataka High Court has held that under section 7 of the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1960, once a Society is registered with a particular name, registration of a second Society with the same name is impermissible.
 A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna thus declared the registration of Bengaluru Urban District Amateur Kabbadi Association as illegal and quashed it.
 The bench held, "Registration of the 3rd respondent/ Association runs foul of the mandate of Section 7 of the Act, as both the Associations are not too nearly similar but are virtually same. Once a Society is registered with a particular name, registration of a second Society with the same name is impermissible."
 The petitioner Bengaluru Urban Zilla Amateur Kabbadi Association had approached the court questioning the order of District Registrar of Societies, cancelling the registration of the petitioner/Association for violation of Section 27(2) of the Act.
 Findings: 
 The bench on going through the records noted that the petitioner/Association was registered about four months prior to the respondent/Association and that the difference between the names of two associations is the word "Zilla" and "District", both of which mean one and the same in Kannada and English versions. Except for this change, there was no other change in the names of the Associations.
 Thus referring to section 7 of the Act, which pertains to societies not to be registered with undesirable names, the bench said,
"The mandate of the provision is that Society shall not be registered by name which in the opinion of the Registrar is undesirable for the reason that a name which is identical with or too nearly reassembles the name by which the Society first in existence has been previously registered would be deemed to be undesirable."
 It observed that if the names of the petitioner/Association and the 3rd respondent/Association are juxtaposed, what would unmistakably emerge is that the names are identical, they are not too nearly resembling each other but they are the same except usage of version of the language in Kannada and English. Thus, the District Registrar erred in registering the Respondent society after  registration of the petitioner/Association.
 Then the bench referred to section 27 of the Act which directs that any society carrying on any unlawful activity within its premises would become open for an inquiry and its registration may be cancelled, if the Registrar is so satisfied. However, the provision nowhere mandates that a pre-registration act of registration of a Society could also become an offence.
 In the instant case, the bench noted that all the allegations against the petitioner/Association were of pre-registration stage. Thus it held,
 "The Legislature in its wisdom has not made pre-registration acts an offence.Therefore, the very complaint registered, inquiry held and the order of cancellation of registration of the petitioner/Association would all thus be rendered illegal and unsustainable."
 Accordingly, it allowed the petition.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently upheld lower court's decision dismissing the execution petition of decree holder-wife as unsatisfied, due to the fact that she could not bring on record the properties or assets owned by the judgement-debtor/husband.
The Court noted that the husband was not the owner of the properties whose list was furnished to the Executing Court and so the same cannot be attached.
 The bench comprising Justice Alka Sarin further added that even before this Court, the counsel for the decree-holder/wife has not been able to show anything that links the ownership of the properties with her husband.
 The court was dealing with a case where the parties got divorce and court awarded permanent alimony and maintenance of Rs.60 lakhs to the wife. Wife filed an execution petition for its recovery and the execution was sent for attachment of the properties of the husband. In aftermath, third party objections were filed contending that the properties are not owned by the husband. Due to this, the court dismissed the execution petition as unsatisfied.
 After considering the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the court noted that the husband lives in the United Kingdom and from the record available, he has no property in his name in India.
It remarked that the travails of a decree-holder commence after he has obtained a decree in his favour and in the present case wife is still to recover the permanent alimony and maintenance awarded to her in 2014. The Court said it can sympathize with her for the delay but it finds no illegality in the judgement of the Civil Court at Balachaur or the Family Court, Panchkula.
 The court dismissed the revision petition with liberty to approach the Court with a fresh execution petition once the relevant details are available with her.
 Case Title: Megha Rana Versus Kanwar Samir

The Karnataka High Court has set aside the order passed by the Karnataka State Information Commissioner dismissing the second appeal filed by Public Information Officer, on the ground that the petitioner being the PIO cannot maintain the second appeal under Section 19(3) of the Right to Information Act.
A single judge bench of Justice K S Hemalekha partly allowed the petition filed by the PIO attached to the Karnataka Lokayukta and set aside the order dated 04.01.2018 passed by Commissioner. 
The counsel for the petitioner had contended that the second appeal under Section 19(3) of the RTI Act by the Public Information Officer is maintainable even in the event no first appeal is preferred under Section 19(1) of the RTI Act. Reliance was placed on the decision of the coordinate bench of the high court in the case of Sri. G.H. Sharanappa Vs. The Commissioner and Others which said,
“When a specific remedy is available to the aggrieved party under the Act to prefer an appeal under sub-Section (1) and second appeal under sub-Section (3) of Section 19, in view of specific provision, the Commissioner is not justified in issuing the endorsement to the effect that the petitioner has not exhausted the remedy under Sections 6(1) and 19(1) of the RTI Act, defeating the very provisions of the Act.” 
Following which the Court held “In order to maintain parity, this Court is of the considered view that the writ petition needs to be disposed of in terms of the judgment of the Coordinate Bench of this Court in W.P. No.5474/2018, dated 18.11.2022.” 
Accordingly it remitted the matter back to the Information Commissioner to reconsider the appeal filed by the petitioner under Section 19 (3) of the RTI Act on merits, within an outer limit of six months.

The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday acquitted a man of rape charges while noting that it would be incorrect to punish someone for the offence of rape if the promise to marry did not fructify due to the subsequent events, namely, opposition from family elders which is not attributable to the accused.
The Bench of Justice Joymalya Bagchi and Justice Bivas Pattanayak noted that the man/appellant was a young person and the marriage proposal didn't come to fruition due to the opposition from elders and therefore, it wasn't a case of sex on the false promise of marriage amounting to rape.
The matter in brief
Essentially, the Court was dealing with a criminal appeal filed by one Saddam Hussain directed against the 2015 judgment and order of the lower court [Additional District & Sessions Judge, Fast Track First Court, Islampur, Uttar Dinajpur] convicting him under Section 376 IPC and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment for 10 years.
The prosecution case as alleged against the appellant was to the effect that he cohabited with the victim girl, who was a minor, on the false promise of marriage and as a result, the girl became pregnant. However, when she asked him to marry her, he evaded the issue and refused to marry. 
During the trial, the prosecution examined eight witnesses to prove its case. The defence of the appellant was one of innocence and false implication. In conclusion of the trial, the Court convicted and sentenced the appellant, as aforesaid.
Thereafter, moving the High Court with his appeal, he argued that the victim was a consenting party and the Marriage between the couple could not fructify due to the resistance of the parents of the appellant.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court observed that the evidence of record clearly established that the appellant had cohabited with her on the promise of marriage, however, the Court added, the initial cohabitation wasn't forceful as such allegation was significantly absent in the FIR.
Further, taking into account the argument that the appellant had agreed to marry her but the marriage could not fructify due to the resistance of his parents, the Court observed thus
"Hence, it cannot be said that the appellant did not intend to marry her at the time when they cohabited...Mere failure to keep a promise without anything more cannot lead to the irresistible conclusion that the promise had been dishonestly made from the inception."
Against this backdrop, the Court concluded that it cannot be said that the appellant did not have the intention to marry the victim at the time when they cohabited but such marriage was not possible due to obstruction from elders in the family.
Regarding the argument of the prosecution that the girl was a minor at the time of the incident, the Court found that she was above 16 years at the time of occurrence and therefore, the Court held, the victim had crossed the age of consent.
In light of the aforesaid discussion, the Court set aside the conviction and sentence and acquitted the appellant of the charges leveled against him.

 The Supreme Court observed that in appropriate cases, courts can order house arrest under Section 167 of Code of Criminal Procedure.The court said that, to order house arrest, courts can consider criteria like age, health condition and the antecedents of the accused, the nature of the crime, the need for other forms of custody and the ability to enforce the terms of the house arrest....
 The Supreme Court observed that in appropriate cases, courts can order house arrest under Section 167 of Code of Criminal Procedure.
The court said that, to order house arrest, courts can consider criteria like age, health condition and the antecedents of the accused, the nature of the crime, the need for other forms of custody and the ability to enforce the terms of the house arrest. As regards post-conviction cases, the court said that it is open to the legislature to ponder over employing house arrests.
The bench of Justices UU Lalit and KM Joseph was considering the appeal filed by Gautam Navlakha (Bhima Koregaon Case) in which it considered the question whether the period of 34 days spent in house arrest by the appellant is to be counted towards the period of 90 days under Section 167 Cr.P.C.?
While dismissing the appeal, the bench noted that the house arrest in this case was not ordered purporting to be under Section 167 and thus cannot be treated as having being passed under Section 167. However, the court also, in its judgment considered, whether there be an order for custody other than police custody and judicial custody under Section 167 Cr.P.C.? In other words, the question considered was whether house arrest custody within the embrace of Section 167 of Cr.P.C.?
In concluding part of the judgment, it observed thus:
"137. There is one aspect which stands out. Custody under Section 167 has been understood hitherto as police custody and judicial 204 custody, with judicial custody being conflated to jail custody ordinarily. 138. The concept of house arrest as part of custody under Section 167 has not engaged the courts including this Court. However, when the issue has come into focus, and noticing its ingredients we have formed the view that it involves custody which falls under Section 167. 139. We observe that under Section 167 in appropriate cases it will be open to courts to order house arrest. As to its employment, without being exhaustive, we may indicate criteria like age, health condition and the antecedents of the accused, the nature of the crime, the need for other forms of custody and the ability to enforce the terms of the house arrest. We would also indicate under Section 309 also that judicial custody being custody ordered, subject to following the criteria, the 205 courts will be free to employ it in deserving and suitable cases."
The court in the judgment, refers to various statistics to highlight the problems of overcrowding in prisons and the cost to the state in maintaining prisons
39. Among the advantages which have been perceived in promoting the house arrest, have been avoidance of overcrowding of the prisons and also cost saving. However, concerns have also emerged in regard to the issues arising out of the proper supervision of house arrest [ refers to article "House Arrest", a critical analysis of an intermediate level penal sanction by Jeffrey N. Hurwitz]
"50..There is a tremendous amount of overcrowding in jails in India. Secondly, a very large sum (Rs. 6818.1 crore) was the budget on prisons. Both aspects are relevant in the context of the possibilities that house arrest offer", the court noted.
The court, also noted that, in India the concept of house arrest has its roots in laws providing for preventive detention. It observed:
45. Thus 'house arrests' have been resorted to in India, in the context of law relating to 'preventive detention'. What is however relevant is that preventive detention is also a form of forced detention. House arrest is also custody and forced detention.

Questioning AJK Mass Communication Research Centre's action of conducting a “qualitative assessment” after declaration of results of the interview in a PhD programme, the Delhi High Court has said that it “hopes and expects” that Jamia Millia Islamia will conduct admissions strictly as per the procedure laid down under its academic ordinance and regulations.
Denying relief to a candidate aggrieved by denial of admission to Ph.D. programme in AJK Mass Communication Research Centre, Justice Sanjeev Narula observed that the practice of making such deliberations after award of marks for the interview is contrary to scheme of admission process contemplated under “Ordinance No. 9 (IX), Part I of Ordinances and Regulation (Academic).”
“Court is unable to appreciate why after awarding marks and announcement of results, further assessment was undertaken. Interview is the only time during the entire admission process that merit and suitability of both, candidates and their proposal, are evaluated and assessed,” the court said.
The court was hearing a plea moved by Ikra Khan who was denied admission after being provisionally selected for the PhD programme. Her name was deleted in the subsequent final list. She alleged that her selection was final in all respects and the University had denied her admission arbitrarily and in violation of the Ordinance. 
The University issued an initial notification on August 11, 2022 containing a list of 19 provisionally selected candidates, including petitioner’s name. The candidates were required to report to office of the Director of Centre for verification or submission of documents and to collect an offer letter. 
The CRC held a meeting on August 23, 2022 where further deliberations were held and 11 out of 19 candidates were selected. 
On September 12, the petitioner visited the University to complete admission formalities. However, the same day a notification was issued publishing a list of 11 selected candidates who were recommended by the AJK MCR Centre's Research Committee (CRC) and Committee of Studies (CoS). The said notification did not contain petitioner’s name.
Justice Narula noted that as per the Ordinance, comprehensive assessment of candidates of competence is to be done on the basis of the interview, where the candidates discuss their broad research interest or area through a presentation.
The bench observed that the CRC could have continued with internal deliberations after conducting interviews, but not after declaration of results of the interview. 
“If the information presented during the interview was not adequate and only a rudimentary assessment could have been done on the basis of material presented by the candidates, then marks should not have been awarded and certainly, a list should not have been published, even so provisionally. This deliberative process which spanned over a period of time, after award of marks, is plainly irregular,” the court said. 
Observing that the marks were awarded based on candidate’s competence to pursue research as judged in the interview, the court said that once that was done, subsequent deliberations to ponder upon the competence is a “flawed approach” and a breach of the Ordinance.
The court said since Khan progressed to the stage of interview and reached as far as the Initial Notification, she predictably assumed that admission process is complete and her selection is final. Since the language of notification asks her to complete the formalities, it does give the impression of certainty and thus she has a justifiable reason to draw such an assumption, it added.
“Although the University has defended its action by pleading past practice, yet, in the opinion of Court, Initial Notification ought not have been published, as it is misleading for the candidates and to that extent Court finds this action of the University not to be in conformity with the Ordinance. There is no other provision in the Ordinance which envisages such list to be published while the admission process was still ongoing,” the court said. 
However, the court said the "incongruity" cannot be the sole ground to allow the petition, adding that Khan must be able to establish that she was in fact selected or demonstrate manifest irregularity or arbitrariness in the admission process. 
The court observed that provisionally selected candidates as per the initial notification was only tentative and not based on complete assessment of her candidature. 
"It has been explained that since marks for written examination were not known to CRC at the time of interview, no merit list was drawn up and no supervisor was assigned to any student. Nevertheless, the Initial Notification although provisional, was issued by CoE based on marks of the interview and written exam. Actual deliberations, as per the University, were conducted on 23rd August, 2022, wherein competence of Petitioner and other candidates to pursue proposed research was assessed and it was weighed whether a supervisor could be assigned to mentor and guide the candidate in their proposed area of research. On the basis of this criteria, CRC finally selected only 11 of 19 candidates, which did not include Petitioner," added the court.
Justice Narula said the list prepared after deliberations held on August 23, 2022 was endorsed by CoS in meeting held on September 1, 2022, and 11 candidates were selected for provisional admission which was sent to CoE and Registrar of University, and published in the impugned notification.
"Thus, the provisionally selected candidates as per Initial Notification were undoubtedly not endorsed by CoS as per paragraph 2(g) of the Ordinance and to that extent Petitioner’s version of decisiveness is not made out. That apart, the final list as per Impugned Notification is also provisional in nature and subject to fulfilment of Ph.D. admission guidelines," said the court.
The court also noted that apart from finding her proposal to be lacking merit, the CRC also rejected her candidature due to lack of a faculty member possessing requisite specialisation in the research area of scholar. The title of the proposal was 'Meme – As A Tool Of Political Communication in India: History Scope & Its Effectiveness'.
“The Court cannot step into merits of reasons for non-selection, which is a subject matter of experts. The admission to the Programme mandates assignment of a supervisor for each candidate. The supervisors have limited number of slots available under them per UGC Guidelines and the expertise of supervisor and topic of research proposal of candidate have to be in congruence for assignment of supervisor and successful completion of Ph.D,” the court said.
The court also observed that congruence between a supervisor’s expertise and candidate’s proposed area of research are critical towards grant of admission as well and that the supervisor holds the responsibility for guiding the scholar from inception to completion in their doctoral project.
“Given the limited seats with supervisors, CRC did not recommend admission for candidates, whose proposals/ interview performance indicated that the topic was too scattered/ inconclusive to determine the area of specialisation; or if plagiarism/ similarity levels were high; or if the candidate did not demonstrate requisite competence to carry out the doctoral project. University/ CRC is in best position to assess the candidature of Petitioner. In absence of any demonstrable malice, Court is not inclined to interfere with University’s final decision qua competence of candidature of Petitioner,” the court said. 
The court also said that Khan cannot invoke the doctrine of legitimate expectation on the basis of provisional selection, as no offer letter was issued by the varsity.
“For the reasons discussed above, departure from the stipulated admission process is manifest, which the Court disapproves. This finding will perhaps give some consolation to the Petitioner, but not entirely, as the Court finds no compelling ground to grant her any tangible relief. At this stage, annulment of entire admission process, which is complete, would cause extreme hardship to all candidates who have confirmed admissions and are progressing with their Ph.D. programmes,” it observed.
The court said though its finding regarding departure from the stipulated admission process may give some consolation to the petitioner, it does not find any compelling ground to grant her any tangible relief.
"At this stage, annulment of entire admission process, which is complete, would cause extreme hardship to all candidates who have confirmed admissions and are progressing with their Ph.D. programmes. The Court has also considered the relief of granting admission to the Petitioner, without disturbing the admissions already granted, as a seat has been reserved by way of interim order. However, since she has been denied admission both on merits as well as under paragraph 5(a) of the Ordinance, and not because of a malafide action, such a relief also cannot be granted. Moreover, as it turns out, vacancy in Ph.D. programmes refers to not ‘seats’ available at the centre/ department but to number of scholars a Ph.D faculty member can be assigned for supervision," it said.
Advocates Govind Manoharan, Samiksha Godiyal, Nakul Ranjan and Shivalika Rudrabatla appeared for the petitioner. 
Standing counsel Pritish Sabharwal appeared for JMI.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that whenever it is provided that an offence is cognizable by the Session Court, the Magistrate cannot probe the matter and cannot discharge the accused. With this, the Court set aside an order of magistrate dismissing discharge application filed by an accused booked under Section 306 IPC
The bench of Justice Brij Raj Singh further observed that the Magistrate should have committed the case to the Court of Session under section 209 CrPC, but in spite of doing so, he had heard the application of the accused for discharge, which was not in his domain.
The case in brief
Sukhbir Singh/accused was booked under Section 306 IPC [Abetment of suicide] for allegedly abetting the suicide of a female student who was found dead in a mysterious condition in September 2017 in the hostel after she was ragged in the college.
After the local police investigated the case, a CBCID inquiry was carried and a closure report was filed by the investigating agency in February 2020 by which the applicant was exonerated. Thereafter, the Magistrate issued notice to the informant upon closure report in August 2020.
Thereafter, the applicant was granted anticipatory bail by High Court in November 2020 with a direction to the trial court to pass an order upon the contradictory reports filed by two investigating agencies (local police and CBCID) within two months.
In the meantime, the informant filed a protest petition against the closure report, against which a reply was filed by the applicant and since, the applicant was already on anticipatory bail, he preferred a discharge application before the Magistrate, which was later on withdrawn.
The reason for such withdrawal was that the application would not be maintainable before the Magistrate's court but before the Session Court as the offence under Section 306 I.P.C. was exclusively triable by Session Court.
However, the magistrate dismissed the closure report and proceeded on the discharge application on merit, and pass the impugned order by rejecting the application for discharge. In the meantime, a non-bailable warrant was issued against the applicant in January 2021, therefore, both orders were challenged before the Court.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court referred to Section 209 of CrPC which states that an offence triable by Court of Session should be committed by the Magistrate (to the court of sessions) before whom the accused appears or is brought before.
Against this backdrop, the Court noted that in the present case, since the offence is triable by Session Court and therefore, while, hearing the application of discharge, the Court observed thus:
"...the Magistrate committed error by assuming the jurisdiction of Session Court. The Session Court has to apply its mind whether the applicant is liable to be discharged or whether application is liable to be rejected. The Magisterial Court committed an error by deciding the case itself...The Magistrate overlooked the observation made by the High Court and resumed the jurisdiction of the Session Court while taking decision on the application for discharge. It was incumbent upon the Magistrate to commit the case to the Court of Session but in spite of doing so he heard the application for discharge which was not in his domain. The objection taken by the applicant was not considered by the Magistrate and he passed the order ignoring the statutory provision of judgment of Supreme Court without applying its mind."
With this, the Court set aside the order of the magistrate and with the following directions:- 
(i) The Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Room No.1, Bareilly will commit the case within one and half months from today to the Court of Session. 
(ii) The Court of Session will pass appropriate order on the application for discharge of the applicant within two months from the date of committal order in accordance with law after affording an opportunity of hearing to the parties.
It may further be noted that in Balveer Singh And Anr vs State Of Rajasthan And Anr CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 253 OF 2016, the Apex Court had held that the committal of a case exclusively triable by the Court of Session, in a case instituted by the police is mandatory.
"The scheme of the Code simply provides that the Magistrate can determine, whether the facts stated in the report make out an offence triable exclusively, by the Court of Session. Once he reaches the conclusion that the facts alleged in the report, make out an offence triable exclusively by the Court of Session, he must commit the case to the Sessions Court."
The present application was thus allowed.

The Rajasthan High Court observed that there is nothing in law that permits a candidate to apply in the 'Divorcee Female' category in the expectancy that a divorce decree would be granted by the Court.
 A division bench of Justice Vinod Kumar Bharwani and Justice Sandeep Mehta, observed,
"For a person, applying in the said category, the status of being divorced was imperative. There is nothing in law which can permit a candidate to apply in the said category in the expectancy that a decree would be granted".
 The petitioner had filed a writ petition assailing the notice whereby her candidature was rejected as she did not possess the decree of divorce on the last date of submission of the online application form for the post of Stenographer Grade-III (Hindi and English) in the District Courts and the District Legal Services Authorities.
 The court observed that the recruitment notification in question, in no uncertain terms, stipulated that the reservation was being offered to the "Divorcee Female" category.
 Relying on the Apex Court decision of Ashok Kumar Sonkar vs. Union of India [(2007) 3 SCC 956], the court observed the petitioner was not a 'Divorced Female' as on the last date of submission of application forms and was not entitled to apply in the said category and as a consequence, the respondents were absolutely justified in rejecting her candidature in the category of Divorcee Female.
 In Ashok Kumar Sonkar, the Apex Court was considering the aspect of the candidate not holding the requisite academic qualification by the last date of submission of the application forms. It was held that if the Rules and the recruitment notification are silent, the last date for considering the qualification would be the last date of submission of the application forms.
 In the present matter, the petitioner was married to one Shri Vikash on 06.07.2018 and later took a customary divorce in Society Panchayat on 17.09.2018. An application under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act was filed on 12.07.2019  and the decree of divorce was passed on 13.08.2020.
 As the application under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act had already been filed long before submitting the application form in the recruitment process, the petitioner applied in the category of Divorcee Female. 
The final result was declared on 15.12.2021 wherein, a note was appended that the petitioner did not have the decree of divorce on the last date of submission of online application form i.e. 28.02.2020 and thus, she was not being considered in Divorcee Female category. Being aggrieved, the present writ has been preferred.
 Adv. Rakesh Arora, representing the petitioner, argued that respondents were totally unjustified in turning down the petitioner's candidature in the Divorcee Female category as she was already having a customary divorce agreement.
 He further contended that as the application for divorce by mutual consent under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act had also been filed well before issuance of the recruitment notification but could not be decided because of the prevailing COVID pandemic and hence, the petitioner ought to have been given appointment in the Divorcee Female category as per her merit.
The Court dismissed the petition as being devoid of merit.

The Delhi High Court has observed that registration is not necessary where family arrangement is oral and that the same is necessary only if the terms of the arrangement are reduced into writing.
"It is well settled that registration would be necessary only if the terms of the family arrangement are reduced into writing. Here also, a distinction should be made between a document containing the terms and recitals of a family arrangement made under the document and a mere memorandum prepared after the family arrangement had already been made either for the purpose of the record or for information of the court for making necessary mutation. In such a case the memorandum itself does not create or extinguish any rights in immovable properties and therefore does not fall within the mischief of Section 17(2) of the Registration Act and is, therefore, not compulsorily registrable" Justice Najmi Waziri reiterated.
Relance was placed on Korukonda Chalapathi Rao v. Korukonda Annapurna Sampath Kumar.
The Court was dealing with a plea filed by two individuals challenging the order passed by the Additional Rent Controller granting the respondent tenant the Leave to Defend. The development had ensued in the petitioner's application seeking the tenant's eviction under sec. 14(1) (e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958.
Since 1983, the tenant was in occupation of the tenanted premises. The son and daughter-in-law of petitioner no.1 were professionals. Since 2009 the son was a practicing advocate in Delhi, his wife was a Chartered Accountant. They were dependent upon petitioner no. 1 for their office accommodation. 
According to them, there could be no other place more suitable, convenient and a more prestigious, address than the tenanted premises which was present in the heart of New Delhi, i.e. Connaught Place.
There was no dispute qua the existence of landlord or tenant relationship. The petitioners landlords had brought on record documents to show their right and title in the property. 
The sole reason why the leave to defend was granted was that the tenants had made out a triable case apropos the petitioners landlords having alternate accommodation in the vicinity.
In the leave to defend application, the respondent tenant had argued that the leave to defend had rightly been granted because the landlord was seeking additional accommodation whereas, he was already in possession of alternate vacant space in the same building which was earlier occupied by the bank, now stood vacated.
In the eviction petition, the petitioners landlords had elaborately explained the reason why the shop on the ground floor, albeit larger in size, than the tenanted premises, was not suitable. 
The Counsel appearing for the petitioners landlords submitted that the two shops which were said to be available with them were so small that a table and a chair could barely be fitted into it, let alone the same being used as an office for consultation by a lawyer or a Chartered Accountant. 
Furthermore, it was argued the said shop did not have and there was no scope for constructing a toilet nor did it have any conference room or waiting room or a space for office staff, pantry and other amenities, which were necessary for a modern day law office and/or a CA office.
"It is settled law that apropos suitability of tenanted premises for the landlords' bona fide need, the landlord is the best judge. It is the prerogative of the landlord to determine the suitability of the land/space available with him for the need espoused. The tenant cannot dictate to or instruct a landlord as to how and which property of the latter should be used for which purpose," the Court said. 
The Court noted that the need of the landlord was a commercial one and that the property was used for residential purpose and it could not be put to commercial use. Therefore, the Court said that ex-facie the said property could not be considered as being alternate accommodation available with the landlord.
The Court also took note of the comprehensive family arrangement which had been made apropos residential and commercial properties owned by the family and was subsequently crystallised and registered. 
"A family arrangement may be even an oral arrangement, in which case, no registration is necessary. It is only necessary if the terms of family arrangement are reduced into writing," the Court said.
The court was thus of the view that the impugned order had erred in granting leave to defend because there was no triable issue raised by the tenant, which needed determination. 
"The petitioners had fairly disclosed all properties owned by them and the fact that of all those properties none of it was available nor suitable as alternate accommodation," it added. 
While allowing the petition, the Court however added that in terms of sec. 14(7) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 the order shall not be executable for a period of six months.

Punjab and Haryana High Court while dealing with an appeal filed by the widow claiming right over the suit property on the basis of natural succession, held that appellant's husband was not the owner of the suit land on the date of his death, therefore, the question of inheritance of the estate does not arise. It has been held that late Sh. Baldev Singh was not the owner of the suit land on the date of his death. Hence, the question of inheritance of the estate does not arise. The bench comprising Justice Anil Kshetarpal was dealing with the case where the original plaintiff filed the instant appeal, assailing the correctness of the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below. The plaintiff claimed the suit property based on natural succession, claiming that her late husband owned and possessed the same. She filed a suit against 4 of her sons and subsequent purchasers from her 4 sons. The Court considered the written statement by the defendants which claimed that the husband of the appellant in the Civil Court acknowledged the 4 sons to be the owners in possession of the property resulting in a judgment and decree passed by the Civil Court in their favor.

Emphasizing that an employee in a transferable job has no vested right to remain posted at one place, the Delhi High Court has said that Courts should not readily interfere with the transfer order which is made in the public interest and for administrative reasons, unless the transfer order is made in violation of any mandatory statutory rule or on the ground of mala fide.
A division bench comprising of Justice Manmohan and Justice Navin Chawla added that if the Courts continue to interfere with day-to-day transfer orders issued by the Government or its subordinate Authorities, there will be complete chaos in the administration which would not be conducive to the public interest.
The Court was dealing with a plea seeking to set aside the order passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi dismissing the petition filed by the petitioner. 
The plea further prayed for quashing and setting aside of the Office Order dated 09.04.2020 issued transferring the petitioner from New Delhi to Jaipur.
It was the case of the petitioner that in June 1992, he joined as a Section Officer in the Horticulture Wing. While in service, during the year 2016, the hearing impairment of the petitioner became quite severe, following which a duly-constituted Medical Board examined him at Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi. 
The petitioner, vide Disability Certificate dated 14.06.2016, was found suffering from bilateral moderately severe mixed hearing loss with amputation left finger and was assessed as having permanent disability of 65%, that is, 63% for hearing and 2% for locomotor disability of left upper limb.
The petitioner asserts that the respondent no. 2, had in 2018 invited options from Section Officers (Horticulture) for positing at certain stations. The petitioner gave his willingness to be posted to Guwahati and was accordingly transferred to Guwahati. The petitioner joined his new posting only on 18.02.2019.
Vide order dated 16.12.2019, the petitioner along with five other Section Officers was promoted to the post of Assistant Director (Horticulture). Despite representations made seeking transfer to New Delhi, the petitioner was retained in the Eastern Region and vide order dated 17.12.2019, the petitioner was posted to DD (Horticulture), Guwahati HQ: Shillong.
Thereafter, vide order dated 04.03.2020, the petitioner was directed to be posted in the office of DD (Horticulture) at New Delhi with effect from 27.02.2020. However, within thirty-five days of his transfer, vide impugned Office Order, the respondent no. 2 transferred the petitioner from the office of DD (Horticulture) at New Delhi to the office under CE Jaipur in Rajasthan.
"At the outset, it must be emphasised that an employee in a transferable job has no vested right to remain posted at one place. The Courts should not readily interfere with the transfer order which is made in the public interest and for administrative reasons, unless the transfer order is made in violation of any mandatory statutory rule or on the ground of mala fide," the Court said. 
The Court was also of the view that even if a transfer order is passed in violation of executive instructions or orders, the Courts ordinarily should not interfere with the order, instead, the affected party should approach the higher authorities in the concerned department.
"Interference under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is permitted only where the Court finds either the transfer order is mala fide or that the service rules prohibit such transfer or that the Authorities issuing the order were not competent to pass the same. It must be remembered that transfer ordinarily is an incidence of service and must be left to the discretion of the Authorities concerned, which are in the best position to assess the necessities of the administrative requirements of the situation. The Courts must maintain judicial restraint in such matters," the Court said. 
Noting that the petitioner, in his entire career, barring the period less than one year, the petitioner remained posted in New Delhi for almost 28 years, the Court said that the petitioner, therefore, cannot be allowed to claim that his transfer is bad merely because he was not allowed to complete a formal tenure posting of three years at New Delhi after his re-transfer from Shillong to Delhi. 
"Present is one such case where we do not deem it appropriate to interfere with the impugned Officer Order passed by the Authorities, taking into account the earlier posting of the petitioner to New Delhi. In any case, the representation of the petitioner has also been considered by the Competent Authority pursuant to the order dated 11.09.2020 of this Court and the same was rejected," the Court said. 
The Court said that it is a settled law that the High Court, in the exercise of its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, does not sit as a Court of Appeal against the orders passed by the learned CAT.
"The power of judicial review must be exercised restrictively and on limited grounds. In the present case, we find no such infirmity in the impugned order passed by the learned CAT that warrants any interference from this court in exercise of its extra-ordinary discretionary jurisdiction," the Court held. 
Accordingly, the plea was dismissed. 
Case Title: AMARJEET SINGH DAGAR v. UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS

The Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) plea seeking a direction to the State Government to construct the 'Ram Ban Gaman Marg' as per the historical evidence and to connect all such places where Lord Rama took rest at night during his forest Travel (Ban Gaman/वन-गमन). The Bench of Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice J. J. Munir observed that the issue raised by the Petitioner, a political person, cannot be decided in the writ petition. Therefore, the Court dismissed the plea. About Ram Ban Gaman Marg
It is widely believed that Lord Rama, in his 14-year journey from Ayodhya to Sri Lanka, visited 248 prominent places where he either took rest or had some connection with them. Today these places are remembered as the forest journey of Rama (Ram Ban Gaman Path). In the State of Uttar Pradesh, the journey of Lord Rama started from Ram Janmabhoomi Ayodhya and went through Pratapgarh, Prayagraj, Kaushambi to Chitrakoot. This path is called Ram Vanagaman Path (राम वनगमन मार्ग). Its length is about 177 kilometers. The Uttar Pradesh Government has already taken a decision to develop Ram Vanagaman Marg with a cost of over Rs. 4000 crores. In connection with this decision, the instant PIL plea had been moved by Petitioner (Rajneesh Kumar Pandey). The PIL plea prayed for the following direction to the Union and the UP Governments:
- To construct the Ram Ban Gaman Marg as per the history and evidence of Ram Ban Gaman Marg. - To modify the route which is published in the newspaper as per the evidence of record; 
- If the 4 lane construction is not possible everywhere of Ram Ban Gaman Marg then the Authority concern constructs proper connectivity marg of Ram Ban Gaman Marg from all places of Ram Ban Gaman Marg. - To connect all places where Lord Ram took rest at night during the Travel of Forest (Ban Gaman). - To take proper action and not disobey the Route of the Lord Ram Ban Gaman and connect all the places where Lord Ram traveled during hi Ban Gaman. Stressing that the writ petition had been filed for some ulterior motive, the Court noted that the State must have conducted thorough research before making the decision to execute the project in question, and therefore, no direction can be issued for modification of the route of "Ram Van Gaman Marg".

The Bombay High Court has directed a son who "deprived his mother from leading a normal life" to vacate the house "expeditiously", noting that the mother had suffered immensely since over five years.
 Justice Girish Kulkarni observed that it was "astonishing" how the 48-year-old son had invented a novel way of entering the septuagenarian mother's house. He signed a rent agreement with her, with no intention of honouring the agreement as he didn't pay a single rupee to her until she did not approach the authorities against him.
 "In the facts of the present case, the rent agreement is required to be clearly looked at only as an attempt and a struggle on the mother's part to receive benefits from the tenement, so as to avail such small money from the petitioner for her survival/livelihood. Even to make such payment to the mother, the petitioner defaulted, for no justifiable reason. The petitioner in fact deprived the mother of her right to "live a normal life" apart from the fact that he has failed to maintain and support her livelihood," the court observed. 
 Facts of the Case 
 The court was hearing a writ petition filed by Suryakant Pawar against an order passed by the Tribunal under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007. The Tribunal, by an order passed in February 2018, directed Pawar to vacate his mother Kusum Pawar's house in Central Mumbai's Prabhadevi area. The court noted that Suryakant appeared to have entered the tenement "on a specious ground that his children are taking education in a nearby school."
 The court also noted that the petitioner thought of a novel method to dis-house the mother of the tenement by taking advantage of her old age, her lack of education and that she being not literate and benighted.
 The Tribunal had passed the order on Kusum's application against her eldest child, Suryakant under Section 4,5 and 23 of the Act. According to Kusum, she was recognised as the absolute owner of the house by the Mumbai Municipal Corporation after her husband Kisan passed away. The land belonged to the Corporation and the area went into redevelopment. Even the developer of the plot recognised Kusum as the sole owner of the house.
 Suryakant argued that after his father's demise, he was a co-sharer in the property and therefore, he had the right to reside in the house. His lawyer also argued that there should not be any problem in letting Suryakant occupy the premises when he was ready to maintain the mother and she was residing in their native village in Maharashtra.
 The court noted that the rent agreement signed between Kusum and Suryakant in July 2016 was for just 11 months and in fact, the agreement itself said that Kusum was the absolute owner of the premises.
 "This appears to be another clear case where the petitioner has no other intention but to enjoy the tenement exclusively, ousting the roof over his mother's head, taking advantage of her incapacity at such an old age. There appears to be no justification whatsoever, for the petitioner to take possession of the mother's premises even if the petitioner claimed that he is the co-sharer on the ground that the tenement had devolved on the mother from his father and she had limited rights as a co-sharer. The petitioner could not have abused the law by ousting the mother claiming an exclusive entitlement to remain in possession of the premises," Justice Kulkarni observed. The court also said that the petitioner cannot set up a defence which was contrary to the agreement to which he is himself a party.
 The court also accepted Kusum's lawyers arguments on the issue whether a Tribunal can pass such an order or not. Various judgments on this point, including one passed by Justice Kularni himself from last year, were cited.
 The court observed that several judgements interpreting provisions of Senior Citizens Act had brought about new dimensions to make the Act's provisions more meaningful in catering to the interest of the senior citizens, in fulfilling the legislative intent and object behind the said legislation.
 The court then noted a few such judgments – S. Vanitha Vs. Dy. Commissioner, Bengaluru Urban District and Others (Supreme Court); Shweta Shetty Vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors. (Bombay HC); Dattatrey Shivaji Mane Vs. Lilabai Shivaji Mane & Ors (Bombay HC) and Ashish Vinod Dalal & Ors. Vs. Vinod Ramanlal Dalal & Ors. (Bombay HC).

The period of limitation for filing an application under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act would be governed by Article 137 of the First Schedule of the Limitation Act, and will begin to run from the date when there is failure to appoint the arbitrator, the Supreme Court held.In rare and exceptional cases, where the claims are ex facie time barred, and it is manifest that...
The period of limitation for filing an application under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act would be governed by Article 137 of the First Schedule of the Limitation Act, and will begin to run from the date when there is failure to appoint the arbitrator, the Supreme Court held.
In rare and exceptional cases, where the claims are ex facie time barred, and it is manifest that there is no subsisting dispute, the Court may refuse to make the reference, the bench comprising Justices Indu Malhotra and Ajay Rastogi held. The court also suggested amendment of Section 11 of the Act to provide a period of limitation for filing an application under this provision, which is in consonance with the object of expeditious disposal of arbitration proceedings.
In this case, the bench considered two issues: (i) the period of limitation for filing an application under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 ("the 1996 Act"); and (ii) whether the Court may refuse to make the reference under Section 11 where the claims are ex facie time-barred? The bench was considering the appeal filed by BSNL against the Kerala High Court judgment which allowed the application filed by Nortel under Section 11 of the Act before the Kerala High Court for appointment of an arbitrator.
Regarding the first issue, the bench noted that, since there is no provision in the Arbitration Act specifying the period of limitation for filing an application under Section 11, one would have to take recourse to the Limitation Act, as per Section 43 of the Arbitration Act, which provides that the Limitation Act shall apply to arbitrations, as it applies to proceedings in Court. Referring to various judgments on this issue, the bench observed:
"Given the vacuum in the law to provide a period of limitation under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation 1996, the Courts have taken recourse to the position that the limitation period would be governed by Article 137, which provides a period of 3 years from the date when the right to apply accrues."
Unduly long period for filing an application u/S. 11, since it would defeat the very object of the Act,
The court, further observed that this three year period is an unduly long period for filing an application u/S. 11, since it would defeat the very object of the Act, which provides for expeditious resolution of commercial disputes within a time bound period.
"The 1996 Act has been amended twice over in 2015 and 2019, to provide for further time limits to ensure that the arbitration proceedings are conducted and concluded expeditiously. Section 29A mandates that the arbitral tribunal will conclude the proceedings within a period of 18 months. In view of the legislative intent, the period of 3 years for filing an application under Section 11 would run contrary to the scheme of the Act. It would be necessary for Parliament to effect an amendment to Section 11, prescribing a specific period of limitation within which a party may move the court for making an application for appointment of the arbitration under Section 11 of the 1996 Act.", the bench said.
Taking note of the facts of the case, the court observed that application under Section 11 was filed before the High Court on 24.07.2020 i.e. within the period of 3 years of rejection of the request for appointment of the arbitrator.
Where there is not even a vestige of doubt that the claim is ex facie time-barred, or that the dispute is non-arbitrable, that the court may decline to make the reference
However, the court observed that the notice invoking arbitration was issued 5 ½ years after rejection of the claims on 04.08.2014 and therefore it is ex facie time barred, and the disputes between the parties cannot be referred to arbitration in the facts of this case. Answering the second issue, the bench observed thus:
"While exercising jurisdiction under Section 11 as the judicial forum, the court may exercise the prima facie test to screen and knockdown ex facie meritless, frivolous, and dishonest litigation. Limited jurisdiction of the Courts would ensure expeditious and efficient disposal at the referral stage. At the referral stage, the Court can interfere "only" when it is "manifest" that the claims are ex facie time barred and dead, or there is no subsisting dispute.....It is only in the very limited category of cases, where there is not even a vestige of doubt that the claim is ex facie time-barred, or that the dispute is non-arbitrable, that the court may decline to make the reference. However, if there is even the slightest doubt, the rule is to refer the disputes to arbitration, otherwise it would encroach upon what is essentially a matter to be determined by the tribunal." 

The Supreme Court observed that the method of determination of compensation applying two multipliers is erroneous.The suitable multiplier is to be applied keeping in view the age of the deceased, the bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian said.In this case, in an appeal filed against the order of Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal, the Madras High Court affirmed the...
The Supreme Court observed that the method of determination of compensation applying two multipliers is erroneous.
The suitable multiplier is to be applied keeping in view the age of the deceased, the bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian said.
In this case, in an appeal filed against the order of Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal, the Madras High Court affirmed the findings recorded by the Tribunal in respect of multiplier of 3 upto the date of superannuation and thereafter multiplier of 8 keeping in view the dependency of life for 10 years. 
Challenging this judgment, the appellant- claimants contended before the Apex court bench that the multiplier methodology adopted by the Tribunal and affirmed by the High Court was erroneous and not sustainable. It was contended that the multiplier is applied keeping in view the age of deceased and income at the time of death and not by considering the remaining years of service. On the other hand, the respondents relied on some High Court judgments to justify the applicability of split multiplier.
The bench noted that, in National Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi (2017) 16 SCC 680 , it has been held that the age of the deceased should be the basis for applying the multiplier. The judgments referred to justify split multiplier is prior to the enunciation of law in Pranay Sethi. The court, therefore, observed:
"Thus, we find that the method of determination of compensation applying two multipliers is clearly erroneous and run counter to the judgment of this Court in Pranay Sethi, affirming the judgment in Sarla Verma. Since the deceased was 54 years of age on the date of incident, therefore, the suitable multiplier would be as per the judgment of this Court in Sarla Verma approved by this Court in Pranay Sethi"
Allowing the appeal, the bench held that the claimants are entitled to compensation of Rs. 24,33,064/- with interest @ 9% from the date of filing of the claim application till realisation.

Caselaw:
Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 - Motor Accident Compensation - Method of determination of compensation applying two multipliers is clearly erroneous - The age of the deceased should be the basis for applying the multiplier [referred to National Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi & Ors (2017) 16 SCC 680]
Factual Summary - The Madras High Court affirmed the findings recorded by the Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal, in respect of multiplier of 3 upto the date of superannuation and thereafter multiplier of 8 keeping in view the dependency of life for 10 years. Allowing appeal, the Supreme Court set aside the High Court.

"Sensitivity and compassion balanced with rules, regulations and law needs to be maintained by any Court as one is dealing with humans and not mere files and orders," the Delhi High Court has observed while granting parole of 45 days to a murder convict. 
Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma granted relief to Kundan Singh, who is serving life sentence in the Tihar Jail. Singh, who is a native of Uttarakhand, was convicted in January 2014 for murdering his friend Vipin Kumar, whose head, hands and legs below the knee had been chopped off and thrown away in a jungle near Lado Sarai bus stand in August 2007. The high court in 2015 upheld Singh's conviction. The Supreme Court also dismissed his SLP in July 2019.
"The petitioner has been in custody for more than 14 years. It is also not disputed that it will be 06 months since he was granted emergency parole on 02.11.2022. While considering grant of parole, the court also has to remain conscious of the fact that the petitioner has been awarded life imprisonment and circumstances have arisen in the last 14 years which he needs to attend to family exigencies," said the court.
The convict's application seeking parole for two months was rejected on July 27 by Delhi government's home department after the Superintendent, Central Jail did not recommend grant of parole to him in view of his conduct in the jail during the last one year. Singh had applied for parole to "complete the partition of undivided ancestral property" of his joint Hindu family and to arrange funds for his "family needs".
Contending that the grounds on which the parole was denied to him are erroneous, the counsel representing the convict submitted the reasons mentioned for rejecting his application was that he had not completed two years since his last punishment in jail was awarded on January 5, 2022.
The counsel argued that the matter is pending inquiry before the concerned District and Sessions Judge and that Singh has already been punished for the same by the jail authorities. The court was also told that he has been granted parole seven times in the past, including an emergency parole between April 23 and May 02 on account of his mother's barsi.
On the other hand, the APP for the State submitted that the parole was declined by the concerned authority since the convict's jail conduct was unsatisfactory and multiple punishments were awarded to him for breach of the Rules. 
Referring to the nominal role, the State submitted that the convict was awarded punishments for prison offences on 17 occasions between 2013 and January 2022.
The court in the order said that the convict has not been involved in any offence involving violence in the last two years, and the last two jail punishments are a matter of inquiry before the District & Sessions Judge.
"...therefore, it is yet not clear whether they will be found to be liable for major punishment or not. It is also clear from the nominal roll that the petitioner was awarded punishment as was deemed appropriate by the jail authorities for the breach of Prison Rules which are clearly mentioned in the nominal roll. It is not disputed that the petitioner was granted parole on 07 occasions including one emergency parole and he had not misused the liberty of parole granted to him."
The court said it was inclined to grant him conditional parole for a period of 45 days, considering that he has spent "14 long years in jail" and has been granted parole seven times in the past. It also noted that he lost his mother while he was in judicial custody and now, after her death, "such exigences" have arisen which he needs to attend to".
Granting him parole, the court directed the convict to furnish a personal bond of Rs 25,000 before the Jail Superintendent. The court also referred to a pending FIR and asked the petitioner to not indulge in any act that would prejudice the proceedings in that matter. 
Ordering him to not leave Nainital during the period of parole, the court said, "The petitioner will report on every Wednesday to the SHO PS : Kathgodam, District Nainital, Uttarakhand between 11 am and 11:30 am for marking his appearance. However the petitioner will not be kept waiting for longer than one hour at the police station during such visits'' 
Title: KUNDAN SINGH v. THE STATE (GOVT. OF NCT) DELHI

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently observed that if doctors face the threat of being beaten up or being harassed by the relatives of patients every single day, then it would be difficult for them to function.The Bench of Justice Vikas Bahl observed thus while dismissing a 482 CrPC plea for quashing of an FIR registered against Naresh Kumar and others (applicants before the Court)...
The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently observed that if doctors face the threat of being beaten up or being harassed by the relatives of patients every single day, then it would be difficult for them to function.
The Bench of Justice Vikas Bahl observed thus while dismissing a 482 CrPC plea for quashing of an FIR registered against Naresh Kumar and others (applicants before the Court) for allegedly creating turmoil and disturbance in the Hospital, beating up doctors and threatening to murder the Doctor.
The case in brief
An FIR in this matter was registered u/s 147 (Punishment for rioting), 149 (Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
Allegedly, after the death of one patient Ompati, her relatives started making phone calls and they called other persons, who after reaching the Hospital, started creating turmoil and disturbance in the Hospital and they threatened to murder the Doctor.
Thereafter, when the respectable Doctors of I.M.A. also reached on the spot, they (the applicants) threatened them to go outside and on not doing the same, they beat up the Doctors of I.M.A. and even snatched important papers from their hands and also threatened them to go.
Court's observations
After perusing the FIR and taking into account other relevant circumstances and pieces of evidence, the Court was prima facie of the view that force and violence had been used by the relatives of the deceased Ompati and they were found to be in an unlawful assembly, thus, an offence under Section 149 IPC would stand prima facie made out.
"In fact, even from the document annexed by the petitioners i.e. cancellation report, it comes to surface that as per the CCTV camera recordings, some fist blows had been given to Dr. Pankaj Parashar and the papers were snatched from Dr. Raj Kumar Sharma. At any rate, all the said facts would come about after the investigation is complete and the challan is presented," the Court noted as it dismissed the 482 plea filed by the petitioners.
However, before parting, the Court observed that although, there would be a feeling of sympathy towards persons whose family member has passed away but the said persons including the petitioners must respect the Doctors who always try their best to save the lives of patients and, thus, such persons should not breach the law in case some untoward incident happens.
"It will be difficult for the Doctors to function in our country if they always face the threat of being beaten up or being harassed by the relatives of patients as every single day, they have to deal with situations in which life and death of a patient is involved," the Court concluded.

"The specific purpose may be infertility treatment or some similar reason, but it should not be construed to be a fundamental right for having conjugal relationship as a course", the larger bench clarified in the reference made by the Division benchIn a pertinent judgment, Madras High Court has answered i) whether the denial of conjugal rights to a convicted prisoner would be violative of Article 21 and, ii) whether the state can be directed to consider the request made by convict for emergency leave or ordinary leave for the said purpose. Since the right of their spouses to have conjugal rights are also indirectly curtailed...
In a pertinent judgment, Madras High Court has answered i) whether the denial of conjugal rights to a convicted prisoner would be violative of Article 21 and, ii) whether the state can be directed to consider the request made by convict for emergency leave or ordinary leave for the said purpose. 
Since the right of their spouses to have conjugal rights are also indirectly curtailed by such denial, Madras High Court has examined the scope of treating conjugal rights of a convict/ prisoner as a fundamental right, and in case there is such a right, whether it would be unconditional or subject to other restrictions. The court answered the above questions while deciding upon the propriety of directing the state to grant emergency leave or ordinary leave to a convict for the purpose of having a conjugal relationship with the spouse.
In a reference made by the Division Bench of High Court over the dilemma that there is no specific provision in Tamil Nadu Suspension of Sentence Rules, 1982, for availing leave to have conjugal relationship with the spouse, a three-judge bench of Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari, Justice PD Audikesavalu and Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana answered in the affirmative that prisoners/ convicts can claim such a right if there is a ground of  'extraordinary reason' and infertility treatment falls within the definition of 'extraordinary reasons' as envisaged in the Act. The bench opined that the prayer of the petitioner to undergo infertility treatment when the convict and the spouse do not have a child in the wedlock forms 'extraordinary reason' under Rule  20 (vii) of 1982 Rules. However, the court made a clarification that if the couple had a child in the wedlock, then seeking leave for infertility treatment would not have been considered as an 'extraordinary reason'. The convict/ prisoner cannot seek leave over and over for the same ground in the category of 'extraordinary reason', the court added.
"It is true that the 1982 Rules do not provide leave for having conjugal relationship with spouse. It is for the reason that if a provision for leave to have conjugal relationship is provided, the prisoner may ask for the leave invariably on that ground and, that too, time and again. It cannot, however, mean that under all circumstances except those specified in Rule 20(i) to (vi) and Rule 20(viii) of the 1982 Rules leave can be denied, rather Rule 20(vii) of the 1982 Rules provides for grant of leave for any other extraordinary reasons, which can be of the nature referred in this case, i.e., for undergoing infertility treatment..."
About whether it can be held that the denial of conjugal rights offends Article 21 and whether the convict/ prisoner can seek to avail such a right continuously and without no restraint, the larger bench noted as below:
"The denial of conjugal relationship of the convict for specific purpose may amount to denial of the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The specific purpose may be infertility treatment or some similar reason, but it should not be construed to be a fundamental right for having conjugal relationship as a course. This would make a difference between the law abider and violator in regard to rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India."
The three-judge bench was of the firm opinion that a leave for a 'specific purpose' like infertility treatment is different from the use of the term 'conjugal relationship' in common parlance and falls well within the realm of 'extraordinary reason'' provided for in the Rules. Therefore, the court concluded that the 1982 Rules itself protect the rights of the prisoner guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India to the extent it is required, without any specific provision for grant of leave to convicts for maintaining their conjugal relationship.
On the basis of the above finding on the first question, the court went on to answer the second question. The court observed that the state can be directed to grant ordinary/ emergency leave for 'extraordinary reasons' like infertility treatment. Leave cannot be claimed as a right by the prisoner/ convict for having a conjugal relationship with his/ her/ their spouse without an 'exceptional reason'.
The husband detenue who is a life convict and the petitioner wife did not have a child out of wedlock. Though the former was granted ordinary leave of two weeks by the Division Bench for availing infertility treatment, another writ petition was filed by the wife for a grant of six weeks leave for having a conjugal relationship through infertility treatment.
Analysing the judgments of Punjab & Haryana High Court in Jasvir Singh v.  State of Punjab (2015), apex court in Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration, (1978) 4 SCC 494 & Bihar High Courtin Rajeeta Patel v. State of Bihar and others (2020), the court formed an opinion that Rule 20(vii) of the 1982 Rules can be invoked for the prisoner to avail ordinary/ emergency leave for having a conjugal relationship only if there are 'extraordinary reasons' for such request made.
"If we hold that deprivation of conjugal right to a convict offends Article 21 of the Constitution of India, it would mean to give right to a convict for conjugal right, which in common parlance is for maintaining the marital relationship of husband and wife in continuity with companionship. The same cannot be permitted for a convict, as a difference has to be made between the law abider and violator. If the case in hand is also taken note of, the petitioner's first petition was allowed with grant of leave for two weeks for undergoing infertility treatment and immediately after availing it, the second petition was filed in continuity. The facts aforesaid cannot be ignored by the court because after the judgment by the court holding conjugal right to be a fundamental right, the convict would come out with an application to secure his fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India without any restraint....", the court elaborated in the concluding part of the judgment about not holding the conjugal relationship of the convicts as a fundamental right they possess under Article 21 as a matter of course, though it can be availed as a fundamental right for 'specific purpose'.
While answering the questions posed by the Division Bench, the three-judge bench also distinguished the judgment of the Madras High Court full bench in The State v. Yesu, (2011). In the said case, the question was pertaining to grant of parole via an administrative instruction under Article 162. The full bench held that neither the government nor any other stathority has power to grant parole in the absence of the rules or a statute.
Analysing the Yesu judgment, the court opined that the findings in the said case does not apply squarely to the power of authorities to grant leave to the convict under the 1982 Rules by suspension of sentence for the leave period.
After answering both the questions in the above manner, the registry was directed by the bench to place the matter before the roster bench for disposal.
Case Title: Meharaj v. The State Rep By Its Secretary & Ors.
Case No: H.C.P. (MD) No.365 of 2018

The Supreme Court observed that 'minimum wages notification' can be considered to determine the notional income of deceased in motor accident claim cases.
As per the claimants, the Deceased was a fish vendor­ cum­ driver and was earning at least Rs. 25,000/­ per month. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal found that the Deceased was a driver and fixed his monthly income at Rs.14,000/­. Additionally, assuming that the Deceased received at least Rs.3,500/­ as rent, the Tribunal calculated his final notional income as Rs.17,500/­-. In appeal, the High Court observed that the maximum monthly income that could have been reckoned is Rs. 10,000/-. In view of this, the High Court substantially reduced the compensation granted by the Tribunal from Rs. 32,39,000/­ to Rs. 19,70,000/-.
Senior Advocate Thomas P. Joseph, who appeared for the appellants- claimants, brought to the notice of the court the Schedule B of the Kerala Motor Transport Workers' Payment of Fair Wages Act, 1971 as per which a 'driver' is classified as a 'Skilled worker' under Category III Skilled­ B. He also referred to the notification G.O. (Ms.) No. 123/2015/LBR dated 04.09.2015 issued by the Government of Kerala wherein, the pay scale for the year 2015 for each category of workers in Schedule B of the Act has been stipulated. It was contended that the Deceased being a registered transport motor driver, was entitled to be considered as a 'driver' as defined under the Kerala Fair Wages Act and his income was to be fixed in terms of the Notification.
Agreeing with this submission, the bench of Justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose noted that there exists sufficient evidence to show that the Deceased was a fish vendor ­cum ­driver with a valid license. 
The court noted that in Chandra Alias Chanda Chandraram v. Mukesh Kumar Yadav (2022) 1 SCC 198, it was held that in the absence of a salary certificate, the minimum wages notification along with some amount of guesswork that is not completely detached from reality shall act as a yardstick to determine the income of the deceased. The court said:
"Schedule B­ Category III of the Kerala Fair Wages Act classifies a driver as a "Skilled worker". Reading this in conjunction with the Notification that came into effect from 01.01.2015 which amended Schedule A of the Kerala Fair Wages Act, prescribing a minimum pay scale of the workers listed in Schedule B, it is apparent that a 'driver' in Kerala earned a minimum of Rs. 15,600/­ in 2015. It appears to us that the aforesaid Act and the notification issued thereunder were not brought to the notice of the Tribunal or the High Court. As a result thereto, the High Court could not be cognizant of the statutory mandate prescribing minimum wages for a skilled worker like 'driver', and thus, erred in fixing the income of the Deceased at Rs.10,000/­. We are therefore inclined to fix the income of the Deceased notionally at Rs. 15,600/­ per month."
Another issue raised by the Insurance Company was regarding the determination of compensation under non­ conventional heads. In this regard, the bench said:
'We are however, not inclined to entertain this plea for the simple reason that the Insurance Company has not chosen to file any appeal against the judgment of the High Court. Having acquiesced, the Insurance Company cannot turn around and question a paltry amount of compensation awarded to the Appellants under the 'nonconventional heads'. However, question of law, in this regard, is kept open."

Headnotes
Motor Accident Compensation Claims - Fixing of notional income - In the absence of a salary certificate, the minimum wages notification along with some amount of guesswork that is not completely detached from reality shall act as a yardstick to determine the income of the deceased -Referred to Chandra Alias Chanda Chandraram and Anr. v. Mukesh Kumar Yadav and Ors (2022) 1 SCC 198 - High Court fixed the notional income of the Deceased driver as 10,000/- - As per notification issued under Kerala Fair Wages Act , a 'driver' in Kerala earned a minimum of Rs. 15,600/-­ in 2015 - Thus Supreme Court fixed income of the Deceased notionally at Rs. 15,600/­- per month. (Para 19-22)
Motor Accident Compensation Claims - Objective formula for calculating just compensation - Three factors that need to be established are: (a) age of the deceased; (b) income of the deceased; and (c) the number of dependents - The issues that are to be determined by the Tribunal to arrive at the loss of dependency are: (i) additions/deductions to be made for arriving at the income; (ii) the deduction to be made towards the personal living expenses of the deceased; and (iii) the multiplier to be applied with reference to the age of the deceased. (Para 17-18)
Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 ; Section 168 - Motor Accident Compensation Claims - While determining compensation under the Act, section 168 of the Act makes it imperative to grant compensation that appears to be just. The Act being a social welfare legislation operates through economic conception in the form of compensation, which renders way to corrective justice. Compensation acts as a fulcrum to bring equality between the wrongdoer and the victim, whenever the equality gets disturbed by the wrongdoer's harm to the victim. It also endeavors to make good the human suffering to the extent possible and to also save families which have lost their breadwinners from being pushed to vagrancy. Adequate compensation is considered to be fair and equitable compensation. Courts shoulder the responsibility of deciding adequate compensation on a case­to­case basis. However, it is imperative for the courts to grant such compensation which has nexus to the actual loss. (Para 16)

Citing technical reasons, the Kerala High Court on Friday quashed the trial court proceedings against Transport Minister of Kerala, Antony Raju in connection with the evidence tampering case against the Minister pending before Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Nedumangad, in Thiruvananthapuram. 
However, the single bench of Justice Ziyad Rahman clarified that this would not preclude the competent authority or the court concerned from taking up the matter and pursuing the prosecution in compliance with the procedure contemplated under Section 195(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure:
“Though, this court interfered in the proceedings for technical reasons, it cannot be ignored that the allegations raised are serious in nature. The materials placed before this Court reveal allegations which are of such nature and gravity that interfere with the judicial functions and thereby polluting the mechanism of administration of justice. Such acts are required to be dealt with strictly with all vigour, and this court expects a positive and effective follow-up action on this from the authorities concerned to ensure that a fair trial in accordance with the law takes place and the culprits are punished adequately.” the court said in its order. 
Taking note of the fact that the offences were allegedly committed in 1990, and further delay would defeat the purpose of the proceedings, the court also directed the registry to take appropriate action in this regard under the relevant provisions of the CrPC.
Senior Advocate P Vijaya Bhanu, appeared for Antony Raju, the 2nd accused, assisted by Advocates Deepu Thankan, Ummul Fida, Lakshmi Sreedhar, R.Rajanandini Menon, Shahnas K.P and Nikita J. Mendez. Advocate S Rajeev appeared for the the 1st accused in the crime. Advocate B.G.Harindranath appeared for the defacto complainant and Public Prosecutor Vipin Narayan appeared for the state.
The court had previously stayed all further proceedings against Raju in the evidence tampering case on the prima facie finding that the procedure stipulated under Sections 195 and 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure had not been complied with in respect of an offence under Section 193 (Punishment for False Evidence) of the Indian Penal Code. The court had observed that under Section 195(1) CrPC any proceedings related to Section 193 IPC and the conspiracy to conduct the same could only be conducted on the basis of a complaint of the concerned court or the officer authorized by court or a subordinate court. In Raju's case, the court found that this mandatory procedure had not been complied with. 
The prosecution case is that Raju while practicing as an advocate conspired in tampering evidence in a case involving an Australian citizen, Andrew Salvatore who was booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Salvatore was found in possession of charas which he had concealed in the pocket of his underwear. In the trial against the Australian National, the undergarment was treated as a crucial piece of evidence. Even though Salvatore was found guilty and sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment by the lower court, he was later acquitted by the High Court after the underwear presented as evidence in the trial court was found to be smaller and could not have been worn by the accused at the time of his arrest. 
The 1st accused in the case was the court clerk who secured the personal belongings of the accused and the 2nd accused was Raju, who was practicing as a lawyer in Thiruvananthapuram at the time. It is alleged that the 1st and 2nd accused conspired together to secure the release of Salvatore from the High Court by tampering with the crucial piece of evidence. 
Even though Salvatore was acquitted by the High Court, the court indicated the possibility of evidence tampering based on which the Vigilance Officer of the court conducted an investigation and submitted his report. An office memorandum was issued to request the Thiruvananthapuram District Court to direct the Sheristadar to give a first information report to the police in this regard. Subsequently, a crime was registered by the police and a final report was submitted. Raju's plea to quash the proceedings against him was allowed on the technical ground that the cognizance taken on the police report was not legally tenable as it was in violation of the procedure mandated in Section 195(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The Supreme Court observed that a tenant ­in ­sufferance is not entitled to any protection of the Rent Act against SARFAESI proceedings.
A tenant whose term has expired but has not vacated is called a "tenant at sufferance.‟.
In the absence of a registered instrument, if the tenant only relies upon an unregistered instrument or an oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession, the tenant is not entitled to possession of the secured asset for more than the period prescribed under the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, the bench of Justices S. Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari observed.
In this case, the appellant contended that he is a protected tenant under the provisions of the Maharashtra Rent Control Act 1999, and was residing in the premises of the borrower on the basis of an oral tenancy from 12.06.2012. The proceedings under Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002, were initiated against the borrowers. The intervention application of the appellant was dismissed by the Magistrate holding that there was no registered tenancy placed on record by him
In appeal, the court noted that in Harshad Govardhan Sondagar v. International Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd. , it was held that if the tenancy claim is for any term exceeding one year, the tenancy can be made only by a registered instrument. Referring to Bajarang Shyamsunder Agarwal v. Central Bank of India, the bench observed: 
"12. A Three ­Judge Bench of this Court in Bajarang Shyamsunder Agarwal v. Central Bank of India & Anr, after considering almost all decisions of this Court, in relation to the right of a tenant in possession of the secured asset, has held that if a valid tenancy under law is in existence even prior to the creation of the mortgage, such tenant's possession cannot be disturbed by the secured creditor by taking possession of the property. If a tenancy under law comes into existence after the creation of a mortgage but prior to issuance of a notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act, it has to satisfy the conditions of Section 65­A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. If a tenant claims that he is entitled to possession of a Secured Asset for a term of more than a year, it has to be supported by the execution of a registered instrument. In the said decision of this Court, it was clarified that in the absence of a registered instrument, if the tenant only relies upon an unregistered instrument or an oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession, the tenant is not entitled to possession of the secured asset for more than the period prescribed under the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act."
The court noted that it was also held that the Rent Act would not come to the aid of a "tenant­ in ­sufferance" vis­à­vis SARFAESI Act due to the operation of Section 13(2) read with Section 13(13) of the SARFAESI Act. In this case, the court observed that there is a serious doubt as to the bona fide of the tenant, as there is no good or sufficient evidence to establish the tenancy.
"The appellant has pleaded tenancy from 12.06.2012 to 17.12.2018. This is not supported by any registered instrument. Further, even according to the appellant, he is a "tenant­ in­ sufferance", therefore, he is not entitled to any protection of the Rent Act. Secondly, even if the tenancy has been claimed to be renewed in terms of Section 13(13) of the SARFAESI Act, the Borrower would be required to seek consent of the secured creditor for transfer of the Secured Asset by way of sale, lease or otherwise, after issuance of the notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act and, admittedly, no such consent has been sought by the Borrower in the present case", the court said while dismissing the appeal.

On a plea of students of Faculty of Law, University of Delhi, seeking cancellation of the 4th-semester exams, the Delhi High Court on Tuesday (June 1) issued Notice to University of Delhi, Bar Council of India, and University Grants Commission.
The Bench of Justice Prateek Jalan asked the University about the arrangements which it is making to ensure that the Covid-19 affected students and the students who are unable to clear the examinations and those who seek to improve their marks, are given a second opportunity to take the aforesaid fourth-semester examinations within a reasonable time frame.
The matter before the Court
It was averred before the Court that UGC, by a notification dated April 29, 2020, permitted the evaluation of the intermediate semester students i.e. students who were not in the final year, by a combination of marks obtained in the internal evaluation and past performance [50% on the basis of internal assessment and 50% on the basis of performance in the previous semester].
Thus, the University adopted this course for most of its courses. However, it was submitted that the BCI, by a series of notifications, commencing from June 9, 2020, and terminating with a notification dated November 1, 2020, directed all the law colleges to hold examinations for the intermediate semesters also.
In pursuant to this, the Faculty of Law released a Notification dated May 31, 2021, citing the BCI Press Release dated November 11, 2020 and announcing that the 4th-semester examination for the current final year students would be held from 15th July onwards.
Arguments put forth
It was submitted that although the UGC notification dated April 29, 2020 does not contain any prohibition on holding of examinations in respect of intermediate semesters, but, it was added that the approach of the University was inconsistent with the interests of students in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic
It was submitted that several students have suffered illness, loss in their families, financial hardships in the family, and have been burdened with responsibilities far beyond those which fall upon them in normal times
The Petitioners informed the Court that the BCI Press Release dated November 1, 2020, had already been quashed by the Karnataka High Court
. The Petitioners submitted that therefore, there is no basis for the Faculty of Law anymore to hold examinations for the 4th semester, especially since it had failed to evaluate the students for the 4th semester for over one year, and that the college ought to proceed as per the UGC Guidelines in the interest of students. 
The issue of a student of 6th semester
It was pointed out during the course of the hearing that, the University had announced that, as far as the petitioners' batch of students (6th semester) is concerned, the examinations would commence from June 14, 2021.
Further, the pending examinations of the fourth semester (which the petitioners would ordinarily have taken in the academic session 2019-20), will be tentatively scheduled around July 15, 2021.
In this backdrop, it was argued that the procedure of holding the sixth-semester examinations first would be detrimental to the students in the position of the petitioners as in the event, a student requires or desires to repeat any of the fourth-semester papers, that opportunity will be available to him/her only after one year when the fourth-semester examinations are next held in the regular course.
Submission made by BCI and the University
The counsel for the BCI, submitted that it had set up a committee headed by a former Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court and comprising the heads of law faculties in various universities, to deliberate upon the nature of the evaluation.

Dealing with the plea of an inter-religious couple who alleged that private respondent/s is interfering with their marital life and liberty, the Allahabad High Court on Tuesday clarified that the fact of the petitioner (Girl) having converted to Islam would not be a relevant factor while ensuring that there is no interference in the liberty of the petitioners.
The Bench of Justice Salil Kumar Rai was hearing the plea of a Girl (aged 20 years who converted to Islam) and Man (aged 40 years) and they sought direction upon the respondents not to interfere with their marital life and liberty. 
They claimed that they are major and have solemnized marriage out of their own free will and also alleged that private respondent/s is interfering with their marital life and liberty.
Referring to the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Lata Singh Vs. State of U.P., AIR 2006 SC 2522, the Court observed that Law is settled that it is the right of couples to live peacefully without any interference in case they are major. 
Further, the court observed that in view of the clear enunciation of law by the Apex Court in Lata Singh's case, it is obligatory for the concerned authorities to ensure compliance of the above directions in view of Article 141 of the Constitution of India. 
The Court said that in case petitioners face any genuine threat to their life and liberty, or they are harassed, contrary to the law laid down in Lata Singh, it shall be open for them to approach the Senior Superintendent of Police of the District concerned and furnish necessary details in that regard, like proof of their majority, marriage and alleged harassment etc., who shall take all steps as may be required in law to ensure that petitioners' life and liberty are not interfered with,
Significantly, the Court also clarified:
"That petitioners, if major, are entitled to live together even if not married and, therefore, proof of their marriage would not be required and shall not be insisted upon by the concerned Police Officer. It is further clarified that the fact of the petitioner having converted to Islam would not be a relevant factor while ensuring that there is no interference in the liberty of the petitioners unless there is any allegation by petitioner no.1 regarding forcible conversion."

The Supreme Court has directed the Ministry of Home Affairs to secure the presence of fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya to serve the 4 months imprisonment imposed on him for contempt of court.
In an order pronounced today, a bench led by Justice UU Lalit had imposed a sentence of 4 months imprisonment and a fine of Rs 2000 on Mallya for committing contempt of country by willful disobedience of court directions. The fine shall be deposited in the Registry of this Court within four weeks and upon such deposit, the amount shall be made over to the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee. In case the amount of fine is not deposited within the time stipulated, the Contemnor shall undergo further sentence of two months.
Apart from the above, the Court directed the Union Government to secure Mallya's presence to serve the sentence.
"We direct the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, New Delhi to secure the presence of the Contemnor to undergo the imprisonment imposed upon him. Needless to say, Government of India including the Ministry of External Affairs and all other agencies or instrumentalities shall carry out the directions issued by this Court with due diligence and utmost expediency. A Compliance Report shall thereafter be filed in the Registry of this Court", the Court ordered.
He was found guilty in 2017 for transferring USD 40 million to his children in violation of the orders passed in a case filed by a consortium of banks led by the State Bank of India. Mallya, an accused in bank loan default case of over Rs 9,000 crore involving his defunct Kingfisher Airlines, is in the United Kingdom.
During the sentence hearing, the Union of India had informed the Court that though extradition of Mallya from the United Kingdom has been allowed, he could not be brought to India in view of some "secret" proceedings pending against him there, the details of which are not known to the Union Government.
Although the Court deferred the sentence hearing few times to give an opportunity to Mallya to appear, it ultimately decided to proceed in his absence in view of his refusal to appear. Senior Advocate Jaideep Gupta was appointed as an amicus curiae in the case to assist the court in the in absentia hearing.
Pronouncing the sentence today, the Court said that Mallya did not show any remorse for his conduct and did not appear before it during the sentence hearing. The Court added that adequate sentence must be imposed on him to "uphold the majesty of law" and that directions need to be issued to ensure that the amount in dispute is available for execution of the orders. Therefore, the Court has directed Mallya to deposit 40 million US Dollars with 8 percent interest within 4 weeks with the concerned recovery officer, failing which attachment proceedings will be initiated against his properties.
If not deposited, the recovery officer shall take appropriate proceedings for recovery of the amount and the Government of India and its agencies shall provide assistance and complete cooperation. Mallya's transfer of 40 million to beneficiaries in breach of court orders has been declared "void and inoperative".
Case Title : State Bank of India and others vs Dr.Vijay Mallya
Contempt of Courts Act 1971- Vijay Mallya sentenced to 4 months imprisonment and Rs 2000 fine for contempt of court for disobedience of court orders- It is, well settled that apart from punishing the contemnor for his contumacious conduct, the majesty of law may demand that appropriate directions be issued by the court so that any advantage secured as a result of such contumacious conduct is completely nullified. The approach may require the court to pass directions either for reversal of the transactions in question by declaring said transactions to be void or passing appropriate directions to the concerned authorities to see that the contumacious conduct on the part of the contemnor does not continue to enure to the advantage of the contemnor or any one claiming under him- In a given case, to meet the ends of justice, the concept of purging of the contempt would call for complete disgorging of all the benefits secured as a result of actions which are found by the court to be contumacious - Para 13

The Calcutta High Court has recently observed that the right to equality enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution does not mean giving equal treatment or equal protection of the law to persons who are unequals and that its violation would entail giving iniquitous treatment to persons falling within the same bracket despite their homogeneous characteristics.
Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya was adjudicating upon a plea seeking cancellation of amendments made to the West Bengal School Service Commission (Selection for appointment to the Posts of Headmaster/Headmistress in Secondary or Higher Secondary and Junior High Schools) Rules, 2016 as notified on March 24, 2017 and all subsequent Notifications issued thereafter to the extent of imposing enhanced qualifications for selection of Headmasters/Headmistresses in Secondary, Higher Secondary and Junior High Schools.
The petitioners who are Assistant Teachers of High Schools in the State contended that the impugned notification violates Article 14 of the Constitution as it enhances the qualification for selection to the post of Headmaster/Headmistress from 45% to 50% in academic and professional qualifications. 
Pursuant to the rival submissions, Justice Bhattacharya underscored that if Article 14 (right to equality) and Article 16 (equal opportunity in matters of public employment) are to be given a meaningful and mutually-purposive interpretation, the object would be to uphold and preserve equitable distribution of opportunities within a class of persons marked by well-defined characteristics. It was further stated that such an object cannot be to treat persons across all spectrums as equals but to first segregate the spectrums according to the special features of each and ensure that persons within these individual groups are not treated discriminated against.
"A complaint of violation of the guarantee of equality can be taken to its equitable conclusion provided there is iniquitous treatment of persons falling within the same bracket despite their homogeneous characteristics. A classification based on grouping of persons based on similar and identifiable markers will withstand judicial scrutiny if the class of persons are distinct and different from those excluded from the class. The differential attributes of those within and those outside must be clear so as to demolish any charge of unequal treatment of persons within and outside the group", the Court enumerated. 
Addressing the contention of the petitioners, the Court opined that the argument that the Headmasters/Headmistresses are not being subjected to the qualifying percentage of 50% which has been brought about by the impugned Notification is fallacious. It was noted that there is no natural or automatic progression/promotion from the post of Assistant Teachers to Headmasters and that an Assistant Teacher would have to put himself/herself through a selection process for qualifying to the post of Headmaster/Headmistress which shows that the two positions are therefore conceptually and functionally different.
Moreover, it was observed that since the impugned Notification is prospective in nature, there can be no scope of a person who is presently holding the post of a Headmaster/Headmistress being subjected to the eligibility criterion of 50% marks in Master's Degree from a recognized University at the post-graduate level.
 Justice Bhattacharya further averred that the two classes of teachers i.e. teachers appointed by the School Service Commission and those by the Public Service Commission are distinct and disparate from each other since the mode and manner of selection as well as appointing authorities are wholly different. Thus, the petitioners cannot complain of unequal treatment between these two groups of teachers since the two classes are based on well-defined characteristics and are distinct from each other.
Enumerating further upon what constitutes 'reasonable classification' under Article 14 of the Constitution, the Court underscored, 
"The safeguard in Article 14 of the Constitution is to prevent discriminatory treatment of persons who claim to be equals; the right does not mean giving equal treatment or equal protection of the law to persons who are unequals and would hence require differential treatment for preserving their unique and individual characteristics. The image which comes to mind is of 3 persons of unequal height being given 3 ladders to see beyond a wall; the idea is not to give 3 equal-sized ladders to the 3 persons but giving the tallest ladder to the shortest person and the shortest ladder to the tallest person so that all 3 can look beyond the wall (wishfully at a brighter and more equal future)."
The Court thus held that the impugned Notification has a rationale and a most credible nexus with the object of upgrading the standard of teachers who are to be recruited as Headmasters/Headmistresses and that requiring a higher academic classification for the post of Headmaster/Headmistress cannot be said to be violative either in logic or in practice.
Accordingly, the Court upheld the constitutionality validity of the impugned notification by observing, 
"It should also be recognized that the benchmark required for recruitment to certain posts, particularly of teachers including Headmasters, has to be raised from time to time in sync with the evolving academic performance indicators in the State. Eligibility criteria cannot remain frozen or static for all times to come. A timely step for an upward revision can never be taken if a spanner is thrown every time the State seeks to change the benchmark eligibility criteria for recruitment to certain posts, particularly in schools and colleges."

The Supreme Court observed that it is the responsibility of the Government should endeavour to keep taxation regime convenient and simple.
Just as the Government does not wish for avoidance of tax equally it is the responsibility of the regime to design a tax system for which a subject can budget and plan, the bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy observed.
The court said that if proper balance is achieved between these, unnecessary litigation can be avoided without compromising on generation of revenue.
The court was considering the appeals filed by various banks in which the issue raised was whether Section 14A of the Income Tax Act enables the Department to make disallowance on expenditure incurred for earning tax free income in cases where assessees do not maintain separate accounts for the investments and other expenditures incurred for earning the tax-free income.
Section 14A deals with expenditure incurred in relation to income not includible in total income. It provides for disallowance of expenditure incurred by the assessee in relation to income, which does not form part of their total income. If the assessee incurs any expenditure for earning tax free income such as interest paid for funds borrowed, for investment in any business which earns tax free income, the assessee is disentitled to deduction of such interest or other expenditure.
In this case, the Assessing Officer made proportionate disallowance of interest attributable to the funds invested to earn tax free income. The ITAT, allowing assessee's appeal, held that disallowance under Section 14A is not warranted, in absence of clear identity of funds. This was reversed by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) and later by the High Court and thus the assessee banks approached the Apex Court.
The appellant banks contended that investments made in bonds and shares should be considered to have been made out of interest free funds which were substantially more than the investment made and therefore the interest paid by the assessee on its deposits and other borrowings, should not be considered to be expenditure incurred in relation to tax free income on bonds and shares and as a corollary, there should be no disallowance under Section 14A of the Act.
Referring to earlier judgments, the court held that the proportionate disallowance of interest is not warranted, under Section 14A of Income  Tax Act for investments made in tax free bonds/ securities which yield tax free dividend and interest to Assessee Banks in those situations where, interest free own funds available with the Assessee, exceeded their investments.
While concluding the bench quoted Adam Smith (from his seminal work Wealth of Nations): "The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person."
The court said:
Echoing what was said by the 18th century economist, it needs to be observed here that in taxation regime, there is no room for presumption and nothing can be taken to be implied. The tax an individual or a corporate is required to pay, is a matter of planning for a tax payer and the Government should endeavour to keep it convenient and simple to achieve maximization of compliance. Just as the Government does not wish for avoidance of tax equally it is the responsibility of the regime to design a tax system for which a subject can budget and plan. If proper balance is achieved between these, unnecessary litigation can be avoided without compromising on generation of revenue:

The Supreme Court (4:1) in its judgment upholding validity of demonetisation, observed that the word “recommendation” in Section 26(2) of RBI Act would mean a consultative process between the Central Board of Reserve Bank of India and the Central Government.
"Merely because the Central Government has advised the Central Board to consider recommending demonetization and that the Central Board, on the advice of the Central Government, has considered the proposal for demonetization and recommended it and, thereafter, the Central Government has taken a decision, in our view, cannot be a ground to hold that the procedure prescribed under Section 26 of the RBI Act was breached.", the majority comprising of Justices S. Abdul Nazeer, B R Gavai, A S Bopanna and V. Ramasubramanian observed.
Section 26(2) of the RBI Act reads thus: On recommendation of the Central Board, the Central Government may, by notification in the Gazette of India, declare that, with effect from such date as may be specified in the notification, any series of bank notes of any denomination shall cease to be legal tender save at such office or agency of the Bank and to such extent as may be specified in the notification.”
The contention raised by the petitioners was that the procedure prescribed under Section 26(2) is breached as the proposal has emanated from the Central Government whereas the requirement is that the proposal should emanate from the Central Board. 
The majority judgment observed that the two requirements of sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act are (i) recommendation by the Central Board; and (ii) the decision by the Central Government.
“recommendation” would mean a consultative process
"The scheme mandates that before the Central Government takes a decision with regard to demonetization, it would be required to consider the recommendation of the Central Board. We find that, in the context in which it is used, the word “recommendation” would mean a consultative process between the Central Board and the Central Government"
It cannot be said that there was no conscious, effective, meaningful and purposeful consultation
As such, the enquiry would be limited to find out whether both the Central Board and the Central Government had made their respective points of view known to each other and discussed and examined the relative merits of their views. It will have to be considered whether each of the party had disclosed to the other all relevant facts and factors for due deliberation, or not. The limited enquiry would be whether the recommendation by the Central Board was made after complete consideration of the matter on the basis of all the relevant facts and material before it, or not.. As already discussed herein above, the record itself reveals that the RBI and the Central Government were in consultation with each other for a period of six months before the impugned notification was issued. The record would also reveal that all the relevant information was shared by both the Central Board as well as the Central Government with each other. As such, it cannot be said that there was no conscious, effective, meaningful and purposeful consultation.
Justice BV Nagarathna's dissent
RBI Act does not envisage initiation of demonetisation of bank notes by the Central Government. 
Justice Nagarathna observed that the majority judgment does not recognise the essential fact that the Act does not envisage initiation of demonetisation of bank notes by the Central Government. 
"The essential ingredients of sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the Act can be epitomised as under: i) on the recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank; ii) the Central Government by notification in the Gazette of India; iii) may declare any series of bank notes of any denomination to cease to be legal tender; iv) with effect from such date as may be specified in the notification; v) to such extent as may be specified in the notification; Therefore, under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the Act, the Central Government would act only on the recommendation made by the Central Board of the Bank, which is the initiator of demonetisation of bank notes.", the judge observed
Initiation on the strength of Entry 36 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution
The judge agreed with the submission of Attorney General that the Central Government cannot be said to be without powers in initiating demonetisation of bank notes.
"This is on the strength of Entry 36 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. The Central Government is not just concerned with the financial health of the country as well as its economy, but it is also concerned with the sovereignty and integrity of India; the security of the State; the defence of the country; its friendly relations with foreign countries; internal and external security and various other aspects of governance. On the other hand, the Bank is only concerned with the regulation of currency notes, monetary policy framework, maintaining price stability and allied matters. Therefore, if the Central Government is of the considered opinion that in order to meet certain objectives such as the ones stated in the impugned notification, namely, to eradicate black money, fake currency, terror funding etc., it is necessary to demonetise the currency notes in circulation, then the Central Government may initiate a proposal for demonetisation."
Justice Nagarathna added that demonetisation of the entire series of currency notes cannot be done by the Central Government by issuing a notification under Section 26(2) of the RBI Act, as it gives power only to cancel a specified series of notes. The dissenting judge also opined that the RBI did not independently apply its mind regarding the Centre's proposal for demonetisation and that the entire exercise was done in 24 hours.

The Madras High Court recently reiterated that a bail court, while considering an application under Section 167(2) CrPC was not concerned with going into the merits of the case. The court had to consider such an application for default bail by considering whether the statutory period for filing a charge sheet or challan had expires, whether the charge sheet or challan had been filed and whether the accused was prepared to and had furnished bail.
 Justice Murali Shankar, while setting aside the decision of the lower court, also criticized the order passed by the Sessions Judge. The court expressed shock over the manner in which the impugned order was passed and the personal liberty of the accused was handled by the Judicial Officer.
 This Court is at loss to understand that the Sessions Judge, who is having 19 years of experience in judicial service, has over looked the legal provisions and the legal dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court and the way he played with the personal liberty of the appellant/accused, completely oblivious of a basic provision, which every Officer dealing in criminal cases comes across day in and day out. 
 The court pointed out that apart from experience, this legal knowledge was also being continuously imparted through State Judicial Academy. Thus, finding the conduct of the officer unacceptable, the court directed the Registry to call for an explanation from the concerned Judicial Officer.
 Hence, the Registry is directed to call for an explanation from the concerned Officer in this regard. 
 The court also highlighted that personal liberty was an important aspect of our constitutional mandate. The court discussed the view taken by the Supreme Court in Rakesh Kumar Paul v. State ofAssam (2017) where the Apex Court had held that in matters of personal liberty, we cannot and should not be too technical and must lean in favour of the personal liberty and that in matters of personal liberty under Article 21 of Constitution of India, it is not always advisable to be formalistic or technical
 The accused, who was the sole accused in a crime for the offences under Section 376(2)(n), 417, 506(i) IPC and Section 3(1)(w)(i), 3(2)(v) of SC/SC (POA) Act 1989, had moved for regular bail under Section 439 CrPC but the same was dismissed. Though he preferred an appeal, the High Court dismissed the same.
 Subsequently, the accused filed another application under Section 167(2) CrPC which was dismissed by the Sessions Court. This impugned order was under challenge in the present case. 
 The High Court noted that even a bare perusal of the impugned order would show that the Sessions Judge had passed the order as if the petition was on for regular bail and not one under Section 167(2) CrPC. The Sessions Judge had failed to consider the judicial precedents laid down by the Supreme Court in the decision of Uday Mohanlal Acharya v.State of Maharashtra (2001) and even recently in M Ravindran v The IntelligenceOfficer, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (2021) wherein the courts have discussed the manner in which the Magistrate/court had to deal with applications for statutory bail under Section 167(2) CrPC.
 Even in Madras High Court, in the decision of K. Muthuirul v. The Inspector of Police, Samayanallur (2022) had held that the bail Court while considering the bail under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C., is having no power or jurisdiction to go into the merits of the case and to see as to whether the ingredients necessary for granting regular bail are available or not.
 In the present case, since the final report had not been filed even after expiry of the statutory period of 90 days. Thus, the Sessions Judge had no other option but to grant the statutory bai. In view of the same, the court released the appellant/accused on statutory bail with conditions

The Supreme Court has held that prior sanction of the Magistrate is not mandatory for investigating a non-cognizable offence along with a cognizalbe offence.
A bench comprising Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna held so while dealing with an appeal against a judgment of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, which quashed an FIR for offences under under the J&K Prevention of Corruption Act and criminal conspiracy under Section 120B of the Ranbir Penal Code. The High Court, among other grounds, had quashed the FIR observing that prior sanction of the Magistrate as per Section 155 of the J&K Code of Criminal Procedure was not obtained for investigating the offence of criminal conspiracy, which was non-cognizable as per the Ranbir Penal Code. The High Court also held the delay in completing preliminary enquiry as a reason to quash the case.
The Supreme Court held that the High Court erred in holding that sanction of Magistrate was required to investigate the non-cognizable offence( in this case Section 120B RPC), as the offences under the PC Act were cognizable.
The Supreme Court noted that the the offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act is a substantive offence. When the investigation in respect of the offence under the PC Act, is coupled with the offence of conspiracy, there is no requirement of prior sanction of the Magistrate.
It was held that the High Court's view was contrary to the decision of the Supreme Court in Pravin Chandra Mody v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 1965 (1) SCR 269, wherein it was held that prior sanction under Section 155 CrPC was not needed when the non-cognizalbe offence is being jointly investigated along with a cognizable offence.
With regards High Court quashing the proceedings on failure to obtain prior sanction u/s 155 of J & K CrPC , the bench said that,
"The offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act is a substantive offence and the investigation in respect of the offence under the PC Act, when considered and coupled with the offence of conspiracy, there is no requirement of prior sanction of the Magistrate. Merely because the offence of the conspiracy may be involved,investigation into the substantive offence, i.e in the present case, offence under the PC Act which is cognizable is not required to await a sanction from the Magistrate, as that would lead to a considerable delay and affect the investigation and it will derail the investigation."
"Therefore, the High Court has erred in quashing the criminal proceedings on theground that as the offence under Section 120B which is a non-cognizable, prior sanction as required under Section 155 of J&K Cr.P.C.is not obtained. The view taken by the High Court is just contrary to the law laid down by this Court in the case of Pravin Chandra Mody (supra),which has been subsequently relied upon by this Court in the cases of Brij Lal Palta (supra); Satya Narain Musadi (supra); Madan Lal (supra);and Bhanwar Singh (supra)".

The Orissa High Court has upheld a notification issued by the Government of Odisha, which compulsorily retired a Chief Judicial Magistrate ('CJM') from his service, citing the step to have been taken 'in public interest'. 
While affirming such notification, a Division Bench of Chief Justice Dr. S. Muralidhar and Justice Radha Krishna Pattanaik also held that compulsory retirement is not a punishment; thus, there is no need to give prior hearing to the concerned officer before notifying such retirement.
 It observed,
 "It is now well settled that compulsory retirement is not a punishment and the necessity of giving a hearing to the Petitioner prior to such decision being taken does not arise. This has been explained in a large number of cases including Baikuntha Nath Das v. Chief District Medical Officer, Baripada, (1992) 2 SCC 299…"
 Facts of the Case:
 The petitioner was successful in the Odisha Judicial Service (OJS) examination conducted by the Odisha Public Service Commission and was appointed as Munsif (on probation) in OJS-II, Puri and joined in that post on 16th February, 1987. He became a Judicial Magistrate First Class on 14th March, 1989 and served in various locations in the State. He was promoted as Senior Civil Judge in 2005 and posted at Rourkela by an order dated 28th October, 2005.
 In terms of the relevant provisions of the Orissa Superior Judicial Service and Orissa Judicial Service Rules, 2007 ('the 2007 Rules'), the petitioner was continued in service after attaining the age of 50 years. By a Notification dated 7th July 2010, he was posted as CJM, Baripada. In 2012, on attaining the age of 55 years, he was allowed to continue as CJM, Baripada. He was then transferred as CJM, Jharsuguda by a Notification dated 18th July, 2013. 
 Subsequently, at the meeting of the Review Committee held on 6th October 2015, it was decided to recommend to the High Court the petitioner's compulsory retirement in 'public interest'. The Full Court accepted the recommendation at its meeting on 15th October, 2015. The consequential notification compulsory retiring the petitioner was issued by the Government on 5th November, 2015. 
 Thus, the petitioner approached the High Court and challenged the aforesaid notification which compulsorily retired him.
 Contentions of the Petitioner:
 Mr. Budhadev Routray, Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner, submitted that throughout the career of the petitioner his performance was found satisfactory and that is the reason why he was retained in service on attaining the ages of 50 and 55 years in terms of Rule 44 of the 2007 Rules. Further, he submitted that in terms of Rule 41 of the 2007 Rules, the provisions of the Orissa Civil Services [OCS] (CCA) Rule, 1962 shall mutatis mutandis apply to the members of the OSJS and OJS. It was his contention that as far as the petitioner is aware, there is not a single adverse entry in his CCRs, so as to hold that his continuation in service would be against public interest. 
 He further argued that if at all the Review Committee was of the view that the continuance of the Petitioner beyond 58 years was against public interest and, therefore, he should be removed from service prematurely then in terms of Rule 41 of the 2007 Rules, he ought to have been given a hearing.
 Contentions of the Respondents:
 Mr. Pravat Kumar Muduli, Additional Government Advocate appearing for the Opposite Parties, submitted that the service record of the petitioner shows that the recommendation of the Review Committee, which was accepted by the Full Court is justified. While it was correct that the petitioner was retained in service on attaining the ages of 50 and 55, it is not correct that there was no allegation at all against him during that period. 
 He submitted that although an Inquiry Report was submitted in the Departmental Enquiry, it was never acted upon since it was decided to prematurely retire the petitioner. He clarified that the action taken under Rule 44 is not a punishment unlike disciplinary action taken under [OCS] (CCA) Rule, 1962. The Rule 44 of the 2007 Rules is an independent provision and does not contemplate the giving of an opportunity of hearing. Further, the order of compulsory retirement is not a punishment and, therefore, principles of natural justice were not attracted.
 He further pointed out that the impugned decision was taken on over all consideration of not only CCRs of the relevant period under review but the entire record of service, the personal files, overall performance, the yardstick as well as vigilance inputs including the aspect of integrity and suitability before taking the decision in the matter. Public interest was definitely of paramount importance. It was his vehement contention that the mere fact that he was allowed to cross the efficiency bar and granted ACP would not itself lead to the conclusion that his service was satisfactory and that there was no basis for the decision to retire him on his reaching the age of 58.
 Court's Observations:
 The Court noted that the entire service record of the petitioner was carefully perused by the Court. The CCRs of the petitioner for the years 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1998, 1999, 2006, 2011 and 2014 reveal that in all these years he got the 'Average' grading and an adverse remark in 1990 was communicated to him as were the adverse remarks for 1992, 1994 and 1995. In some of these years, the Reviewing Authority has remarked that his knowledge of law was 'Average' and that "he needs improvement" and also that he should "improve upon English". 
 The Court noted that the conduct of departmental proceedings and the submission of the report of enquiry appear to have taken some time. By the time the inquiry report was placed before the Full Court, the petitioner's case for continuation after the age of 58 came up for consideration and the impugned decision was taken.
 The Court then explained the procedure involved in taking decisions of compulsory retirements. The decision whether to continue an officer in service after attaining the age of 50, 55 and 58 is taken at two levels: At the first level, there is a Review Committee comprising of Senior Judges of the High Court including the Chief Justice, which carefully peruses the entire service record of the officer. Thereafter, it recommends to the Full Court whether such officer should be retained in service. At the second level, the recommendation of the Review Committee is deliberated in the Full Court and then a final decision is taken in that regard. 
 The Bench clarified that this is the precise procedure that was followed in the present case. In taking the decision to compulsorily retire the petitioner, the Full Court kept in view the legal principles as explained in S. Ramachandra Raju v. State of Orissa (1994).
 The Court further reaffirmed the principle, as has been settled by the Apex Court in number of cases, that compulsory retirement is not a punishment and the necessity of giving a hearing to the petitioner prior to such decision being taken does not arise. 
 Accordingly, the petition was dismissed.

Allahabad High Court on Monday issued certain guidelines/safeguards to prevent the misuse of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
 One of the guidelines issued by the Court states that after the registration of a First Information Report (FIR) under 498A IPC, no arrest or coercive action should be taken against the accused during the cooling-off period of two months.
 During this period, the Court has ordered that the issue should be referred to a Family Welfare Committee (FWC). It may be noted Section 498-A punishes a woman's husband or his relatives if they subject her to cruelty.
 While issuing the safeguards, the Bench of Justice Rahul Chaturvedi was of the view that the traditional fragrance of our age-old institution of marriage would completely evaporate over a period of time if gross and unmindful misuse of section 498-A IPC would keep on happening rampantly.
 The case in brief
 Essentially, the Court was hearing revision petitions filed by 3 persons (in-laws of the complainant) challenging an order of the Sessions court rejecting their discharge applications in connection with an offence registered against them including various sections of IPC including Section 498A.
 This FIR had been lodged by the wife against her husband and in-laws, wherein she alleged, inter alia, that his father-in-law wanted to have sexual favors from her, and not only this, but her brother-in-law also have tried to ravish her physically. 
 She also alleged that her husband used to lock her in the bathroom after taking away her mobile phone and her mother-in-law and sister-in-law pressurized her to get aborted. On making their refusal, all the family members became physical with her. 
 It was further alleged that a constant demand was made for additional dowry and on her refusal, she was assaulted brutally by fists and kicks and maltreated and humiliated to its optimum.
 Court's observations 
 At the outset, taking into account the story narrated in the FIR by the wife, the Court said that the FIR was not only abhorring, but full of dirt, filth, and venomous accusations against her own husband and in­laws.
 "The graphic and vivid descriptions of the incident without any shame or hitch of any sort, speaks out the volume of mental condition and amount of venom and poison in the mind of the informant. She without mincing any word, rather exaggerating the incident to manifolds, had committed the snide before the Court," the Court remarked.
 Further, the Court found no fault with the order of the lower court discharging the accused as the Court was of the view that the wife/victim had been unable to substantiate allegations made by her even at the time of investigation and these allegations were found false.
 The Court also recorded its strongest exception to the type of language used by the informant in the FIR. 
 "The language of the FIR should be a decent one and no amount of atrocities faced by the informant would justify her to use such type of caustic expressions. FIR/complaint is the gateway of any criminal case even soft and decent expression would well communicate the alleged atrocities faced by her," the Court said.
 Consequently, the revision petitions of the in-laws were allowed, however, Husband's revision plea was rejected.
 Now, regarding the misuse of Section 498A IPC by the wife, the Court opined that nowadays, every matrimonial case is being exaggerated manifold with all the pungent and caustic allegations of dowry-related atrocities involving the husband and all family members
 Thus, assessing the totality of the circumstances, object and the allegation of misuse of Section 498A IPC, the Court went on to propose the safeguards after taking the guidance from the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Social Action Forum for Manav Adhikar Vs. Union of India with a view to keep the growing tendency in the masses to nail the husband and all family members by a general and sweeping allegations.
 (i)No arrest or police action to nab the named accused persons shall be made after lodging of the FIR or complaints without concluding the "Cooling-Period" which is two months from the lodging of the FIR or the complaint.

 Case title - Mukesh Bansal v State of UP

The Calcutta High Court has recently set aside the nominations made to post-graduate medical courses in the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGEM&R) by a private Trust by opining that such a process turns a blind eye to merit and that it would entail the public being on the receiving end of sponsoring future-doctors without knowing whether they are the best of the pick.
Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya was adjudicating upon a batch of petitions which contended that the nominations made by the Rai Bahadur Seth Sukhlal Karnani Chandanmull Karnani Trust to post-graduate medical courses to the IPGEM&R which is a Government hospital were made dehors the Medical Council of India Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000 (MCI Regulations, 2000). 
It was further contended that the people nominated by the private Trust had scored lower marks compared to the petitioners in NEET–PG, 2021 and hence their nominations were contrary to the MCI Regulations, 2000.
Pursuant to the rival submissions, the Court noted that the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 as amended and the Post-graduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000, particularly Regulation 9 thereunder, not only reinforce a unitary and single-point entry for admission to PG medical courses by way of a common eligibility test, but also that the order of merit cannot be tinkered with. It was further opined that that the method of assessment used by the Trust remains shrouded in secrecy. 
Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court judgment in Christian Medical College, Vellore Association v. Union of India wherein the Apex Court had had cautioned against individual examinations conducted by institutions and had further observed that the system is riddled with unscrupulous elements encouraging dubious means to be adopted to defeat merit. 
Opining that there seems to be a parallel selection process outside the recommended statutory framework, the Court underscored, 
"There is no intelligible benchmark disclosed by the Trust as to the reason why the private respondents were recommended for admission despite having lower ranks compared to the petitioners in the NEET - PG Test. The assessment hence is a parallel selection process outside the recommended statutory framework and is subversive of the Act and the Regulations. The Trust has not only turned a blind eye to merit but has doffed its hat to the dilution of merit. The State is hence precluded by law to accept the recommendations."
The Court also observed that such an exclusive selection of candidates which is unmonitored within the recommended guidelines would have particularly dangerous ramifications when the selection pertains to doctors and medical officers. It was further opined that the existing statutory framework was devised to safeguard the transparency of the selection process and to prevent random picking of candidates through parallel channels without due regard to the merit position of the unified examination test. 
Reference was also made to the Supreme Court judgment in Faculty Association of All India Institute of Medical Sciences v. Union of India wherein it had been held that there could be no compromise with merit at the superspeciality stage. 
Opining that the public should not bear the brunt of doctors who have received admission without merit, the Court enumerated, 
"A distinction should be made between the facts of this case and awards and scholarships given by private bodies, some of which are globally recognised. These instances of private rewards/sponsorship are not governed by a unitary statutory framework regulating the selection and admission of the candidates. These are essentially private grants for sponsoring the particular course, that is, the private body is itself the sponsorer. Not only is the present case concerned with a statute governing the admission of candidates to medical courses without any deviation from the same being permitted, the Trust's obligations ends with the recommendations. It is the State which bankrolls the recommended candidates. The burden is ultimately hence on the public who are ironically put at the receiving end of sponsoring future-doctors without knowing whether they are the best of the pick."
Accordingly, the Court set aside the nominations made by the respondents. 
Case Title: Sri Daksh Singhal & Ors v. The State of West Bengal and Others

In a recent decision, the Telangana High Court upheld the conviction of a husband under section 498A of Indian Penal Code despite there being contradictions in the dying declarations as there were consistent statements about abuse and cruelty committed on the wife in all the dying declarations.
"Both these statements are consistent with regard to the quarrel ensued between the deceased and A1 and that he came in drunken condition, abused her and came upon to beat her. Unable to bear the same, she poured kerosene oil from the stove on her body and set herself ablaze, which is sufficient to attract the ingredients of Section 498-A IPC. Even after removing the exaggerations, the statement of the deceased in Exs.P4 and P11 is consistent with regard to the harassment and cruelty met by her in the hands of A1 which drove her to commit suicide. As such, this Court does not find any illegality or impropriety in the judgment of the trial court in coming to the conclusion about the guilt of the Accused No.1 for the offence under Section 498-A IPC."
The appellant herein is accused for burning his wife to death by pouring kerosene on her. The accused was held guilty of cruelty against his wife under Section 498A by the Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Secunderabad and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 1 year and fine of rupees 1000. The appeal was filed against the decision of the trial court.
 The wife of the accused/appellant was admitted to the hospital with fatal burn injuries. She had sustained 40% burn injuries. While undergoing treatment, the wife died and the autopsy confirmed that the cause of death was "shock due to burns". Before her death, the wife had given four dying declarations stating the cause of her death.
 The appellant contended that the trial court had not considered the conflicting nature of the four dying declarations given by the deceased, each one was an improvement over the other and as consequence the benefit of doubt should be given to the accused. 
 The deceased had claimed in the first two dying declarations that she poured kerosene on herself and lit fire due to abusive, vulgar and harsh comments used by the accused. But in the later dying declarations, the deceased stated that the accused had poured kerosene and lit fire to her and used to harass her for dowry.
 Issue : Whether the conviction of accused for the offence under Section 498A IPC can be set aside due to inconsistencies in dying declarations?
 Ruling of the court
 Upon analysis of evidence on record, Dr. Justice G. Radha Rani observed that though the subsequent declarations were improvements of each other, one statement was consistent that the accused used to beat the victim after drinking and constantly demand dowry using vulgar and abusive language. Thus, the offence of Section 498A of IPC would be attracted due to consistent statement about harassment and cruelty by husband driving the deceased to commit suicide.
 "The presence of A1 was mentioned in the earlier statements made by the declarant and though there were developments in the subsequent statements, the deceased was specific in both Exs.P4 and P11 that A1 tried to beat her and used most vulgar language against her and the conduct of A1 in abusing the deceased would attract the provisions of Section 498-A IPC which would amount to cruelty defined in the Section driving the deceased to commit suicide"
The High Court did not find any irregularity in the trial court's findings and the criminal appeal was dismissed.
 Case Title: K.RAJKUMAR v. THE STATE OF A.P.

The Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a writ plea moved against the proposed removal of the Shahi Masjid located at G.T. Road, Saidabad (purportedly more than 100 years old) for the purposes of a state highway widening project. The bench of Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Sadhna Rani (Thakur) refused to entertain the plea moved Intezamia Committee Shahi Masjid by taking into account the submission made by the official authoritires that the Masjid is an encroachment on the government land. "Looking to the stand taken by the authorities in the written instruction supplied today and the enclosure appended therein and in view of the categorical stand of the respondents that the existing construction of Shahi Masjid situated on Prayagraj to Handia stretch of State Highway 106 is an encroachment on the government land namely Gata no.402 as per the report of the Sub Divisional Officer, Handia, Prayagraj, we are not in a position to issue mandamus as claimed by the petitioner herein," the Court observed. The Court further noted that the claim made by the petitioner and report submitted in that regard that the construction (Shahi Masjid) is existing for a long time i.e. since before the independence, was not backed by concrete data or material. "A perusal of the said report indicates that the report is based on the statement made by the people of the locality and there is no data or material which was looked into by the reporting officer before making the above statement with regard to the existence of Shahi Masjid." Essentially, the petitioner (Intezamia Committee Shahi Masjid) had moved to the Court challenging the decision to remove the entire Shahi Masjid located at G.T. Road, Saidabad. The Court had called for a response from the official authorities. Pursuant to court's order, last week the Standing Counsel submitted a report prepared by the office of the Executive Engineer Construction Division, Public Works Department wherein it was stated that the said Shahi Masjid is constructed on the Government land and therefore, it is an encroacment that was to be removed. To further substantiate its argument regarding the removal of the concerned mosque, the state respondents submitted that the widening of road has become unavoidable in national interest due to increasing traffic and accordingly, a decision has been taken that all the structures, whether new or old lying within State land boundary removal of which, for the widening of the road is unavoidable and those are an encroachment on the government land, be removed for the government project of road widening. Against this backdrop, it was submitted that the said Shahi Masjid is also an encroachment upon the state land and has to be removed for widening of the road. In view of these submission made by the state government, the Court observed that that since the dispute was about the title to the property over which the construction exists, therefore, the Court added, it was appropriate that for any claim with regard to the land over which Shahi Masjid exists, be taken up in the civil court by filing the civil suit seeking declaration or necessary relief in the same.

The Jharkhand High Court recently granted relief to the married daughter of a deceased employee who was denied compassionate employment by the Jharkhand Urja Vikash Nigam Limited.
 Justice S. N. Pathak observed that the case is an example where the applicant for compassionate appointment was "discriminated" on the ground of gender. 
The Petitioner submitted that the impugned order rejecting her claim suffers from gender bias, inasmuch as, if the son of the deceased employee comes within the zone of consideration for employment on compassionate ground, there is no reason as to why, the daughter, whether married or unmarried, should be excluded from the zone, if such daughter is fully dependent upon the deceased employee.
 The Court was informed that the claim of the petitioner was rejected after more than four years from the date of submission of the application, that too only on the ground of her being married daughter. It was submitted that though the petitioner is presently married, but at the time of submission of her application for compassionate appointment, she was unmarried, fully dependent upon the income of her mother. 
 It was further submitted that it is for the fault of respondents, the matter was decided after a long delay of more than four years, and for this act of arbitrariness on the part of the respondents, the petitioner cannot be victimized or be deprived of her rights under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.
 The counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents submitted that 'married daughters' do not come under the definition of dependent of the deceased employee and hence, no case is made out in favour of the petitioner. 
The Court noted that the submission of Respondents that married daughter do not come with the definition of dependent of the deceased employee, is not tenable in view of law laid down by catena of judicial pronouncements of the High Court as well as of the Supreme Court.
It referred to Madhubala Sinha Vs. M/s Central Coalfields Ltd & Ors.where it was held that held that when the brother of the deceased workman dying unmarried, if fully dependent upon the deceased employee, is entitled to be considered for appointment on compassionate ground, there is no reason as to why sister, whether married or unmarried, should be deprived of such benefits.
Similarly, in Smt. Asha Pandey Vs. Coal India Ltd., the Supreme Court declared as void a policy excluding married daughter from consideration for dependent employment.
The High Court accordingly directed respondent to consider the case of the petitioner for compassionate appointment in place of her deceased mother and pass appropriate orders for appointing her on compassionate ground, so that she could meet the situation of sudden death of sole bread-earner, who had left the family in penury and without means of livelihood.

Jayachandran while acquitting the father...
While dealing with a POCSO case where a father was accused of molesting his minor daughter, the Kerala High Court on Wednesday observed that false allegations of child molestation particularly against a parent can have a dangerous impact on the accused.
A Division Bench comprising Justice K Vinod Chandran and Justice C. Jayachandran while acquitting the father remarked: 
"Forensic and semantics apart, child molestation is a shame on society; but if the allegations are false, it is lethal to the life of the accused, more so if the accused is a parent; even if he is eventually acquitted. Here we have the case of a child raising such accusation against her father with the active support of the stepmother; sheer instigation by the latter, pleads the accused." 
The order came in an appeal filed by a man who was convicted by a trial court for molesting his daughter. He was booked upon his minor daughter accusing him of repeatedly sexually molesting and even committing penetrative assault on her. His wife, the girl's stepmother, claimed that the child had narrated the ordeal to her and thereafter a complaint was registered with the police.
Contentions Raised:
Amicus curiae in the case Advocate Sai Pooja challenged the conviction on several compelling grounds, particularly due to the prosecution's failure to produce vital documents before the Court. 
It was also brought to the notice of the Bench that the date of the alleged act was not specified and there was a delay in reporting the offence. Additionally, it was argued that there were clear discrepancies in the testimonies of the child and her stepmother themselves. Moreover, the medical evidence did not reveal any injury to genitals and there was absolutely no evidence of a penetrative sexual assault.
According to Supreme Court decision in Santosh Prasad @ Santosh Kumar v. State of Bihar when there are material contradictions in the evidence of the prosecutrix and when there is a delay in lodging the FIR, a conviction cannot be entered. 
As such, it was asserted that the embellishments in the testimonies of the step mother indicated her malafide intention to somehow remove the accused from the house.
On these grounds, the amicus argued that there was nothing to attract provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Assault (POCSO) Act as the age of the child was not proven by the prosecution as per law.
Special Government Pleader S Ambikadevi responded that the child's narration of molestation to the stepmother is res gestae under Section 6 of the Evidence Act. 
Then it was argued that the testimony of a rape victim has the same sanctity of an injured witness and can be solely relied on to base a conviction without any corroboration.
The Special GP further contended that the trial Judge had seen the child and that was enough proof of minority especially since the child was only seven years old.
Observations:
The Court refused to accept the contention that the trial judge had seen the victim and that would suffice. Moreover, the evidence of the certificate from the school that the child was studying in was also not from the school first attended as required under the POCSO Act.
The Court  relied on the decision in Alex v. State of Kerala in which it was held that the provision of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015 - Section 94(2) - requiring only a date of birth certificate from a school, cannot be imported to determine the age of a victim under the POCSO Act
It also referred to the judgement of the Supreme Court in Ravinder Singh Gorkhi v. State of U.P, which specifically spoke of the necessity and sufficiency of proof, to be the one available in the statute itself.
The Court opined that the benefit conferred on an accused in one statute, the JJ Act in this case, cannot be imported into another statute, the POCSO Act, so as to prejudice the accused in a prosecution under the other statute.
"In this context, we cannot but notice that the fundamental principles of criminal jurisprudence require every benefit to be conferred on the accused and no prejudice being visited on him/her."
As such, the Court agreed with the amicus curiae that there are inconsistencies and discrepancies in the accusation and the testimonies proffered before Court.
It also pulled up the prosecution for asking leading questions to the child which has been held as illegal and unfair to the accused, offending his right to a fair trial. The Court also recorded that the evidence from the medical examination also showed no proof of any penetrative assault. Further, it found that the testimonies in the instant case warranted further corroboration.
Therefore, it was concluded: 
"...in the teeth of the inconsistencies pointed out by us and the incident having been elicited by way of leading questions, we find it difficult to uphold the conviction as entered into by the trial court."
Accordingly, the conviction of the appellant was set aside and he was set at liberty.
Case Title: K Raghavan v. State of Kerala

The Kerala High Court on Thursday observed that film production units have the responsibility to form an Internal Complaints Committee as per the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 - commonly known as the POSH Act.

The Kerala High Court on Thursday observed that film production units have the responsibility to form an Internal Complaints Committee as per the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 - commonly known as the POSH Act.  
The Court further held that other related associations like the Film Employees Federation of Kerala(FEFKA), Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce. with more than 10 employees should have an ICC as mandated by the statute. Full copy of the judgment is yet to be uploaded.
The Court passed the order in the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) for establishment of grievance redressal mechanism in the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA), the body of Malayalam movie actors, as regards prevention of sexual harassment of women at workplaces.
A Division Bench of Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P. Chaly also recorded that AMMA has volunteered to constitute an ICC and added that if AMMA constitutes an ICC as undertaken the same shall be in accordance with the provisions of the POSH Act.
"so far as the film industry is concerned, the production unit is the workplace of an individual film and therefore, each production unit would have to constitute an Internal Complaints Committee, which alone can deal with the harassment against the women in contemplation of the provisions of Act, 2013."
The directions passed by the Court are as follows :
(1) The production unit of each film industry is an establishment employing Actor Artists and other workers and therefore, such production units have to maintain an Internal Complaints Committee, if they are engaging more than 10 workers, as is contemplated under the Act, 2013.
(2) Respondent organisations are duty bound to maintain Internal Complaints Committee, if they are engaging 10 workers or more for managing the office establishments and wherein women workers are employed for wages or not.
(3) If women workers are employed by any of the respondent organisations related to the film industry in which less than 10 workers are employed, then they are entitled to make suitable complaints to the Local Complaints Committee in accordance with the provisions contained under section 6 read with Section 9 of Act, 2013.
(4) Since the Association of Malayalam Movie Actors has volunteered to appoint a committee to deal with any sexual harassment at its workplace, we record the same and accordingly to take action to notify the members of the Internal Complaints Committee, in accordance with law.
Court appeals to film bodies to constitute a joint committee for redressal of women's complaints
"Even though, we have clearly expressed our views with respect to the extent of obligations of the organisations coming under the provisions of Act, 2013 to form Internal Committees, we convey our desire that the organisations associated with the film industry viz., Association of Malayalam Movie Actors (AMMA), FEFKA, Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce, Kerala Film Producers Association, take steps to constitute a joint committee, by including the members of organisations registered with them in tune with the provisions of Act, 2013 to deal with sexual harassment of women, which would definitely render sufficient confidence to women Actor Artists and other employees & other workers employed by the production unit ; which would in turn protect the dignity, and make the right to life and personal liberty of the women in the film industry more meaningful and fruitful".
Background
WCC was formed under the leadership of actors like Parvathy Thiruvothu, Revathy, Rima Killingal, Padmapriya, Anjali Menon etc., as an aftermath of the controversy following the sexual assault of a prominent actor in 2017, which was allegedly a part of the conspiracy hatched by actor Dileep. The trial in this case is still pending before a Special CBI Judge. 
It is the case of the petitioner that AMMA is trying to defend Dileep rather than protecting the survivor. In 2018, WCC had also convened a press meet, where they attacked the Association's inaction against Dileep and its indifference towards the interests of the survivor. Members of the WCC had further declared in the press meet that they will look for other means to redress their grievances as they had lost confidence in the leadership of AMMA. 
The main contention in the PIL was that the association had not constituted an Internal Complaints Committee/Grievance Redressal Cell as mandated by the Supreme Court in the Vishaka case and Sexual Harassment at Work Places (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2013.
Advocate Santhosh Mathew assisted by Advocates Anil Sebastian Pulickel, Arun Thomas, Vijay V. Paul, Karthika Maria and Veena Ravindran appearing for WCC argued that the Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce being a Society comprising of investors is bound by the provisions of the Vishaka judgment and the Act.
Therefore, they argued that it should have insisted that all Producers registering a particular Title constitute a Complaints Committee for the Project and ensure that prompt action is being taken to deal with any complaints received by the Complaints Committee constituted for the Project.
A similar argument was placed against the Kerala Film Producers Association, Film Employees Federation of Kerala (FEFKA), Malayalam Cinema Technicians Association (MACTA) and the Kerala Film Distributors Association. The petitioner asserted that these associations are legally obliged to consititute a Complaints Committee.
The plea had argued that the Association's omission violates its members' fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. Additionally, the nature of the work undertaken by the artists is such that they have no alternatives to seek similar redressal, the WCC pointed out. 
It has also been emphasised that the definition of 'workplace' in Section 2 (o) of the  Act includes any private sector organization or a private venture, undertaking, enterprise, institution, establishment, society etc, and that therefore, the Vishaka guidelines and 2013 Act are squarely applicable to the Association. 
Reliance was placed on the decision in Medha Kotwal Lele & Ors v. Union of India & Ors [(2013) 1 SCC 297] that reinstated the importance of implementing the guidelines laid down in the Vishaka judgment.

Case Title: Women in Cinema Collective & Anr v. State of Kerala & Ors. [WP(C) 34273/2018]

The Court said the the percentage of loss of earning capacity cannot be always equated with the percentage of permanent disability.The Supreme Court has held that the loss of earning capacity must be fixed as 100% when a claimant-motor accident victim is incapacitated for life and is confined to home.A person therefore is not only to be compensated for the injury suffered due to the accident but also for the loss suffered on account of the injury and his inability to lead the life he led, prior to the life...
The Supreme Court has held that the loss of earning capacity must be fixed as 100% when a claimant-motor accident victim is incapacitated for life and is confined to home.
A person therefore is not only to be compensated for the injury suffered due to the accident but also for the loss suffered on account of the injury and his inability to lead the life he led, prior to the life altering event  the bench of Justices R. Subhash Reddy and Hrishikesh Roy observed.  The court added that the extent of economic loss arising from a disability may not be measured in proportions to the extent of permanent disability.
"While the money awarded by Courts can hardly redress the actual sufferings of the injured victim (who is deprived of the normal amenities of life and suffers the unease of being a burden on others), the courts can make a genuine attempt to help restore the self-dignity of such claimant, by awarding 'just compensation' ", the bench remarked.
The court was considering the appeal filed by a person who suffered serious injuries from an accident. He was riding pillion in a bike when it was hit by a car. Both riders were impacted, resulting in severe head injuries to the appellant. He was bedridden, totally immobilized and initially, remained admitted in the hospital for 191 days. He has also suffered severe impairment of cognitive power with hemiparesis and total aphasia and the prognosis for him is 69%permanent disability.
In appeal, he submitted that he suffered 69% permanent disability and is unable to perform everyday activities and he requires constant support even for the confined life that he is leading. He also questioned the logic of the logic of restricting the compensation to 69% under the head of permanent disability when his  earning capacity is reduced to zero (notwithstanding his 69% permanent disability).
The bench observed that the Motor Vehicles Act is in the nature of social welfare legislation and its provisions make it clear that the compensation should be justly determined.
"While the permanent disability as certified by the doctors stands at 69%,the same by no means, adequately reflects the travails the impaired claimant will have to face all his life. The 21 year old's youthful dreams and future hopes were snuffed out by the serious accident. The young man's impaired condition has certainly impacted his family members. Their resources and strength are bound to be stressed by the need to provide full time care to the claimant. For the appellant to constantly rely on them for stimulation and support is destined to cause emotional, physical and financial fatigue for all stakeholders .", the court said.
The court noted that even though the physical disability is assessed at 69%, the functional disability is 100% in so far as claimant's loss of earning capacity is concerned.
12. The Courts should strive to provide a realistic recompense having regard to the realities of life, both in terms of assessment of the extent of disabilities and its impact including the income generating capacity of the claimant. In cases of similar nature, wherein the claimant is suffering severe cognitive dysfunction and restricted mobility, the Courts should be mindful of the fact that even though the physical disability is assessed at 69%, the functional disability is 100% in so far as claimant's loss of earning capacity is concerned.
The court therefore held that his loss of earning capacity must be fixed at 100%. An amount of Rs.27,67,800/- was directed to be given as compensation to him.
While allowing the appeal, the bench made the following
19. Before parting, it needs emphasizing that in cases such as this, the Tribunal and the Courts must be conscious of the fact that the permanent disability Page 17 of 20 suffered by the individual not only impairs his cognitive abilities and his physical facilities but there are multiple other non-quantifiable implications for the victim. The very fact that a healthy person turns into an invalid, being deprived of normal companionship, and incapable of leading a productive life, makes one suffer the loss of self-dignity. Such a Claimant must not be viewed as a modern day Oliver Twist, having to make entreaties as the boy in the orphanage in Charles Dickens's classic, "Please Sir, I want some more". The efforts must be to substantially ameliorate the misery of the claimant and recognize his actual needs by accounting for the ground realities. The measures should however be in correct proportion. As is aptly said by Justice R.V Raveendran, while speaking for the Division Bench in Sarla Verma and Others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Another , just compensation is adequate compensation and the Award must be just that- no less and no more. The plea 8 (2009)6 SCC 121 Page 18 of 20 of the victim suffering from a cruel twist of fate, when asking for some more, is not extravagant but is for seeking appropriate recompense to negotiate with the unforeseeable and the fortuitous twists is his impaired life. Therefore, while the money awarded by Courts can hardly redress the actual sufferings of the injured victim (who is deprived of the normal amenities of life and suffers the unease of being a burden on others), the courts can make a genuine attempt to help restore the self-dignity of such claimant, by awarding 'just compensation'.

 NCB submitted in their reply that Gurpreet Singh after being served with the notice under Section 67 of NDPS Act, 1985 had admitted the manner and factum of recovery. He further disclosed facts and manner of petitioner's active involvement in the conspiracy and smuggling of commercial quantity of Heroin from Pakistan to India.

The Calcutta High Court on Thursday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to not take any coercive measures against Trinamool Congress Birbhum district president Anubrata Mondal without the leave of the Court.

The Calcutta High Court on Thursday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to not take any coercive measures against Trinamool Congress Birbhum district president Anubrata Mondal without the leave of the Court. 
Mondal had moved the High Court seeking protection from arrest pursuant to the issuance of a CBI notice directing him to appear before its investigating team for the ongoing probe into the West Bengal post poll violence cases. He had been summoned by the CBI as a witness at the NIT camp office in Durgapur in neighbouring Paschim Bardhaman district at 11am on Thursday in connection with a murder case at Alambazar in Birbhum which is alleged to have a connection with the post-poll violence in West Bengal.
It may be noted that a 5 judge Bench of the High Court vide order dated August 19, 2021 had handed over to the CBI the investigation of the cases related to murder, rape and crime against women in connection with the violence in the State of West Bengal that had allegedly taken place in May 2021 soon after the declaration of the assembly election results. 
Justice Rajasekhar Mantha directed the petitioner to appear before the CBI at its Durgapur office and corporate with the ongoing investigation and further observed, 
In the event of any such fresh notice, the petitioner shall appear and cooperate in such investigation. However, no coercive measures shall be taken by the CBI against the petitioner without the leave of this Court.
While dictating the order, the Court further noted that the instant petition had become infructuous since the impugned notice issued by the CBI had directed the petitioner to appear on Thursday at 11am. However, it was observed that the notice issued under Section 160 CrPC by the CBI is still at large as such a notice has not been withdrawn by the CBI. 
Accordingly, Justice Mantha observed that the CBI is entitled to fix any other time for investigation and accordingly directed the CBI to issue notice afresh if necessary and call upon the petitioner for questioning at its Durgapur office. 
The Court rejected the contention of the CBI that the petitioner should have preferred an anticipatory bail application owing to the availability of alternative remedies. The Court underscored that jurisdiction of a writ Court under Article 226 of the Constitution cannot be ousted in so far as rights under Article 21 of the Constitution are involved and a prayer has been made of invasion of such rights. Reliance was placed on the Calcutta High Court judgment in Shyamali Adhikari v. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation in this regard. It was further held that it is a well settled law that each case must be looked at on its own facts and that ratio cannot be made de hors the facts. 
"The facts and circumstances of the instant case indicate that the petitioner apprehends infringement of rights under Article 21 of the Constitution", the Court noted further. The Court proceeded to further observe that protection under Article 226 of the Constitution is granted to even the worst offenders. Justice Mantha also took into consideration that the petitioner is not the principal accused in the FIR registered but is merely a witness. 
 Furthermore, the Court also dismissed the contention of the CBI that the territorial limitations as envisaged under Section 160 CrPC does not apply to a CBI investigation. 
"This Court is of the view that given the object and purpose of the Section 160 of the Cr.P.C. it must apply even to the investigations of the CBI. The fact that the CBI acts under its own manual and under the provisions of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act 1946 will not deprive a citizen of this Country, much less a person who not even the principal accused of the fairness and due process of law, which have been mandated and engraved into Section 160 of the CrPC", the Court underscored further. 
Submissions on behalf of the petitioner 
Advocate Sandipan Ganguly appearing for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner had been summoned to appear as a witness in a case registered by the CBI pertaining to the West Bengal post poll violence. The Court was apprised that the highest charge in the concerned case is that of murder under Section 302 of the IPC. The Court was also informed that notices had been issued to the petitioner by the CBI under Section 160 of the CrPC.
The first such notice had been issued on January 27, 2022 and thereafter, the petitioner had responded on January 28, 2022 stating that due to his various ailments, he will only be able to appear before the CBI after 8 weeks. Subsequently, without addressing the averments made by the petitioner in his reply, the CBI issued another notice seeking appearance on January 28, 2022 itself. 
The counsel argued that under Section 160 CrPC, the police officer issuing notice thereunder must be the person within whose territorial limits the noticee must reside. He argued that in the instant case, the petitioner is a resident of Bolpur which does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Durgapur Police Station or any other adjoining police station. Accordingly, the counsel submitted that the CBI should have directed the petitioner to appear at any office in Bolpur instead of in Durgapur. 
Arguing further, the counsel remarked, "Under the guise of calling me as a witness, I may be apprehended..it is a practice adopted by police authorities". He further submitted that the petitioner is willing to appear before the Durgapur in the event that the Court protects him from the apprehended arrest. 
Opposing the argument of the CBI that no reasonable case of apprehension of arrest has been made out, the counsel submitted that the conduct of the CBI to not even address the reply of the petitioner dated January 28, 2022 and instead issue another notice reflects such an apprehension. 
The Court was also apprised that the CBI had issued notices from an address in Lucknow and thus he remarked further in this regard, "They are coming to Durgapur from Lucknow, what prevents them from coming to Bolpur?"
Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court judgment in Vinod Dua v. Union of India and it was pointed out that the Supreme Court had granted protection from arrest against an issuance of notice under Section 160 CrPC by the CBI. 
Submissions on behalf of the CBI 
Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju appearing for the CBI argued that if the petitioner apprehends arrest, then he should be filing an anticipatory bail application. He emphasised that a writ petition cannot be a substitute for an anticipatory bail application. Thus, it was contended that the writ petition is hit by the principal of alternative remedy and thus should not be entertained. Reliance was placed on the Calcutta High Court judgement in Rakesh Singh v. State of West Bengal in this regard. 
He further submitted that since the counsel for the petitioner has already averred that the petitioner would be willingly to go to the concerned office in Durgapur if protection is given to him against any coercive action, thus he argued that the health grounds relied upon by the petitioner are a sham. It was also submitted that any apprehension of arrest has not been made out by the petitioner vide the averments made in the writ petition. 
"He has been issued notice under Section 160 CrPC, where is the apprehension of arrest?", ASG Raju further remarked. 
Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court judgments in Sushila Aggarwal v. State (Nct Of Delhi) and Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra and accordingly contended that an order granting protection against arrest cannot be issued if a reasonable case of arrest is not made out. 
Furthermore, the ASG argued that the petitioner does not come with clean hands before the Court. He submitted that the Court while passing orders under Section 482 CrPC or Article 226 of the Constitution, acts as a Court of Equity. He further referred to the reply filed by the petitioner to the notice issued by the CBI and accordingly argued that the response was a sham on the face of it. 
Referring to the contention of the petitioner that he suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the ASG further submitted that it is a chronic disease and not an acute disease. He argued that one can carry out regular activities with a chronic disease which is in other words a disease that one possesses for a lifetime.  It was thus reiterated that the health grounds relied upon by the petitioner to not appear before the CBI is thus a sham and is bogus in nature. 
The ASG also fervently argued that there is a difference between an investigation being conducted by the local police authorities and the CBI and thus submitted that territorial limitations as envisaged under Section 160 CrPC does not apply to a CBI investigation.

The Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has held that the State cannot be permitted to acquire private lands without paying full compensation to affected people for a very long period of time. While coming down heavily upon the lackadaisical behaviour of the State, a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Pankaj Mithal and Justice Sanjay Dhar observed,
 "It is an alarming situation that State is acquiring private land without payment of full compensation. This kind of action or omission on the part of the State authorities is not acceptable and cannot be allowed to continue for an indefinite period. We deprecate such practice and expect that the State would henceforth take all possible measures to ensure passing of an award within a reasonable time and payment of fair compensation to the persons interested where ever the land is acquired."
 Factual Background:
 The petitioners were residents of village Kanli Bagh, Baramulla in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir (erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir). They had invoked the writ jurisdiction of the Court for quashing the entire acquisition proceedings in respect of about 150 kanals and 03 marlas of the land which was notified for acquisition for the public purpose of establishing a Housing Colony at Sangri in Baramulla.
 In respect of the said acquisition, a final declaration under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act ("the Act") was issued on 27.05.1978. The Collector, Housing and Urban Development Department, Srinagar prepared a draft award on 15.10.1982, in terms of which a tentative award was issued on 17.03.1998 directing for payment of compensation @ ₹ 5,000/- per kanal with 15% Jabrana (solatium). Further, a simple interest @ 4% was directed to be paid from July 1978 to July 1985/1995, for the period of possession but no final award was pronounced as is mandatory under Section 11 of the Act for completing the acquisition proceedings.
 The petitioners had earlier approached the Court through a writ petition praying for a writ of mandamus to State for initiating acquisition proceedings afresh. In that case, no response was filed by the State. Therefore, the Court was constrained to decide the matter without having the version of the State. It directed the State to look into the grievances of the petitioners and to decide upon it, in accordance with law, within a period of two months. However, the State did not take any step as such. 
 The petitioners then instituted contempt proceedings. It was finally disposed of in view of the statement made by the counsel for the State that the consideration order would be passed on or before 09.02.2018. The consideration order was passed only on 15.03.2018. But again, no relief was granted to the petitioners. Hence, this petition was filed.
 Observations of the Court:
 The Court held that the possession of the land was taken over by the respondents and consequently, the villagers were divested of the land which came to be vested in the State. In the normal course, in view of Section 11B of the Act, the land acquisition proceedings would have lapsed for want of final award within two years of the date of declaration. However, here the urgency provisions were invoked and the possession of the land had been taken over on account of which the land was vested in the State. The land vested in the State cannot be divested and therefore, the proceedings for acquisition attained finality and would not lapse and permit de-notification of the acquisition proceedings. Under such circumstances, the respondents are left with no option but to make a final award as mandated by Section 11 of the Act. 
 It further observed,
 "…there is no dispute to the fact that the land stands acquired and that its possession has been taken over and handed over to the indenting department decades ago but till date final award has not been passed. The villagers as such have been deprived of the proper compensation of the acquired land which is clearly violative of the statutory provisions of the Land Acquisition Act and Article 300A of the Constitution of India. It rather amounts to denial of the basic human right to the villagers for almost about forty years."
 The Court stressed that right to possess and occupy land/property used to be a fundamental right and is still continuing to be a constitutional right. It has been recognized even as a basic human right. In view of Article 300-A of the Constitution of India, no person can be deprived of his property otherwise by following the due process of law. Therefore, the non-payment of the compensation as provided under the statutes amounts to depriving the person of his right to the property.
 The Court relied on Krishna Reddy v. Special Deputy Collector Land Acquisition, AIR 1988 SC 2123, wherein the Supreme Court while directing the statutory authorities to make the payment of compensation at the earliest observed that a person who has been uprooted may be facing starvation, therefore, the delayed payment may lose the charm and utility of compensation. Thus, the compensation must be determined and paid without loss of time.
 Accordingly, the Court issued the writ of mandamus, giving three months to the respondents to decide upon the final award. It further held that the petitioners would be entitled to and paid compensation according to the final award along with all statutory benefits including the interest within a period of one month of the pronouncement of the final award after adjusting the amount which had already been paid to them under the tentative award. Additionally, it imposed exemplary costs of Rupees 10 lakhs on the respondents for dragging the petitioners in unnecessary litigation for decades and for depriving them of their property without adequately compensating them for such a long period.

The Allahabad High Court recently granted bail to a dowry death accused (in jail for about 11 years) after it expressed its anguish over the poor progress of the trial in the case. 
The bench of Justice Shamim Ahmed was essentially dealing with the fourth bail application of one Fayanath Yadav booked in a criminal case registered against him under Sections 498-A, 304-B, I.P.C., and Section 3/4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.
The case in brief
Essentially, the Court was dealing with the fourth bail application of the accused wherein his counsel submitted that the applicant is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case. It was also submitted that the applicant has almost completed more than eleven years in incarceration, but to date the trial of this case has not been concluded.
Further, it was stated before the bench that the co-accused/mother of the applicant was granted bail by the High Court in September 2011, however, the applicant, who was arrested in June 2011, has not been granted bail despite the fact that he had already moved 3 bail pleas.
Lastly, it was also submitted that more than three years have been passed after the rejection of the third bail, but the trial of the case to date has not been concluded and as per information received, out of 18 prosecution witnesses only 06 prosecution witnesses have been examined till date.
Court's observations and order
After perusing the record in the light of the submissions made at the Bar and after taking an overall view of all the facts and circumstances of this case, at the very outset, the Court expresses its anguish towards the poor progress of the trial.
The Court said that the trial must have been concluded by now and the trial court was having powers to take coercive method to conclude the trial and also armed with the provisions of Section 309 Cr.P.C., therefore, the Court remarked that it was unable to comprehend as to how there was no good progress in the trial.
Against this backdrop, the Court granted him bail by observing thus:
"...(considering) the nature of evidence, the period of detention already undergone, the unlikelihood of early conclusion of trial and also the absence of any convincing material to indicate the possibility of tampering with the evidence, and considering that the applicant is in jail since 01.06.2011 and has completed more than 11 years in incarceration and the trial has not yet been concluded and out of 18 witnesses only 06 witnesses have been examined as per the counter affidavit filed by the State as well as considering the larger mandate of the Article 21 of the Constitution of India...this Court is of the view that the applicant may be enlarged on bail."
The Court, inter alia, relied upon Union of India vs. K.A. Najeeb AIR 2021 Supreme Court 712 and Paras Ram Vishnoi vs. The Director, Central Bureau of Investigation Criminal Appeal No.693 of 2021, wherein it was held by the Apex Court that if the accused person is in jail for a substantially long period and there is no possibility to conclude the trial in near future, the bail application may be considered.

The Supreme Court, in an order passed last month, criticized last moment filing of additional documents in Special Leave Petitions.
By not filing the application for additional documents at the time of filing the Special Leave Petition but filing the same at the last moment and on the previous day of the posting of the Special Leave Petition and many a time late in the evening causes great inconvenience to the Court, the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna observed.
The court noted that in many matters, Advocates-on- Record are filing the applications for additional documents only at the time of hearing of the Special Leave Petition(s) though the Special Leave Petitions are filed much earlier. 
"We impress upon all the learned Advocates-on- Record to take note of this order and ensure that whenever documents/ additional documents are to be relied upon are to be produced and as far as possible, they must be filed along with the Special Leave Petition. If for any reason the same have not been filed along with the Special Leave Petition then in that case the same shall be filed well in advance before the Special Leave Petitions are heard by the Courts. This will avoid inconvenience to the Court and Hon'ble Judges can have sufficient time to go through the same.", the bench said.
The bench observed thus in an order disposing a Special Leave Petition filed against an order passed by the Gauhati High Court. Senior Advocate Shyam Divan, who appeared for the petitioner relied upon some documents which were produced by way of additional documents, but those documents had not reached the bench. The Advocate-on-Record reported that these documents were e-filed two days back and due to paucity of time it might not have been circulated. In this context, the court said:
"Normally, all documents if any, which, according to the counsel for the petitioner, are relevant and/or material and which are part of the proceedings before the Court, shall have to be filed along with the Special Leave Petition itself particularly when reliance is placed on the said documents. Even additional documents which were not filed before the High Court on which the counsel for the petitioner proposes to rely, in that case also, a proper application is to be filed well in advance seeking permission to file additional documents which can be considered after considering Order 41 Rule 27 of the CPC when applicable. By not filing the application for additional documents at the time of filing the Special Leave Petition but filing the same at the last moment and on the previous day of the posting of the Special Leave Petition and many a time late in the evening causes great inconvenience to the Court. It is also found that, many a time, application for additional documents reach late in the night of the previous day of the hearing of the Special Leave Petition although those documents were part of the record of the impugned judgment and which should have been filed along with the Special Leave Petition."

The Delhi High Court has appointed retired Supreme Court judge, Justice Arjan Kumar Sikri, as Administrator to oversee utilization of funds in the upcoming ISSF Shooting World Cup, 2023.
ISSF World Cup (Rifle/Pistol) is scheduled to be held in Bhopal in March. 
A division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad observed that the country’s prestige will be affected if there is any impediment in organizing the World Cup event which would require funding from the Central Government. 
The court said that the Administrator can also take assistance of any sportsperson of his choice, who has been a national or an international shooter, to assist him in the matter. 
“The Administrator shall be free to fix his remuneration commensurate to the work and the same will be paid by the Union of India. The funds released must get the concurrence of the Administrator,” the court said. 
The bench sought a report to be furnished in a sealed cover after conclusion of the event.
The court was hearing an application moved by National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) seeking vacation or modification of the orders passed last year in a plea moved by Senior Advocate Rahul Mehra, against decisions taken by the Centre giving recognition to various National Sports Federations. 
The plea sought direction on the Central Government to grant recognition to National Sports Federations only after they comply with National Sports Code, 2011. 
On June 3 last year, a coordinate bench directed the Centre to ensure that monies, patronage and other facilities to National Sports Federations be resumed only when they comply with National Sports Code and various judicial orders.
NRAI in its application sought vacation or modification of the order stating that it has affected the smooth functioning of the National Sports Federations as the entire working capital has come to a standstill.
It was submitted that stoppage of funds would affect hosting of the World Cup and that the Association is dependent on the government for conduct of international events in the country, including training of the shooters and their participation in international events.
However, Mehra objected to the application stating that the Association ought not to have come to the court at the last minute and that granting any latitude would result in further applications being filed by other Sport Federations which are in violation of the Sports Code. 
However, he suggested an ad hoc solution that a committee comprising of a retired Judge and Abhinav Bindra, the first Olympic Gold Medal winner in Shooting, may be constituted to oversee the World Cup event. He also stated that the funds proposed to be released must be passed through the said Committee, which would then furnish its report in a sealed cover on conclusion of the event.
Calling the suggestion “a fair solution”, the bench noted that Mehra’s proposal was not opposed by the ASG and NRAI.
“In view of the above, Hon’ble Mr. Justice (Retd.) Arjan Kumar Sikri, Former Judge Supreme Court of India, is appointed as an Administrator to oversee the utilization of funds in the World Cup event that is being held in India in March, 2023,” the court said while disposing of the application. 
Title: RAHUL MEHRA v. UNION OF INDIA

The Gujarat High Court has quashed the detention order as there was a bonafide mistake in the selection of the wrong ODC vehicle type while generating the e-way bill.
The division bench of Justice J.B. Pardiwala (as then was) and Justice Nisha M. Thakore observed that the goods were in transit with all the necessary documents, including the E-way bill generated from the GST portal. The goods were moved by a truck whose registration number was also correct. The only mistake in this case was the selection of the wrong ODC vehicle type while generating the e-Way Bill.
 The writ applicant/assessee wrote an application to the State Tax Officer – 2, Mobile Squad, Amirgadh and made a request to release the goods, as, according to the writ applicant, in stating the vehicle type, inadvertently, it was shown as ODC.
 The issue raised was whether, in fact, it was a bona fide mistake on the part of the writ applicant or whether it was a mischievous act with a view to deriving some illegal benefit.
 The court has referred to the CBIC circular dated September 14, 2018 which says that in case a consignment of goods is accompanied with an invoice or any other specified document and also an e-way bill, proceedings under section 129 of the CGST Act may not be initiated, in the various situations.
 Firstly, proceedings shall not be initiated if there are spelling mistakes in the name of the consignor or the consignee but the GSTIN, wherever applicable, is correct.
 Secondly, proceedings shall not be initiated if there is an error in the PIN code but the address of the consignor and the consignee mentioned is correct, subject to the condition that the error in the PIN code should not have the effect of increasing the validity period of the e-way bill.
 Thirdly, proceedings shall not be initiated if there is an error in the address of the consignee to the extent that the locality and other details of the consignee are correct.
 Fourthly, proceedings shall not be initiated if there is an error in one or two digits of the document number mentioned in the e-way bill.
 Fifthly, proceedings shall not be initiated if there is an error in the 4 or digit level of HSN where the first 2 digits of HSN are correct and the rate of tax mentioned is correct.
 Lastly, proceedings shall not be initiated if there is an error in one or two digits or characters of the vehicle number.
 The court noted that the goods of the writ applicant fall within the circular. 
 "The manner in which the writ applicant has proceeded so far and also having regard to the fact that he brought to the notice of the authority concerned and admitted its mistake, we would like to give the writ applicant some benefit of doubt," the court added.
 The court has quashed the notice and order of detention passed by the department.

The Supreme Court observed that its power to punish for contempt is a constitutional power which cannot be abridged or taken away even by legislative enactment.
Motivated and calculated attempts to bring down the image of the judiciary in estimation of public and impair the administration of justice must bester themselves to uphold their dignity and the majesty of law, the Supreme Court observed in the order in which it held Suraz India Trust Chairman Rajiv Daiya guilty of contempt of court for scandalising the Court.
The court observed that the 'raison d'etre' of contempt jurisdiction is to maintain the dignity of the institution of judicial forums.
"It is not a vindictive exercise nor are inappropriate statements by themselves capable of lowering the dignity of a Judge. These are often ignored but where despite all latitude a perennial litigant seeks to justify his existence by throwing mud at all and sundry, the Court has to step in", the court added.
The court said that the easier path was to recuse or give up the matter instead of inviting so much trouble.
"But then that is not the course for which the Judges have taken oath. Sometimes the task is unenviable and difficult but it must be performed for the larger good of the institution. Such litigants cannot be permitted to have their way only because they can plead and write anything they feel like and keep on approbating by sometimes apologising and then again bringing forth those allegations. We have thus chosen the more difficult path.", it said.
Referring to the decision in Re: Roshan Lal Ahuja, the court observed:
"Disparaging remarks and aspersions deliberately and repeatedly made against the Supreme Court and its Judges in memorandum of writ petition and in representation made before the President of India in connection with order of reduction in rank and subsequent dismissal from service of the contemnor was held to bring down the image of judiciary in the estimation of public and to bring administration of justice into disrepute ."
The court also noticed the judgment in Re: Vijay Kurle & Ors and observed that here is no absolute licence when appearing in person to indulge in making aspersions as a tendency to scandalise the Court in relation to judicial matters.
"Motivated and calculated attempts to bring down the image of the judiciary in estimation of public and impair the administration of justice must bester themselves to uphold their dignity and the majesty of law. In the current context if seen, the grievance arises on account of the inability of the contemnor to file public interest petitions on account of costs being imposed, which he claims to be unable to pay and the consequences thereof of not being able to prosecute his petitions, which are large in number. The contemnor has apparently made a profession of filing public interest petitions of subjects of which he may not know much and then seeking to scandalise the Court to grant him relief failing which he will continue to scandalise the Court.", the court added.
Referring to Article 129 and 142 of the Constitution, the court observed:
"A bare reading of Article 129 clearly shows that this Court being a Court of Record shall have all the powers of such a Court of Record including the power to punish for contempt of itself. This is a constitutional power which cannot be taken away or in any manner abridged by statute... In the context of the aforesaid it was opined that the comparison of the two provisions show that whereas the founding fathers felt that the powers under clause (2) of Article 142 could be subject to any law made by the Parliament, there is no such restriction as far as Article 129 is concerned. The power to punish for contempt is a constitutional power vested in this Court which cannot be abridged or taken away even by legislative enactment."
Holding that the contemnor is guilty of contempt, the court observed:
"We have little doubt that what the contemnor has been endeavouring is to have his way or, alternatively, I will throw mud at all and sundry, whether it be the Court, its administrative staff or the State Government so that people, apprehensive of this mud thrown, may back off.  We refuse to back off and are clear in our view that we must take it to its logical conclusion.. We are of the view that the contemnor is clearly guilty of contempt of this Court. His actions to scandalise the Court cannot be countenanced. He continues with his contumacious behaviour. The apologies submitted by him are only endeavours to get out of the consequences again followed by another set of allegations, thus, a charade. The last apology can hardly be called an apology seeing the contents. This Court has held that an apology cannot be a defence, a justification can be accepted if it can be ignored without compromising the dignity of the Court."

The Supreme Court has observed that while a person can resign at any time during his service, he can ask for voluntary retirement only if he meets the eligibility criteria."A person can resign at any time during his service, however, an officer cannot ask for premature/voluntary retirement unless he fulfils the eligibility criteria", a bench comprising Justices MR...
The Supreme Court has observed that while a person can resign at any time during his service, he can ask for voluntary retirement only if he meets the eligibility criteria.
"A person can resign at any time during his service, however, an officer cannot ask for premature/voluntary retirement unless he fulfils the eligibility criteria", a bench comprising Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna observed in the judgment in the case Union of India and another v. Abhiram Verma.
The case related to eligibility of an officer in the Indian Army(Armed Medical Corps), who had resigned after nearly 8 years of service, for pensionary benefits. The Armed Forces Tribunal had held him entitled to pensionary benefits, and this was approved by the Jammu and Kashmir High Court as well. Challenging these verdicts, the Union of India approached the Supreme Court.
According to the AFT and the High Court, what the officer had submitted was not "resignation" but an application for "voluntary retirement". It was held that the officer was entitled to  terminal/pensionary benefits taking qualifying service as 15 years as a "late entrant" under Regulation 15 of the Pension Regulations.
The Supreme Court disagreed with the findings of both the AFT and the High Court. The Court noted that the the qualifying service for the purpose of "voluntary retirement" is minimum 10 years' service, which the officer did not have. Also, in his previous correspondences, he had mentioned that he was submitting resignation for lack of promotional opportunities.
Even, there is a distinction between the "resignation" and "voluntary retirement". A person can resign at any time during his service, however, an officer cannot ask for premature/voluntaryretirement unless he fulfils the eligibility criteria. 
The judgment referred to the precedents Senior Divisional Manager, LIC v Shree Lal Meena(2019) and BSES Yamuna Power Ltd. vs.Ghanshyam Chand Sharma(2020) which had discussed the differences between "resignation" and "voluntary retirement".
"When the legislature, in its wisdom, brings forth certain beneficial provisions in the form of Pension Regulations from a particular date and on particular terms and conditions, aspects which are excluded cannot be included in it by implication. Therefore, having tendered the "resignation", the respondent has to suffer the consequences and now cannot be permitted to take 'U' turn and say that what the respondent wanted was "premature retirement" and not "resignation"", the judgment authored by Justice Shah observed.
The Court also noted that the minimum qualifying service for pension as per the Pension Regulations is 20 years.
Also, the Court held that the officer cannot be treated as a "late entrant" in terms of Regulation 15.
As per Regulation 15, a "late entrant" is an officer who is retired on reaching the prescribed age limit for compulsory retirement with at least 15 years commissioned service (actual). As the respondent did not retire on reaching the prescribed age limit for compulsory retirement, the respondent cannot be said to be a "late entrant". 
Allowing the appeal of the Union, the Court set aside the judgments of the AFT and the HC.

Observing that "the marriage is totally dead" and that nothing would be gained by trying to keep the parties tied forever to a marriage that in fact has ceased to exist, the Karnataka High Court recently granted divorce to a couple who lived separately for a period of 21 years.
 A division bench of Justice B Veerapa and Justice K S Hemalekha said,
"Once the parties have separated and the separation has continued for a sufficient length of time of more than 21 years and one of them presented a petition for divorce, it can well be presumed that the marriage has broken down."
 It added, "The Court, no doubt, should seriously make an endeavour to reconcile the parties; yet, if it is found that the breakdown is irreparable, then divorce should not be withheld. The consequences of preservation in law of the unworkable marriage which has long ceased to be effective are bound to be a source of greater misery for the parties."
 Case Background:
 The couple who is 56-years old had married in the year 1999. The husband claimed that the same year the wife withdrew herself from his company and went to her parent's home. Even after several requests made by him and other family members she has not returned home. Therefore in the year 2003 he filed a petition under section 13 (1) (1b) of the Hindu Marriage Act, seeking divorce on the ground of desertion.
 The family court passed an ex-parte order granting divorce in 2004 and following which the husband married the second time and has two children. The wife challenged the same before the high court which allowed the petition for divorce came to be restored before the family court. In 2012, the petition filed by the husband seeking divorce was dismissed. This order came to be challenged before the high court by the husband.
 Husband's Submissions:
 The husband's counsel claimed that the judgement and decree passed by the trial court is erroneous and contrary to the material on record. Appellant has got married a second time after the ex-parte decree and there is no possibility of the reconciliation of the marriage. It is irretrievably broken and they are residing separately for a period of 21-years.
 Wife opposed the plea:
 It was said the appellant was insisting on her to bring further dowry from her parents and she was not prepared to give further dowry since at the time of her marriage, golden ornaments and cash were already given to the appellant and all the marriage expenses were met by her parents.
 The appellant with an intention to have a second marriage was forcing her to give consent for divorce and had also sent many people to her house to pressurize her to give consent. Since she and her parents did not agree to give consent for divorce, the appellant developed ill-will towards her and started to trouble her. The appellant never provided food and basic necessities of life and she was made to starve.
 Court findings:
 Considering that several reconciliation attempts had failed, the court said, "Taking into consideration the fact that the parties are aged 56 years and are residing separately for more than 21 years, though this Court tried to persuade the parties for settlement, the same could not be fructified." 
 It added, "The appellant/ husband has already got married for the second time after an ex-parte decree of divorce passed by the Family Court and is having two children out of the said wedlock. The respondent/wife has not filed any petition for restitution of conjugal rights. There is no possibility of reconciliation. Therefore, we are of the considered view that there is no scope for settlement between the parties and there is no chance of parties living together and the marriage has irretrievably broken down. Therefore, it is a fit case to grant a decree of divorce."
 Considering that the wife has filed civil proceedings to restrain the husband from a second marriage until she is alive, the court observed that the respondent/wife neither wants divorce nor permanent alimony. 
From the analysis and evaluation of entire material on record, it is clear that the respondent/wife has resolved to live in agony and make life miserable and hell, not only for herself but also to the appellant as well. This kind of adamant and callous attitude, in the facts and circumstances of the case leaves no doubt in our mind that the respondent is bent upon to treat the appellant with mental cruelty.
 It observed, "It is abundantly clear that the marriage between the parties has broken down irretrievably and there is no chance of their reunion. Undoubtedly, it is the obligation on the Court and all concerned that the marriage status should, as far as possible, as long as possible and whenever possible, be maintained, but when the marriage is totally dead, in that event, nothing is gained by trying to keep the parties tied forever to a marriage which in fact has ceased to exist."
 Interfering with the family court order, the bench said, "The course which has been adopted by the Family Court would encourage continuous bickering, perpetual bitterness and may lead to immorality. Therefore, we are of the considered opinion that it is a fit case to grant a decree of divorce."
 Accordingly, it set aside the trial court order and granted divorce to the couple. It directed the husband to pay permanent alimony 30 lakhs to the respondent/wife, within a period of four months.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High has reiterated that an ad hoc employee cannot be replaced by another ad hoc employee; such position can be filled only by a candidate who is regularly appointed by following a regular procedure prescribed.
 The observations were made by Justice Sanjay Dhar while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had challenged an Advertisement Notice whereby respondents had invited applications for temporary engagement of Staff Nurses on academic arrangement basis initially for a period of six months. The petitioner also sought a direction upon the respondents to allow them to continue on the posts of Staff Nurses till such time these posts are filled up on substantive basis.
 The petitioners premised their challenge to the impugned advertisement on the ground that it was impermissible in law for the respondents to replace the temporary arrangement of engagement of petitioners with a similar arrangement. Even though their appointment is purely of temporary and contractual in nature, yet the respondents cannot replace them by a similar arrangement, the petitioners submitted before the bench.
 Perusal of the record revealed that the petitioners had responded to an earlier Advertisement issued by the State authority, whereby applications were invited for engagement on academic arrangement basis for the posts of Staff Nurses for a period of six months or till such time the posts are filled up on substantive basis.
 Record further revealed that the petitioners participated in the selection process and were engaged as Staff Nurses in terms of a Government Order.
 The court took note of the fact that after the expiry of the initial period of their engagement, extension was given by the State authority for continuation of their services from time to time and last of such extensions was granted till ending of November, 2022. In the meanwhile, respondents issued the impugned Advertisement Notice, which was being impugned by the petitioners in the instant petition.
 Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Dhar observed that an ad hoc employee cannot be replaced by another ad hoc employee and he can be replaced only by another candidate who is regularly appointed by following a regular procedure prescribed.
 In order to fortify the stand the bench placed reliance on Ratan Lal and Ors v. State of Haryana 1985 where Supreme Court had deprecated the policy of the State Government to appoint teachers on ad hoc basis and terminate their services and then appoint them again on ad hoc basis.
 The bench observed that perusal of the impugned Advertisement Notice clearly suggests that the respondents intend to make engagement against the vacant posts of staff Nurses Grade II on academic arrangement basis initially for a period of six months.
 "Admittedly, the Advertisement Notice is not for filling up of these posts on substantive basis. The petitioners are also working on the posts of Staff Nurses Grade II on academic arrangement which is contractual in nature. Thus the respondents intend to replace the contractual arrangement of the petitioners with a similar arrangement...Such course of action, in the face of the law laid down by the Supreme Court, is not permissible", the bench said.
 Expounding further on the matter Justice Dhar recorded,
 "It may be correct to say that the petitioners are not entitled to seek extension of their contractual engagement but at the same time the respondents' action of replacing the academic arrangement by another similar arrangement cannot be countenanced in law. The respondents can only replace the petitioners by filling up the vacant posts of Staff Nurses on substantive basis, which they have not chosen to do".
 For the foregoing reasons the bench allowed the petition and quashed the advertisement notice.

The Delhi High Court has modified the conviction and sentence of a man from sec. 397 of Indian Penal Code to sec. 392 as the prosecution had failed to prove the use of a deadly weapon. 
Justice Mukta Gupta was of the view that the prosecution is required to prove the nature of the weapon of offence used specially in the case of knife or blade.
"In the absence of the use of a deadly weapon being proved by the prosecution, the conviction of the appellant for offence punishable under Section 397 IPC cannot be sustained and is required to be modified to an offence punishable under Section 392 IPC," the Court said. 
The Court also perused the nominal roll of the appellant which showed that he had undergone approximately 3 years and 9 months of sentence including remissions and that he was involved in four other FIRs including three FIRs relating to similar offences.
"Consequently, the conviction of the appellant is altered to for an offence punishable under Section 392 IPC and the sentence of the appellant is modified to rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years," the Court said. 
The Court was dealing with a plea filed by one Asif challenging the judgment dated 5th July, 2019 convicting him for offence punishable under sec. 397 IPC and the order on sentence dated 17th July, 2019 directing him to undergo sentence of seven years imprisonment.
The FIR was registered under sec. 392, 397 and 34 of IPC on the statement of the complainant who stated that on 9th January, 2015 the appellant and a co-accused had committed robbery of his mobile phone from his possession by showing him a deadly weapon, that is the blade.
The counsel for appellant had pointed out glaring contradictions in the testimonies of three prosecution witnesses who gave different versions in respect of the manner of commission of alleged robbery and the investigation carried out by the police qua the three witnesses.
Perusing the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, the Court said that it is trite law that even if the weapon of offence is shown after snatching had taken place for running away along with snatched article, offence under sec. 397 IPC is attracted. 
It also noted that a theft is 'robbery' if, in order to committing of the theft or in committing the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by theft, the offender, for that end, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint. 
"Thus, if the offender uses the deadly weapon at the time of committing robbery or dacoity which would include even the fear of instant death or instant hurt or wrongful restrain or an attempt to cause death or hurt or wrongful restraint even while carrying away or attempting to carry away the property obtained by theft, the act of the offender will fall within the four corners of Section 397 IPC," the Court said. 
The Court therefore rejected the contention of counsel for the appellant that sec. 397 IPC is not made out as the blade was allegedly shown after the mobile phone was robbed. 
"The decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant did not consider the necessary ingredients of an offence of robbery which in turn is a necessary ingredient of an offence punishable under Section 397 IPC," it noted. 
Further noting that a pistol, revolver, sword, axe or even a knife are deadly weapons, the Court said that in the case of knife, the length of the knife, its sharpness and the pointed edge has to be seen to ascertain whether the knife is a deadly weapon or not.
In the facts of the case, the Court took note of the fact that while the evidence of the prosecution was that the appellant took out a blade and kicked the complainant, in cross-examination it was stated that the blade was not a shaving blade. Therefore, the Court said that the kind of blade used was not proved even by the ocular evidence of the witnesses. 
"Though it is not essential that the weapon of offence should be recovered to prove the nature of the weapon used and that a deadly weapon was used at the time of commission of the offence, however, the prosecution is required to prove the nature of the weapon of offence used specially in the case of knife or blade. Since from the evidence of the prosecution witnesses the size and sharpness of the blade is not proved, hence the prosecution has failed to prove that the appellant used a deadly weapon," the Court added. 
With the aforesaid observations, the plea was disposed of.

The Allahabad High Court recently deplored the behavior of an Advocate (Counsel appearing for the petitioner), who, despite being present within the Court premises, sent his illness slip before the Court seeking adjournment in a matter. Noting the circumstances under which the illness slip was sent, the Bench of Justice Jaspreet Singh called him before the Court and a specific query was put to him as to whether he was appearing in the matter before the Court. In response to this, he submitted that he does appear in the matter and added that though he had come to the Court, since he was having a headache, therefore, he had sent an illness slip. Noting this response of the Counsel, the Court remarked thus:
 "This act of Sri Chandra Has Mishra (the advocate) is deprecated and it is absolutely unacceptable that once a counsel is present in the Court he ought not to have sent an illness slip, such practice cannot be accepted." If at all the counsel for the petitioner was not well, the Court further added, he could himself had stood up and informed the Court rather to have sent an illness slip in the morning and remain in the Court premises throughout the day. Even the counsel for the respondent raised an objection to this act of the Counsel for the petitioner
 The Court, in its order, noted that the Counsel remained unapologetic and made submissions to justify his conduct which is not acceptable to the Court. However, the Court did adjourn the matter as the Counsel was reluctant to argue and made it clear that no further adjournment shall be granted to either of the parties. 
In a significant observation, the Rajasthan High Court (Jodhpur Bench) has held that as per Section 2(a) of the Domestic Violence Act of 2005, the definition of 'aggrieved person', would include any woman including a foreign citizen, who is subjected to domestic violence.Such a woman is very much entitled to get the protection of Section 12 of the Act of 2005 [Application to Magistrate],...
In a significant observation, the Rajasthan High Court (Jodhpur Bench) has held that as per Section 2(a) of the Domestic Violence Act of 2005, the definition of 'aggrieved person', would include any woman including a foreign citizen, who is subjected to domestic violence.
Such a woman is very much entitled to get the protection of Section 12 of the Act of 2005 [Application to Magistrate], the Court further ruled.
Significantly, the Bench of Justice Vinit Kumar Mathur also observed that a plain reading of the Domestic Violence Act reveals that protection under the Act is extended to the persons who are temporarily resident of India, being covered under the definition of aggrieved person as per section 2 (a) of the Act of 2005.
The case before the Court
One Catherine Nieiddu, a Canadian citizen filed a complaint against her husband, Robarto Nieddu (petitioner before the Court) under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act.
The petitioner preferred an application against the complaint of her wife, on the ground of maintainability of the complaint as being non-maintainable. The same was dismissed by the trial court vide order dated February 11, 2021. 
The order was assailed by the petitioner by way of filing an appeal before the appellate court, and the same was also rejected by the appellate court vide order dated August 5, 2021. 
Aggrieved against both the orders, the instant petition was moved before the High Court.
Before the Court, it was submitted by the petitioner that the complaint of respondent No.2 i.e. before the trial court under Section 12 of the Act of 2005 was not maintainable as the petitioner and respondent No.2 are not Indian citizens and thus, are not amenable to the jurisdiction of the Act of 2005.
Lastly, he submitted that since the petitioner was only a resident of India at that relevant point of time will not confer jurisdiction in the instant case.
Court's order
Observing that a woman of foreign origin can maintain an application under Section 12 of the Domestic Violence as such a woman would come under the purview of the definition of 'aggrieved person' as per Section 2 (a) of the Act, the Court, at the outset, observed thus:
"The fact that the respondent No.2 (woman) is resident of Jodhpur for last about 25 years and after having solemnized marriage with the petitioner, the incident which is reported in the complaint also took place at Jodhpur and therefore, in view of definitions enumerated under sections 2 (a) and 12 of the Act of 2005, it is held that the application preferred by the respondent No.2 before the trial court is maintainable"
Importantly, referring to Article 21 of the Constitution of India, the Court remarked that even Article 21 of the Constitution of India extends the benefit of protection not only to every citizen of the country, but also to a "person" who may not be a citizen of the Country. 
"Article 21 states that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to a procedure established by law. Therefore, looked at from that angle, a person aggrieved i.e. respondent No.2 is very much entitled to get protection of section 12 of the Act of 2005," the Court noted as it dismissed the petition.

Read Order

The Allahabad High Court last week denied anticipatory bail to a man accused of luring 90 Hindus to convert to Christianity by putting them under undue influence, coercion by playing fraud, and promise of easy money, etc.
 Stressing that anticipatory bail is an extraordinary remedy to be exercised in suitable cases only, the bench of Justice Jyotsna Sharma denied the relief as it did not find any good ground to grant anticipatory bail to the accused.
 The bench was essentially dealing with the anticipatory bail plea of one Bhanu Pratap Singh, booked under sections 153A, 506, 420, 467, 468, 471 I.P.C. and sections- 3/5(1) of Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020.
 The case in brief
 As per the prosecution case, an F.I.R. was lodged with the allegations that about 90 persons of Hindu religion have been congregated at a Church in Fatehpur for the purpose of their conversion to Christianity.
 On receiving the information, the Government officers raided the plea and interrogated the pastor Vijay Massiah, who disclosed that the process for conversion was going on for the last 34 days and that this process shall be completed within 40 days.
 Allegedly, the pastor also informed that they have been trying to convert even patients admitted to the Mission Hospital and the employees play an active role in the same.
 The Government officers found 35 persons including the accused/applicant (named in the F.I.R.) and 20 unknown persons as having been involved in this conversion.
 The accused moved the High Court arguing that he was not involved in the act and in fact, he was not present at the spot and that he has been falsely implicated in this case for ulterior motives.
 It was further contended that some of the persons named in the F.I.R. viz. Madhuri Panna and Vijay Kumar Samson have been granted anticipatory bail. Hence, on the basis of parity, his application for anticipatory bail deserves to be allowed.
 On the other hand, the counsel for the state contended that there was a bigger conspiracy hatched by the applicant and his associates with wider ramifications; they were acting in an organized manner for mass conversion.
 It was further submitted that this is not a case where an individual was driven by his conscience to convert to a different faith but the accused persons in tandem with each other systematically went on to influence the persons who usually came in their contact for the purpose medical treatment or otherwise and their poor socio-economic condition was exploited to lure them into participating in mass conversion. 
 Against this backdrop, taking into account the testimonies of the eye-witnesses, and public witnesses, supporting the prosecution’s case, the Court did not find it to be a fit case to extend the relief of anticipatory bail. 
 Consequently, the anticipatory bail plea was rejected.

The Supreme Court observed that compensation for future prospects can be claimed in accident cases involving serious injuries resulting in permanent disablement.
The bench said that it has come across the opposite view taken by High Courts and Motor Accident Claims Tribunals. Such a narrow reading is illogical because it denies altogether the possibility of the living victim progressing further in life in accident cases – and admits such possibility of future prospects, in case of the victim's death, the court said.
The bench observed thus while enhancing compensation awarded to an accident victim who had suffered permanent disability to the extent of 45%. Recalculating the compensation, the bench enhanced the compensation from Rs.9,26,800/- awarded by the High Court to Rs.21,78,600/-.
In its judgment, the bench discussed the position of law regarding determining the compensation in accident cases. The principle followed in assessing motor vehicle compensation claims, is to place the victim in as near a position as she or he was in before the accident, with other compensatory directions for loss of amenities and other payments, the court noted.
The court made the following observations in the judgment:
'Future Prospects'
"It is now a well settled position of law that even in cases of permanent disablement incurred as a result of a motor-accident, the claimant can seek, apart from compensation for future loss of income, amounts for future prospects as well. We have come across many orders of different tribunals and unfortunately affirmed by different High Courts, taking the view that the claimant is not entitled to compensation for future prospects in accident cases involving serious injuries resulting in permanent disablement. That is not a correct position of law. There is no justification to exclude the possibility of compensation for future prospects in accident cases involving serious injuries resulting in permanent disablement. Such a narrow reading is illogical because it denies altogether the possibility of the living victim progressing further in life in accident cases – and admits such possibility of future prospects, in case of the victim's death."
'Just Compensation'
"just compensation" should include all elements that would go to place the victim in as near a position as she or he was in, before the occurrence of the accident. Whilst no amount of money or other material compensation can erase the trauma, pain and suffering that a victim undergoes after a serious accident, (or replace the loss of a loved one), monetary compensation is the manner known to law, whereby society assures some measure of restitution to those who survive, and the victims who have to face their lives.
Serious injury inflicts deep mental and emotional scars upon the victim
Courts should be mindful that a serious injury not only permanently imposes physical limitations and disabilities but too often inflicts deep mental and emotional scars upon the victim. The attendant trauma of the victim's having to live in a world entirely different from the one she or he is born into, as an invalid, and with degrees of dependence on others, robbed of complete personal choice or autonomy, should forever be in the judge's mind, whenever tasked to adjudge compensation claims. Severe limitations inflicted due to such injuries undermine the dignity (which is now recognized as an intrinsic component of the right to life under Article 21) of the individual, thus depriving the person of the essence of the right to a wholesome life which she or he had lived, hitherto. From the world of the able bodied, the victim is thrust into the world of the disabled, itself most discomfiting and unsettling. If courts nit-pick and award niggardly amounts oblivious of these circumstances, there is resultant affront to the injured victim.

Motor Accident Compensation Claims - Even in cases of permanent disablement incurred as a result of a motor-accident, the claimant can seek, apart from compensation for future loss of income, amounts for future prospects as well - Law regarding determination of compensation discussed - "Just compensation" should include all elements that would go to place the victim in as near a position as she or he was in, before the occurrence of the accident - Courts should be mindful that a serious injury not only permanently imposes physical limitations and disabilities but too often inflicts deep mental and emotional scars upon the victim. (Para 29-32, 139)
Motor Accident Compensation Claims - Notional Income - It is not necessary to adduce any documentary evidence to prove the notional income of the victim and the Court can award the same even in the absence of any documentary evidence - The Court should ensure while choosing the method and fixing the notional income that the same is just in the facts and circumstances of the particular case, neither assessing the compensation too conservatively, nor too liberally - Referred to Kirti and Another v. Oriental Insurance Company Limited, (2021) 2 SCC 166. (Para 59)
Motor Accident Compensation Claims - Pecuniary Expenses and Non- Pecuniary Loss - "Future Medical Expenses" and "Attendant Charges" would fall within the ambit of Pecuniary Expenses - "Pain and suffering" would be categorized as a non-pecuniary loss as it is incapable of being arithmetically calculated. Therefore, when compensation is to be awarded for pain and suffering, special circumstances of the claimant have to be taken into account including the victim's age, the unusual deprivation the victim has suffered, the effect thereof on his or her future life. (Para 67, 93)

The Supreme Court has once again stressed on the need to immediately deliver judgments by observing that a litigant cannot be expected to wait indefinitely for availability of the reasons for a Court Order.
In this case, a party to election petition filed an an application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in the High Court for Telangana. An order was pronounced on 15.06.2022, purportedly allowing the application and and rejecting the election petition.
Before the Apex Court bench, the appellant submitted that the reasoned order allowing the application is not available as yet. The court noticed that the reasons for the order are not available with either of the parties nor are available on the website of the High Court nor the copy of the order has been supplied despite the parties having made the applications seeking certified copy of the order.
"The position obtaining at present is that even after more than three months from pronouncement of the order by the High Court, the reasons are not forthcoming and are not available with either of the parties. Looking to the nature of litigation and the overall circumstances, we find it difficult to countenance this position.", the bench observed.
The court, referring to the decisions in Anil Rai v. State of Bihar (2001) 7 SCC 318 and State of Punjab and Others v. Jagdev Singh Talwandi (1984) 1 SCC 596, observed: 
"We are of the view that the guidelines and observations therein remain fundamental to the course of dispensation of justice in any cause before the Court and the principle set out therein need to be applied with necessary variation, as may be necessary in the given fact situation of any particular case."
Allowing the appeal, the court set aside the impugned order  restored the matter for re-consideration.
Senior Advocate Dr. A.M. Singhvi assisted by Advocate Anand Padmanabhan appeared for the appellant.

The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday permanently injuncted four advertisements by the makers of Baidyanath Chyawanprash Special for being disparaging to all other brands of Chyawanprash including Dabur Chyawanprash.

The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday permanently injuncted four advertisements by the makers of Baidyanath Chyawanprash Special for being disparaging to all other brands of Chyawanprash including Dabur Chyawanprash. 
Justice Shekhar B Saraf was adjudicating upon a plea moved by Dabur seeking an injunction against the uploading of five advertisements that had allegedly disparaged the goodwill and reputation of its trademark.
Partially allowing the appeal, the Court stated that the concerned advertisement facilities a false statement that denigrates all other brands of Chyawanprash. The Court observed further, 
"Precedents cited by both parties make it clear that true statements can be made even if it denigrates the rival's product, but false and misleading statements cannot be allowed under the guise of free speech. In light of the same, this video advertisement is disparaging and an action from this Court would lie. In light of the reasons provided above, this video advertisement is permanently injuncted."
The Court further underscored that the concerned advertisements are misleading and accordingly opined, 
"A misleading advertising, as the term implies, is one that deceives, manipulates, or is likely to deceive or manipulate the consumer. These commercials have the potential to influence consumer's purchase preference in the market and it also harms its rivals, hence, they must be used with caution. There should be a balance between the right of commercial speech and the interest of public and competitors. In the present case, the video advertisement is, to a large extent, misleading"
Arguments 
Dabur had sought the taking down of advertisements by Baidyanath by contending that the advertisements are comparative in nature and made untruthful comparisons. It was further argued that although there had been no direct reference to Dabur, however, there had been generic disparagement, giving rise to the instant cause of action.
In the impugned advertisement, Baidyanath had published a comparative chart describing the qualities of its product with other rival products in the market.  It was further claimed that its Chyawanprash has '52 herbs' whereas its rivals have only '42 ingredients'. 
On the other hand, the counsel for Baidyanath argued that the right to commercial speech was a part of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution. Accordingly, it was contended that any curtailment of advertisements would would violate its fundamental right. The Court was also apprised that the impugned advertisements do not refer to Dabur's product at all, but an unnamed fictitious product.
Observations 
The Court referred to a host of judgments and accordingly observed that while deciding the issue of disparagement the Court has to apply the reasonable man test, that is, whether a reasonable man would take the claim being made as being a serious claim or not.
It was further opined that the impugned advertisement campaign has to be looked into with a broader perspective to decide whether a serious comparison is made by the alleged infringer.
"The comparison in the nature of "Better or Best" based on truthful claims is permitted, but comparison in the nature of "Good v. Bad" is not. The impact and impression of the impugned advertisements has to be examined and if it gives out an impression that the rival product has a defect or demerit (which is not true) then such impression would make it disparaging", the Court elucidated further. 
It was further stated that the comparison between rival products is allowed only to the extent of "Puff" and honest trade practice. Any malicious or deliberate depiction of rival product in a bad taste is not permitted, the Court underscored further. 
"Generic disparagement of a rival product without specifically identifying or pin pointing the rival product is equally objectionable, clever advertising can indeed hit a rival product without specifically referring to it. No one can disparage a class or genre of a product within which a complaining plaintiff falls and raise a defence that the plaintiff has not been specifically identified", the Court held further. 
Arguing further that comparative advertising campaign should be 'comparison positive', the Court held that if the advertisements contain valuable information for the consumers and can promote healthy competition in the market, the Courts should be resilient and allow the negative derivatives of such comparison.
Reliance was also placed on the Calcutta High Court judgment in Hindustan Unilever Ltd v. Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd  to observe, 
"The above case squarely applies to the present dispute because the comparison made by the defendant/respondent is specifically pointing towards deficiency of the other rival products including the petitioner's product. Moreover, the claim made by the defendant/respondent with regard to number of ingredients of the rival product is false and misleading."
It was emphasised that the comparison in the impugned advertisement fell under the ambit of "negative comparison" since they portrayed Dabur Chyawanprash as inferior or lacking in ten more ingredients that are allegedly essential for it to be complete, and was thus not protected as commercial speech.
"When the defendant highlights that other Chyawanprash contain only 42 ingredients, which is an untrue statement, it cannot claim right to free speech as the same is not allowed to communicate untruthful facts about the other rival products," the Court underscored.
Accordingly, the Court held that the advertisements apart from one that did not mention the number of ingredients were disparaging. The Court however made suggestions for the modification of other injuncted advertisements other than one by removing the reference to "42 ingredients". The order thus stated, 
"a) The bottle that is shown in the 6th second of the advertisement shall only have the printed words "CHYAWANPRASH" and no other word;
b) The reference to the words "42 nahi" in the 29th to 31st second of advertisement shall also be removed."
Senior Advocate Sudipta Sarkar and Advocates Jawahar Lal, Debnath Ghosh, Anuj Garg, Sudhakar Prasad and Pradipta Bose appeared for Dabur. Baidyanath was represented by Advocates Manish Biala, Amrita Panja Moulick, Ashutosh Upadhaya and Devesh Ratan.

Overruling a 49-year-old judgment that effectively barred Muslim women from resorting to extra judicial modes of dissolving marriage, the High Court has upheld the validity of these modes.
 Finding that the governing law, The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act did not contemplate the undoing of the modes of extra-judicial divorce available to women under personal law, the bench of Justices A Muhamed Mustaque and CS Dias held,
 "All other forms of extra-judicial divorce as referred in Section 2 of the Shariat Act are thus available to a Muslim women. We, therefore, hold that the law declared in K.C.Moyin's case (supra) is not good law."
 The Court's judgment comes in the context of a clutch of petitions filed before it by aggrieved partners in marriages where extra-judicial modes of dissolution had been resorted to.
"The issue involved in as above is inextricably connected to ultimate justice which women involved in all these cases seek. These cases speak in abundance about the patriarchal mind-set followed in the Society for decades depriving Muslim women their right to invoke extra-judicial divorce. While there was a huge clamour to retain the practice of 'triple talaq', an un-Islamic practice; no such open and apparent demand seems to exist to restore the right of Muslim women to invoke extra-judicial divorce. The above sketch the miseries of women despite the promise guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution of India".
 At the outset of its 77-page ruling, the Court poses the question of whether it is the intention of the Legislature to do away with extra-judicial divorce otherwise followed by the followers of different schools.
"There is a growing tendency to resist changes being effected upon the Muslim community with regard to the method and manner of effecting divorce consistent with the Quranic injunctions. This dilemma in our country is as old as the Dissolution of Marriage Act, 1939. The question involved in these cases also has to be probed on the anvil of the personal law protected under the statute, 'The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937'".
 How the Court resolves the question
 In the judgment, the Court elaborately discusses the various modes of dissolution of marriage. Prior to its ruling, the Bench first discusses the modes of dissolution in Muslim personal law generally and then proceeds to discuss the modes specifically available to women. The modes available to women, the Court explains is, 
- Talaq-e-tafwiz, where the wife can dissolve the marriage if her husband fails to keep his end of the marriage contract, 
- Khula, where a wife can unilaterally divorce her husband by returning his dower, 
- Mubara'at, dissolution by mutual consent, and 
- Faskh, dissolution with the intervention of a third person such as a qazi.
 The Court noted that the previous legislation governing Muslim marriages and other practices, The Shariat Act of 1937, specifically recognized all modes of extra-judicial divorce except Faskh. Highlighting this, the Court pointed out that Section 2 of the Shariat Act specifically recognized all modes of extra-judicial divorce except Faskh.
 In KC Moyin v. Nafeesa, the High Court had declared that a woman could only resort to remedies under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act and could not invoke remedies under personal law (extra-judicial remedies). 
 Disagreeing with the find after analysing provisions of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, the Court ruled,
 "On an overall analysis of the scheme of the Shariat Act as well as the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act as above, we are of the considered view that the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act restrict Muslim women to annul their marriage invoking Faskh except through the intervention of the Court. All other forms of extra-judicial divorce as referred in Section 2 of the Shariat Act are thus available to a Muslim women. We, therefore, hold that the law declared in K.C.Moyin's case (supra) is not good law.
 On khula
 Holding that a Muslim woman held an unconditional right to invoke a khula, the Court, however, highlighted that any invocation of the same without there being an attempt for reconciliation would be bad in law. 
 "If an unbridled power to invoke khula is given to a Muslim wife, it may result in untold miseries and hardships to both…"
 Further, the man could take recourse to law if the woman did not return her dower.
 "Insistence to return dower or payment of compensation, therefore, are to be understood as husband is legitimately entitled to claim back what is otherwise due to him on account of unilateral invocation of khula by wife," the Court said.
 Since there was no secular law to govern extra-judicial dissolution, the Court proceeded to adjudge principles from the hadith (Prophet's sayings),
 "In the absence of any secular law governing khula, we hold that khula would be valid if the following conditions are satisfied: 
 (i). A declaration of repudiation or termination of marriage by wife. 
 (ii). An offer to return dower or any other material gain received by her during marital tie. 
 (iii). An effective attempt for reconciliation was preceded before the declaration of khula."
 How the Family Courts are to adjudicate extra judicial modes of dissolution
 The Bench pointed out that the there is no difficulty for the Family Court to endorse an extra-judicial divorce to declare the matrimonial status of a person. 
 The Court directed that in the matter of talaq, khula, mubaraat, talaq-e-tafwiz, the Family Courts shall entertain such applications moved by either of the parties or both parties to declare the marital status of such parties.
 Where unilateral modes of dissolution such as khula and talaq, the Court stated that the scope of inquiry before the Family Courts would be limited. In such proceedings, the High Court insisted that the court record the khula or talaq to declare the marital status of the parties after due notice to other party.
 "If any person want(s) to contest the effectiveness of khula or talaq, it is open for such aggrieved person to contest the same in appropriate manner known under law," the Court stated.
 Where consensual modes of dissolution were concerned, such as through the invocation mubaraat and talaq-e-tafwiz, on being satisfied that the dissolution is being effected on mutual consent, the Family Court without further inquiry shall declare the marital status, the Court mandated. 
 The Bench specially instructed Family Courts not to adjudicate upon extra-judicial divorce unless it was called upon to do so in an appropriate manner, since the Courts were overburdened with large number of cases.
 "The Family Court in such matters shall endeavour to dispose the cases treating it as uncontested matter, without any delay by passing a formal order declaring the marital status", the Court said.
"There is a growing tendency to resist changes being effected upon the Muslim community with regard to the method and manner of effecting divorce consistent with the Quranic injunctions"
The Court pointed out the similarities of the practice of Khula to the more widely-known mode of dissolution available to men, the talaq, since both these practices are unilateral modes of divorce. Speaking specifically about a mode of talaq struck down by the Supeme Court, the talaq-e-biddat  (triple talaq), the Court emphasized,
"While there was a huge clamour to retain the practice of 'triple talaq', an un-Islamic practice; no such open and apparent demand seems to exist to restore the right of Muslim women to invoke extra-judicial divorce"
From religious texts, the Court concluded that the khula was derived from the Quran. In this backdrop, the Court additionally observed, "there is a growing tendency to resist changes being effected upon the Muslim community with regard to the method and manner of effecting divorce consistent with the Quranic injunctions."
Underscoring that these deprived the rights of Muslim women to invoke extra judicial divorce, the Court remarked, "these cases speak in abundance about the patriarchal mind-set followed in the Society for decades depriving Muslim women their right to invoke extra-judicial divorce".
Based on these findings, the various petitions were disposed.

The Supreme Court observed that bail cannot be granted to an accused under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, merely on a finding of the absence of possession of the contraband on the person of the accused.
Such a finding does not absolve the court of the level of scrutiny required under Section 37(1)(b)(ii) of the NDPS Act, the bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna observed.
The court reiterated that the test to apply while granting bail is whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the accused has not committed an offence and whether he is likely to commit any offence while on bail.
In this case, the High Court had granted after noticing that a search was conducted in the presence of a gazetted officer in view of the provisions of Section 50 of the NDPS Act but nothing objectionable was recovered from the accused in the course of the personal search. However, it was on search of the car revealed two polythene packets hidden under the place where the wiper is connected to the front bonnet of the car.  
Under Section 37(1)(b)(ii), the limitations on the grant of bail for offences punishable under Sections 19, 24 or 27A and also for offences involving a commercial quantity are :
 (i) The Prosecutor must be given an opportunity to oppose the application for bail; and 
(ii) There must exist 'reasonable grounds to believe' that (a) the person is not guilty of such an offence; and (b) he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.
In appeal, the court noted that the High Court overlooked crucial requirements and glossed over the circumstances which were material to the issue as to whether a case for the grant of bail was established. The bench observed:
"24 As regards the finding of the High Court regarding absence of recovery of the contraband from the possession of the respondent, we note that in Union of India v. Rattan Mallik, a two-judge Bench of this Court cancelled the bail of an accused and reversed the finding of the High Court, which had held that as the contraband (heroin) was recovered from a specially made cavity above the cabin of a truck, no contraband was found in the 'possession' of the accused. The Court observed that merely making a finding on the possession of the contraband did not fulfil the parameters of Section 37(1)(b) and there was non-application of mind by the High Court. In line with the decision of this Court in Rattan Mallik (supra), we are of the view that a finding of the absence of possession of the contraband on the person of the respondent by the High Court in the impugned order does not absolve it of the level of scrutiny required under Section 37(1)(b)(ii) of the NDPS Act."
Regarding the contention that Section 42 of the NDPS Act was not complied with, the court said that the said question should be raised in the course of the trial.
Referring to earlier judgments, the court also held that the knowledge of possession of contraband has to be gleaned from the facts and circumstances of a case. The standard of conscious possession would be different in case of a public transport vehicle with several persons as opposed to a private vehicle with a few persons known to one another, it noted.
"In Mohan Lal v. State of Rajasthan (2015) 6 SCC 222, this Court also observed that the term "possession" could mean physical possession with animus; custody over the prohibited substances with animus; exercise of dominion and control as a result of concealment; or personal knowledge as to the existence of the contraband and the intention based on this knowledge.", the court said.
Applying these principles to this case, the bench set aside the High Court order.

The High Court of Gujarat has held that a third party cannot be impleaded as a party to an application for interim reliefs under Section 9 of the A&C Actunless it is a party who is claiming under a party to the arbitration agreement.
 The Division Bench of Justice N.V. Anjaria and Justice Samir J.Dave has held that the remedy under the Arbitration Act is between the parties to the arbitration agreement, therefore, the third party has no concern with the proceedings of Section 9 nor the said provision recognizes the inclusion of the third party, who may be independently claiming the rights against the parties to the arbitration and vice versa.
 The Court held that the entire basis of granting an interim relief under Section 9 is premised on the fact that the parties have an arbitration agreement between themselves, therefore, a third party is excluded from the ambit of Section 9 relief unless the relief claimed is in respect of those who may be claiming through the party to the agreement.
 The Court held that if an order for interim relief under Section 9 is passed against a third party this would give rise to an anomalous situation as the award passed by the arbitrator is binding only on the parties to the arbitration agreement, therefore, the third party would not be amenable to the final resolution of the disputes.
 Facts
 The parties are partners in a partnership firm named Blue Feathers Infracon. The firm initially had four partners out of which the two partners retired and the firm was reconstituted with the petitioner and respondent being the only remaining partners. 
 The firm purchased a land for the construction of residential flats. The partners obtained a loan of two crores on the said land. The Construction project could not be completed thus, a dispute arose between the parties. 
 Accordingly, the respondent filed an application under Section 9 of the A&C Act for interim measures against the petitioner. The petitioner filed an application under Order I Rule 10 of CPC to join a former partner of the firm and his wife as parties to the application for interim reliefs on the ground that the firm had given an unsecured loan to the wife of the former partner a part of which still remains unpaid and the respondent had himself taken legal action against her, therefore, she is a necessary party for proper adjudication of the dispute. The Commercial Court dismissed the application filed by the petitioner. 
 The Contention Of The Parties
 The petitioner challenged the order of the Court on the following grounds:
 The firm had given an unsecured loan to the wife of the former partner after his retirement and the part of the sum received from her was also adjusted in the sale consideration by the firm when the said property was purchased. A large part of the loan given to her still remains unpaid and the firm's account is required to be settled with the proposed parties.The retiring partner had not given the public notice regarding his retirement; therefore, he is liable to the third parties. The unsettled amount can be recovered from the retired partner; therefore, his presence is mandatory for the proper adjudication of the dispute. The respondent along with the retired partner committed a fraud on the investors thus his presence is required. 
 The respondent countered the arguments of the petitioner on the following grounds:
 The application for the joinder of the former partner along with his wife is a mere dilatory practice. The proposed parties are not at all concerned with the dispute between the parties thus these are neither proper nor necessary parties.
 Analysis By The Court
 The Court held that a third party cannot be impleaded as a party to an application for interim reliefs under Section 9 of the A&C Act unless it is a party who is claiming under a party to the arbitration agreement. 
 The Court also held that the remedy under the Arbitration Act is between the parties to the arbitration agreement, therefore, the third party has no concern with the proceedings of Section 9 nor the said provision recognizes the inclusion of the third party, who may be independently claiming the rights against the parties to the arbitration and vice versa.
 The Court held that the entire basis of granting an interim relief under Section 9 is premised on the fact that the parties have an arbitration agreement between themselves, therefore, a third party is excluded from the ambit of Section 9 relief unless the relief claimed is in respect of those who may be claiming through the party to the agreement.
 The Court held that if an order for interim relief under Section 9 is passed against a third party this would give rise to an anomalous situation as the award passed by the arbitrator is binding only on the parties to the arbitration agreement, therefore, the third party would not be amenable to the final resolution of the disputes.
  The Court held that merely because the firm had to recover some money from the proposed parties, this is not a ground to implead them in an application under Section 9 of the A&C Act. The Court held that the dispute with the proposed parties is outside the ambit of the arbitration clause, therefore, no ground is made out to allow the application. The Court also held that the proposed parties are not such parties who are claiming under any of the parties to the arbitration agreement, therefore, the Court upheld the decision of the Commercial Court and dismissed the Special Civil Application.

The Calcutta High Court on Friday held that considering the abatement in the Covid-19 pandemic and the reopening of schools across the State, its earlier direction stipulating 20 percent reduction in fees charged by private schools would cease to exist from February 16, 2022 onwards with regards to physical classes.

The Calcutta High Court on Friday held that considering the abatement in the Covid-19 pandemic and the reopening of schools across the State, its earlier direction stipulating 20 percent reduction in fees charged by private schools would cease to exist from February 16, 2022 onwards with regards to physical classes. 
The Court observed that schools and other educational institutions shall be permitted to charge fees according to their policy and arrangement with the students from February 16, 2022 onwards. 
A Bench comprising Justice IP Mukherji and Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya was adjudicating upon a bunch of PILs filed by aggrieved parents seeking a partial remission of school fees for the session 2021-2022 due to the ongoing pandemic owing to which students are attending schools only through virtual mediums. The Bench vide its order dated October 13, 2020, had slashed the fees charged by private schools in the State by 20% due to the ongoing pandemic.
On Friday, the Court observed, 
"With prospective effect from 16th February, 2022, that part of our order permitting deduction of 20% of school fees shall stand vacated."
The Bench further opined that considering the substantial remission of the effects of the pandemic, its previously issued interim order must be modified and accordingly remarked further, 
"As the situation stands today, there is substantial remission of the effects of the pandemic. Life in all spheres has become substantially normal. In fact by the notification of the State Government dated 14th February, 2022, even primary and upper primary schools have been thrown open to physical education with effect from 16th February, 2022. Therefore, from now, education in all the schools and other educational institutions covered by this public interest litigation would be physical."
Pertinently, the Court further observed that up to February 28, 2022 with regards to online classes, students will have to pay school fees according to the interim order previously issued by the Court. 
Furthermore, the Court underscored that until March 31, 2022 or until further orders no coercive action can be taken against any student by educational institutions for non-payment of school fees. 
"Till 31st March, 2022 or until further orders, whichever is earlier, no coercive action like expulsion of any student from the school, withholding of admit card to sit for any Board or school examination, withholding of mark-sheets or certificates on the ground of default in payment of school fees, shall be taken by the schools or other educational institutions covered by this litigation against any student", the Court directed. 
Directions Issued 
(a) With prospective effect from 16th February, 2022, that part of our order permitting deduction of 20% of school fees shall stand vacated.
(b) The schools and other educational institutions shall be permitted to charge fees according to their policy and arrangement with the students.
(c) Up to 28th February, 2022, subject to (d) below students shall pay the school fees according to the interim orders made by us prior to this day, for online classes.
(d) In case of any dispute between the school fees claimed and the school fees payable according to a student for the period up to today, 50% (fifty per cent) of the demand by the school or the admitted amount by the student, whichever is higher, has to be paid without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties in this litigation, by 15th March, 2022. Our earlier interim order with regard to payment of the disputed amount stands modified to this extent.
The matter is slated to be heard next on March 25.

The Supreme Court observed that solitary remark regarding lack of integrity is sufficient to order compulsory retirement of a Judicial Officer.
The bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna set aside a Rajasthan High Court judgment which directed reinstatement of a judicial officer who was compulsorily retired.
A judicial officer was compulsorily retired from Rajasthan Higher Judicial Services upon attaining the age of 50 years. The order was passed on the basis of recommendation made by the Administrative Committee which commended to the Full Court of the High Court. However, allowing the writ petition filed by the judicial officer, the High Court, on its judicial side, set aside the order of compulsory retirement, and consequently directed his reinstatement in service with all consequential benefits.
The High Court's administrative side filed appeal in the Supreme Court against the said order of its own judicial side. The issue was whether it was open to the High Court to substitute its view for the one recorded by the Administrative Committee, which commended to the Full Court of the High Court, pursuant to which the order of compulsory retirement came to be issued?
"Indeed, the High Court on judicial side could have done so, if it found that there was absolutely no record or material whatsoever as referred to in the recommendations made by the Administrative Committee, or that the Committee relied on irrelevant material, or that apposite material was overlooked and discarded. Further, the High Court's view would have been acceptable if it found patent illegality, breach of procedure causing prejudice to respondent no.1, or imposition of a gravely disproportionate measure", the court observed.
The court noticed that the Administrative Committee, in its Report, had adverted to the entire service record, including the pending disciplinary enquiry regarding integrity of the judicial officer.
"It is settled position in law that the competent authority is supposed to consider the entire service record of the judicial officer and even if there is a solitary remark of lack and breach of integrity, that may be sufficient for a Judicial Officer to be compulsory retired as expounded in Tarak Singh Vs. Jyoti Basu reported in (2005) 1 SCC 201. The High Court took notice of this judgment, but still ventured to examine the entire record by itself, overlooking the thorough examination conducted by the Administrative Committee, which was affirmed and commended to the Full Court.", the court said.
The court said that it was not open to the High Court to substitute its own view for the satisfaction arrived at by the Full Court of the High Court regarding the necessity or otherwise of the judicial officer continuing in the Rajasthan Higher Judicial Services. It was also not open to the High Court to re-write the annual confidential reports by taking over the role of  inspecting or confirming authority, the court said.
"Suffice it to note that the disciplinary enquiry was pending against respondent no.1 which raised questions about his integrity. Past service record of respondent no. 1 was found to be sub-par and short of the exacting standard expected from a judicial officer. It is also noticed from the record that the disciplinary enquiry came to be dropped in lieu of compulsory retirement of respondent no.1. That was a composite recommendation made by the Administrative Committee and commended to the Full Court of the High Court. The two being inseparable, and the solitary remark about integrity with the service record being sufficient in law to proceed against the judicial officer, we fail to comprehend as to how the conclusion reached by the competent authority can be said to be arbitrary or manifestly wrong.", the bench said while allowing the appeal.

The Allahabad High Court recently directed the Director General of Police, U.P., to issue necessary directions to the Investigating officers regarding preparation of true site plan/map with dimensions in the correct manner and also to take photographs of the spot with smart phones.
The Bench of Justice Rajeev Singh issued this order while allowing the bail plea of a gang rape accused as it noted that in the case, site plan was prepared by the Investigating Officer in a most cursory manner.
The bench also stressed that it is the duty of the Investigating Officer to take all precautions to prepare true site plan with dimensions during the course of the investigation and that it is obligatory for them to show distance from one point to other.
"Director General of Police, U.P., is directed to issue necessary direction in relation to the preparation of true site plan/map with dimensions by the Investigating Officer in the correct manner and also ensure for taking photograph of the spot and annexed with site plan, as nowadays every Investigating Officer is having smart phone," remarked the Allahabad HC.
Essentially, the bail applicant has been booked under Sections 376- D, 377, 506 I.P.C. and Section 3/4, 5 G of the POCSO Act in connection with a rape case of minor. However, the bail applicant argued that he has been falsely implicated on behest of the family of the prosecutrix as they are habitual of using the prosecutrix and her sister as a tool to implicate others in rape cases.
It was further submitted that earlier the sister of the prosecutrix had lodged a rape case against the other villagers and thereafter, she entered into compromise and the final report was submitted by the Investigating Officer. It was also contended that the medico legal report of the prosecutrix does not support the oral testimony of the prosecutrix regarding gang rape allegations.
On the other hand, the AGA opposed the prayer for grant of bail to the applicant but he did not dispute the fact that there was contradiction in the contents of the F.I.R. and the statement of the victim recorded under Section 161 CrPC. and 164 CrPC.
Against this backdrop, considering the rival submissions of the counsel for parties, considering the contents of the F.I.R. and the statement of the brother of the informant as well as medico legal report of the prosecutrix, the Court granted bail to the applicant without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case.

The Delhi High Court has dismissed a plea challenging Delhi University’s policy for seat allocation in admissions to various undergraduate courses in its colleges through Common University Entrance Test, 2022.
A vacation bench of Justice Vibhu Bakhru said the challenge is unsubstantial, and that there is no plausible reason to hold that the Common Seat Allocation System (CSAS) is arbitrary, unreasonable and falling foul of Articles 14 or 21 of the Constitution of India.
The court was hearing a plea moved by two candidates, who apart from challenging the CSAS, also sought permission to change their course or seat mutually.
In the first list of CSAS (First Round) declared on October 18, 2022, one of the petitioners secured 800 out of the maximum of 800 marks whereas the other secured 795 marks in CUET-2022. 
The petitioners were accordingly allocated seats as per their first preference and accepted their admission in St. Stephen’s College. They took admission to the courses of BA Programme and BA (Hons) English, respectively. 
However, later, they felt their first preference was incorrect and sought to alter the same. The varsity had declined their request for such change.
Rejecting the plea, the court noted that the communication received by the petitioners from the University advised the candidates that they would be required to take admissions as offered in the round but would be able to opt for upgradation in subsequent rounds. 
“The use of the word ‘upgradation’ clearly indicates that such participation in further rounds would be available only to those candidates who had not secured admission in accordance with their first preference. Clearly, those students who had secured the admission as per their first preference would have no scope of further ‘upgradation’. In terms of the CSAS, the change of seats as sought by the petitioners is not permissible,” the court said. 
The court also rejected the contention that the petitioners had any right to insist on the change of their seats or to participate in fresh rounds for reallocation of the seats. 
However, the court also said that if the right of other students is not adversely affected, the Delhi University and St. Stephen’s College ought to consider the request made by the petitioners. 
“Thus, although this Court finds no ground to interfere with the CSAS, and as already held that the petitioners have no right to seek the relief as sought; considering that no prejudice would have been caused to any of the students, this Court considers it apposite to direct the respondents to consider this as a one-off case,” the court ordered. 
Justice Bakhru clarified that if the requests of the petitioners are entertained, the same would not constitute a precedent.
Title: BHAVIKAA KESHWANI & ANR. (THROUGH THEIR LEGAL GUARDIANS) v. UNIVERSITY OF DELHI & ANR.

The Kerala High Court on Thursday observed that when the sale of liquor is prohibited for a few days with the object of maintaining peace, preserving public order and for public good, commercial interests takes a back seat, even if it means experiencing a disruption in sales.
A division bench comprising Justice K Vinod Chandran and Justice C. Jayachandran was hearing a batch of appeals and writ petitions filed challenging the order of the lower court that refused to stay the orders by two District Collectors that prohibited FL3 licensees and licensed toddy shops from selling liquor for a few days around three different locations where religious festivals were being held. 
On addressing the concerns of the appellant about the huge losses they have to incur due to such bans, the court said: 
“We quite understand that the licensees have made substantial investments to carry on liquor vending, both foreign liquor and toddy. The disruption of sales for one or two days especially with the object of maintaining peace, for public good and preservation of public order, relegates commercial considerations to the back seat” 
The impugned orders relate to ban on sale of liquor around area of 'Kumbhathiruvathira’ festival in Kadakkal Devi Temple in Kollam and around 'Manappullikkavu Vela' and 'Pattambi Nercha' religious festivals in Palakkad. 
It was argued by the FL3 licensee appellants that such a blanket ban would affect them severely as they have invested significant amounts of money to obtain FL3 licenses, and any sudden restrictions even for a single day would greatly harm their financial interests. It was also argued that the licencees being classified hotels, have also made considerable investments in infrastructure and for promoting tourism.
It was also contented by the appellants that under Section 54 of the Kerala Abkari Act (Closing of shop for the sake of public peace) a notice is required to be served and an opportunity of hearing is to be granted to the licencees. The court while disagreeing with this view point, observed that: 
“We also notice from S.54 that the notice does not necessarily speak of an opportunity for hearing. The notice in writing is only insofar as notice to the licensee to close down a shop, in which intoxicating liquor or drug is sold, for the purpose of preservation of public peace, which notice is only to enable the licensee to arrange his affairs accordingly. In fact, the licensee of a liquor shop has absolutely no say in the preservation of public peace and a hearing conducted would be futile since they cannot instruct the District Administration as to how the law-and-order situation within their jurisdictional limits is to be maintained peaceful” 
It was also the case of the appellants that such a ban in a limited area around the religious festivals does not prevent a person from consuming liquor from outside the prohibited zones and entering the festivals. The court in this regard observed: 
“The contention raised by the appellants that any person could still come intoxicated to the festival, does not permit us to digress from the immediate effects of consumption of liquor, especially when it is readily available at the spot and the deleterious consequences on the unsuspecting public, if the intoxicated person or persons turn violent and engage in criminal activities.” 
The Senior Government Pleader appearing for the state submitted that the orders were issued due to a genuine concern that people of various backgrounds and religions would converge at the festival grounds and many a times violence breaks out between people which is often fuelled by alcohol or drug consumption and disrupts the festivities. Dismissing the writ petitions and appeals and upholding the liquor ban, the court held that:
“festivities in all the three sites have a profusion of pyrotechnics, musical ensemble, colourful displays on caparisoned elephants, exhibitions, fares and the like, providing sufficient entertainment without being further enthused and infused with the toxicity of liquor. True, there could still be drunkenness and brawls resulting from that; but there would be sufficient mitigation and reduced instances, if proximate access to liquor is prohibited.”

The Orissa High Court has reiterated that Courts should be extremely reluctant in imposing their own views disregarding the statutes or rules governing appointment in the field of academics. While declining to interfere in a petition, which sough intervention of the Court against denial of candidature for the want of 'chance certificate', a Single Judge Bench of Dr. Justice Sanjeeb Kumar Panigrahi observed,
 "In the present case, the requirement for chance certificate was let known very categorically in the advertisement issued vide notice no. 225/Director, VIMSAR, Burla dated 19.04.2022 as well as vide a reminder website notice released on 20.05.2022 i.e. five days before the date of original document verification. Hence, this shows the callous attitude of the petitioners. Moreover, chance certificate cannot be considered as an irrelevant document considering that the negative marking attached to it. Therefore, irrespective of its effect on one individual's marks, it has to be considered as a necessary document which must be verified for securing the candidature."
 Factual Background:
 The Respondent-University, on 19.4.2022, issued an advertisement for the post of Asst. Professor on contractual/ deputation basis for different discipline. In the Department of Anaesthesiology, 2 nos. of vacancies were advertised. In the said notice, the qualification criteria was MD or equivalent Degree but for the purpose of merit assessment weightage was only given to mark secured in the Matriculation, Intermediate and MBBS examinations. One of the documents required to be submitted was a 'Chance Certificate' of MBBS /MD /MDS /DNB /MSc (Medical) Examination.
 The petitioners had applied against the said advertisement and were called for document verification. During the document verification, the respondent did not point out any deficiency. On 22.6.2022, a provisional selection list was published in which the petitioners were shown as holding the 3rd (Anaesthesiology) and 8th (pathology) ranks in terms of merit, but were rejected on the ground of non-submission of MD Chance Certificate. Being aggrieved by the same, the petitioners have filed this writ petition.
 Contentions of the Petitioners:
 Ms. Pami Rath, counsel for the petitioners submitted that a 'Chance Certificate' only indicates the number of attempts a person had made to clear an examination. It is required for the purpose of negative marking i.e. deduction of 1 mark for each chance taken for clearing the said exam. Since the petitioners had cleared the exam in their first attempt, they did not require any chance certificate. Moreover, she contended, the pass certificate of the petitioners also stated that they had completed the exam in 2018 as regular candidate. Thus, the information which the Chance Certificate would have given was inherently on record in the form of the 'pass certificate'. Further, it was submitted that the petitioners' non-submission of Chance Certificate pertaining to MD examination does not affect their merit assessment. Therefore, she pressed, they should not have been excluded from the selection.
 Contentions of the Respondents:
 Mr. D. Mund, Additional Government Advocate appearing for the opposite parties, submitted that as per Clause 6.2 of the advertisement, one mark will be deducted from the total career mark for each extra attempt taken to pass the examinations including MD/MS/DNB/MSc (medical) examination. Similarly, Clause 8 of the advertisement provided a list of documents required to be submitted and one of the required documents as per Clause 8(vii) is 'Chance Certificate' of MBBS/MD/MS/MDS/DNB/ MSc (Medical) Examination.
 He further submitted that the petitioners did not take care to obtain their original MD chance certificates in the long period of more than a month from the date of publication of the advertisement on 19.04.2022 till the date of original document verification on 25.05.2022 despite of two reminders in the website one on 13.05.2022 and another on 20.05.2022. He argued that the petitioners had deliberately suppressed the fact to the Court that they had been given a reminder notice vide on 20.05.2022 to present all the required original documents on 25.05.2022 to hide their act of carelessness, which has resulted in the current enmeshment.
 Court's Observations:
 The Court noted, there has been a consistent view of the High Court that in the matter of appointment in academic institutions and Universities that are governed by statutes, the procedural requirements are considered to be mandatory. In the present case, Clause 8 of the advertisement provided a list of documents required to be submitted and one of the required documents as per Clause 8(vii) is Chance Certificate of MBBS/MD/MS/MDS/DNB/ MSc (medical) Examination. Hence, it was a necessary document to be submitted at the time of submission of form as well as at the time of verification of the documents. 
 It further highlighted that the said medical college had also given opportunity to show document (if any) at the time of verification, which the candidates might not have submitted along with the application form. Even after such relaxation, the petitioners did not bother to bring the chance certificate at the time of verification.
 The Court then relied on Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education & Anr. v. Paritosh Bhupesh Kumar Sheth & Ors., wherein it was held,
 "…the Court should be extremely reluctant to substitute its own views as to what is wise, prudent and proper in relation to academic matters in preference to those formulated by professional men possessing technical expertise and rich experience of actual day-to-day working of educational institutions and the departments controlling them. It will be wholly wrong for the Court to make a pedantic and purely idealistic approach to the problems of this nature, isolated from the actual realities and grass-root problems involved in the working of the system and unmindful of the consequences which would emanate if a purely idealistic view as opposed to a pragmatic one were to be propounded."
 Further, it relied on University Grants Commission v. Neha Anil Bobde, wherein it was held that in academic matters, unless there is a clear violation of statutory provisions, the regulations or the notification issued, the Courts shall keep their hands off.
 Accordingly, the Court declined to interfere in the matter and dismissed the petition.

The Madras High Court recently granted permission for conducting Rekla race in connection with the 75th Independence Day Celebration and Aadi Temple Festival in the Bhavani Town of the state's Erode District.
The bench of Justice T. Raja and Justice K. Kumaresh Babu said that since the Rekla race was to be conducted by residents of Erode District as part of the 75th Year Independence Day, therefore, refusing their prayer would send a message that Indians are refused to celebrate even the Independence Day.
It may be noted that Rekla races involve getting bulls tied to purpose-made carts to run a distance. While residents of the southern district celebrate Jallikattu, the people residing in western districts of the State conduct Rekla races.
Essentially, the petitioner (V. Sounthar) and his friends decided to celebrate the 75th Year Independence Day and Aadi Festival on August 14 and August 15, 2022, respectively and as a part of the said celebration, the local people decided to conduct a Rekla race on August 14, 2022.
They sent a representation to the official authorities seeking permission to conduct the race, however, the representation was kept pending, and thus, the petitioner moved to the High Court.
Appearing for the respondents, the Special Government Pleader submitted before the Court that a similar request was already accepted and permission was also granted to conduct a Rekla race on July 31, 2022, to celebrate the Aadi Festival.
However, the petitioner once again gave an application to hold a Rekla race on August 14, 2022, and since they are unnecessarily intoxicating the horses and also indulging in gambling and betting activities, considering the larger public interest, no permission is granted to conduct the Rekla race.
Court's observations/order
At the outset, the Court noted that Independence Day is celebrated by all of us every 15th of August to celebrate freedom from the foreign yoke. The Court also noted that the celebrations are marked by dancing, singing and distributing sweets, and holding different cultural entertainments.
The Court further noted that youngsters and youths in both village and urban sides organize different cultural programmes and various games like Kapadi, Cricket, Silambam, cycle race and motor race to mark India's Independence and also to remember the supreme sacrifices made by the people to get free from the foreign ruling.
In this regard, the Court observed that Rekla Race, sought to be conducted by the petitioner, is one of the cultural programmes which has been in vogue from time immemorial in India like Jallikattu and therefore, the Court opined, the objection raised by the respondents that the bulls participating in the race could be intoxicated is only based on frivolous assumption.
"When the petitioner came forward to conduct the rekla race as part of the 75 th Year Independence Day, we are afraid that refusing their prayer would send a message that Indians are refused to celebrate even the Independence Day...Therefore, when the Nation is also gearing towards the celebration of Our 75 th Year Independence Day in a grand manner, the objections raised by the learned Special Government Pleader that they have already granted permission to another party to hold a similar rekla race on 31.07.2022 cannot be a reasonable objection," the Court further remarked as it allowed the conduct of the race.
The Court directed that the race be conducted on 14.08.2022 between 9.00 a.m. to 12.00 p.m. from Bhavani to Appukudal Road in connection with the 75th Year Independence Day and Aadi Festival by considering the petitioner's representation dated 05.08.2022.
However, the Court did direct that there shall not be any betting or intoxication of bulls and that if there is any violation of any one of the conditions imposed above, the concerned Police Officer is at liberty to take necessary action, as per law and stop the Rekla race forthwith.

The Supreme Court has held that non-disclosure of details of past and pending litigation concerning the subject-matter of the dispute would amount to material suppression of facts, which would disentitle a litigant from discretionary remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution.
The Court also reiterated that while approaching the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution, it is imperative that the petitioner must come with clean hands and put forward all facts before the Court without concealing or suppressing anything.
While noting that jurisdiction exercised by the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is extraordinary, equitable and discretionary, a Bench comprising Justice Abdul Nazeer and Justice Krishna Murari has observed that a litigant is bound to state all facts which are relevant to the litigation. 
The Bench has observed that if some vital or relevant material is withheld by the litigant to gain advantage over the other side, the litigant would be guilty of playing fraud with the court as well as with the opposite parties which cannot be countenanced.
In the present case, the appellants did not disclose the filing of a suit and its dismissal and also the dismissal of the appeal against the judgment of the civil court by the High Court.
Considering the same, the Bench observed that the appellants have to be non-suited on the ground of suppression of material facts.
"They have not come to the court with clean hands and they have also abused the process of law. Therefore, they are not entitled for the extraordinary, equitable and discretionary relief", the Bench observed 
The Bench observed that is clear that the appellants have suppressed these material facts which are relevant for deciding the question involved in the writ petitions.
The Bench stated that the parties have to disclose the details of all legal proceedings and litigations either past or present concerning any part of the subject-matter of dispute which is within their knowledge for the following reasons: 
In order to check multiplicity of proceedings pertaining to the same subject-matter.To stop the menace of soliciting inconsistent orders through different judicial forums by suppressing material facts either by remaining silent or by making misleading statements in the pleadings in order to escape the liability of making a false statement
"...in order to check multiplicity of proceedings pertaining to the same subject-matter and more importantly to stop the menace of soliciting inconsistent orders through different judicial forums by suppressing material facts either by remaining silent or by making misleading statements in the pleadings in order to escape the liability of making a false statement, we are of the view that the parties have to disclose the details of all legal proceedings and litigations either past or present concerning any part of the subject-matter of dispute which is within their knowledge"
According to the Court, in cases where according to the parties to the dispute, no legal proceedings or court litigations was or is pending, the same has to be mandatorily stated in their pleadings.
The observations have been made by the Bench in appeals filed challenging Karnataka High Court's 2013 order in review petition filed by appellants pursuant to the liberty granted by this top Court. However, the High Court declined to review its earlier order.
The appellants herein are the sons of one M. Krishna Reddy and had filed writ petitions before the High Court of Karnataka for cancellation of allotment at two sites allotted in favour of two respondents and for certain other reliefs.
The land in question, a part of which was owner by appellant's father was notified for acquisition by the Bangalore Development Authority. The Notification for acquisition in respect of the entire 5 acres 9 guntas had been issued by the Bangalore Development Authority and possession of the land had been been.
 The contention of the appellants is that their father,as the owner of 1 acre 26 guntas of land and 08 guntas of land had not been acquired and compensation had not been paid in respect of this land. 
The Apex Court has observed that according to records produced by the BDA would disclose that 08 guntas of land is kharab-B land. Therefore, there is no question of payment of compensation in respect of this land.
The appellants also claimed enhanced compensation also for 1 acre 18 guntas of land and they have raised this issue at a highly belated stage after lapse of about 34 years.
The Bench noted that Identical contentions were raised by the appellants in its suit, the said suit was dismissed and the judgment of the civil court was confirmed by the High Court. 
The High Court however noted that the materials placed on record clearly indicated that the entire extent of land had been acquired by the BDA for public purposes and the compensation had been paid thereon. Further, it was not in dispute that the plaintiff's father had participated in the acquisition proceedings before the BDA. Therefore when the entire extent of land has been acquired, the High Court found it difficult to accept the appellant's stand
The Bench has observed that finding of the High Court has attained finality and the writ court cannot sit in an appeal over the judgment passed by the High Court in the appeal.

The Delhi High Court has observed that while the task of deciding the marital status of the parties has been conferred with Civil Courts, the Court under maintenance proceedings under sec. 125 of the Cr.P.C. may not usurp the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts.
Justice Chandra Dhari Singh added that in order to preserve the social intent of sec. 125 of the Cr.P.C., the Magistrate can render the prima facie finding about the factum of marriage, which will not be a conclusive finding for any other purpose apart from the order on maintenance.
"Thus, the litmus test for determining the marital status of the parties in maintenance proceedings is prima facie satisfaction of the concerned Magistrate and nothing more. It is also pertinent to note that the abovementioned decisions bring out the fact that the proceedings under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. are designed to reduce the vagaries of the neglected wife and children," the Court said. 
Reiterating that the Revisional Court need not re-assess or re-appreciate the material and evidence on record before the Trial Court, the Court observed:
"A Revisional Court is to limit its jurisdiction for adjudicating upon the material illegalities and irregularities apparent in the impugned orders. The conclusive determination of marital status in cases of maintenance under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., shall therefore, be declared by the Civil Court and the Revisional Court shall restrain itself to the questions before it without reopening the evidence."
The Court was dealing with a plea filed by the a man seeking setting aside of the Order dated 3rd April, 2018 passed by a Family Court, whereby he was directed to pay maintenance of Rs. 4,000 per month to his wife and Rs. 3,000 to two children each after they attain the age of maturity, alongwith litigation expenses of Rs. 11,000. 
It was stated that prior to the wife's marriage with the Petitioner, she was married and had four children out of that wedlock. It was alleged that the Petitioner had accepted her children and gave his name as their father in the school records.
It was further stated that the Petitioner along with respondents and said four children were residing together at their matrimonial house. However, due to disputes between the first wife of the Petitioner and present wife, the Petitioner had purchased a separate property and started living there alongwith the Respondents.
Subsequently, due to certain matrimonial issues between the parties, the Petitioner stopped paying maintenance to the Respondents and aggrieved by the same, the wife had filed a maintenance petition for herself and their two children under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. The Trial Court was of the opinion that the wife had established her relationship with the Petitioner as his wife and she was entitled to seek maintenance from him.
"A bare reading of the Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. suggests that the intention of the legislature while making the provision for maintenance was to ensure that a person shall oblige with his matrimonial and familial obligations of maintaining his wife and children, when they do not have sufficient means to sustain themselves. The power to adjudicate on the issue of maintenance has been given, at the first instance, to the Magistrate, who may upon being satisfied direct the concerned person to provide such maintenance/monthly allowance to his wife, children or parents. There is, therefore, a discretionary power with the Magistrate that is to be exercised while appreciating the evidence and material on record when awarding maintenance to the parties," the Court observed. 
The Court added that in matrimonial matters, the question of marriage between the parties may be raised during the preliminary stage and be considered and decided to the prima facie satisfaction of the Court.
"In so far as proving the existence of a marital relationship between the parties is concerned, the burden of proof would lie on the party alleging that such marriage has been solemnized in accordance with the law applicable, be it statutory or personal. However, the extent of proof is limited to the prima facie satisfaction and the need to prove it strictly and/or beyond reasonable doubt does not arise," it added. 
With the aforesaid observations, the Court upheld the impugned order while finding no illegality in the findings and analysis of the Trial Court in upholding the existence of a martial relationship between the parties and accordingly, awarded maintenance to the Respondents.
"The learned Family Court, Karkardooma, Delhi, vide its judgment dated 3rd April, 2018, has taken the right view in light of the circumstances present before it. This Court does not find any substantial ground for invoking the Revisional Jurisdiction to interfere with the impugned judgment," the Court said while dismissing the petition.

Ocular evidence is considered the best evidence unless there are reasons to doubt it, the Supreme Court observed while setting aside an order of High Court that acquitted an accused in a murder case.
The bench comprising Justices Navin Sinha and R. Subhash Reddy observed that the ocular evidence may be disbelieved only when there is a gross contradiction between medical evidence and oral evidence, and the medical evidence makes the ocular testimony improbable and rules out all possibility of ocular evidence being true.
In this case, the High Court had reversed the Trial Court order convicting the accused on the ground that the evidence of the eye­witnesses is inconsistent with the medical evidence, regarding the nature of injuries vis­à­vis the weapons of offence.
The bench, referring to evidence on record, addressed the contention that identification was not possible in the night to give them the benefit of doubt.
"There is evidence about the availability of light near the place of occurrence. Even otherwise, that there may not have been any source of light is hardly considered relevant in view of the fact that the parties were known to each other from earlier. The criminal jurisprudence developed in this country recognizes that the eye sight capacity of those who live in rural areas is far better than compared to the town folks. Identification at night between known persons is acknowledged to be possible by voice, silhouette, shadow, and gait also. Therefore, we do not find much substance in the submission of the respondents that identification was not possible in the night to give them the benefit of doubt. " [relied on Nathuni Yadav vs State of Bihar, (1998) 9 SCC 238]
The court also observed that the High Court grossly erred in appreciation of evidence by holding that the alleged weapon was a simple iron rod without noticing the evidence that it had a sharp turn edge. :
"17. Ocular evidence is considered the best evidence unless there are reasons to doubt it. The evidence of PW­2 and PW­10 is unimpeachable. It is only in a case where there is a gross contradiction between medical evidence and oral evidence, and the medical evidence makes the ocular testimony improbable and rules out all possibility of ocular evidence being true, the ocular evidence may be disbelieved. In the present case, we find no inconsistency between the ocular and medical evidence. The High Court grossly erred in appreciation of evidence by holding that muddamal no.5 was a simple iron rod without noticing the evidence that it had a sharp turn edge."
While restoring the conviction recorded by the Trial Court, the bench said that the acquittal by the High Court is based on misappreciation of  the evidence and the overlooking of relevant evidence thereby arriving at a wrong conclusion.
"18...It is not a case where two views are possible or the credibility of the witnesses is in doubt. Neither is it a case of a solitary uncorroborated witness. The conclusion of the High Court is therefore held to be perverse and irrational. The acquittal is therefore held to be unsustainable and is set aside. In the nature of the assault, Section 304 Part II, IPC has no application.", the court said. 
The bench also directed the accused to surrender within two weeks to serve out the remaining period of their sentence.

The suo moto proceedings initiated by the Kerala High Court for the protection of animal rights in the State was renamed to In Re: Bruno
 in memory of the hapless dog that succumbed to the inhuman acts of three youngsters. In a heartwarming gesture, a Division Bench of Justices Jayasankaran Nambiar and P Gopinath directed the Registry to rename the writ in memory of the dog, apart from using suggestions to promote animal welfare in the State. 
 "To begin with, we direct the Registry to rename this writ petition as "In Re: Bruno (Suo Moto Public Interest Litigation Proceedings initiated by the High Court in the matter of executive and legislative inaction of the State Government in the matter of Protection of Animal Rights)". We feel that this would be a fitting tribute to the hapless dog that succumbed to acts of human cruelty, and disturbed by which incident we had initiated these proceedings," the order passed today said."

  Background: 
 The Kerala High Court had registered a suo motu PIL yesterday to monitor state action in reported instances of cruelty to animals and in the matter o prevention of cruelty to animals. Following this, notices were issued to the Centre, State and Animal Welfare Board of India respectively. 
 This came after Justice Jayasankaran Nambiar addressed a letter to the CJI urging to take cognizance of a news report of three minors perpetrating the inhuman killing of a dog on a beach in Thiruvananthapuram. Although a police case had been registered in the matter, the letter emphasized the prosecution in related matters was seldom purposive and expeditious. 
 The primary concern expressed in the letter was that the Indian legislations for protection of animals were founded on the premise of superiority of human species over all others 
 In the said letter, it was stated that time has now come to push the State and its instrumentalities into taking affirmative action to safeguard the rights of Animals. It had elaborated on several instances where the judiciary had upheld such rights for the welfare of animals. 
Directions passed by the bench
The Court has directed the Kerala State Animal Welfare State (KSAWS) to file a report before the court as regards the action taken till date on the complaint received from the owner of the dog, Bruno. 
The court urged the Director-General of Prosecution, to bestow his personal attention in the matter and ensure that the wheels of the criminal justice system are set in motion to bring to book the perpetrators of the crime.
The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) has been asked by the court to draw up a feasible action plan towards implementing an awareness campaign to educate and sensitize citizens on the rights of animals and the corresponding duties and obligations required of them.
"We believe that immediate steps in this regard are required to initiate a change in the attitude of our citizenry to the welfare of animals so that gruesome incidents, such as those reported in the media in recent times, do not recur in future", the court said.
The Court ordered the state government to explore the possibility of promoting and holding animal adoption camps throughout the state, at periodic intervals of not less than thrice a year, where persons can be encouraged to adopt animals that have been abandoned by their owners, and are left to wander in the streets in search of food and shelter. Besides, it asked the government to explore the possibility of entrusting the District Administrations across the State, with the power to enquire into complaints of infringement of animal rights and cruelty to animals, as also instances where persons are prevented from keeping pets of their choice in their residential apartments
"Our sole endeavour will be to alert the State Executive to the circumstances in which, and the extent to which, it will be required to act in discharge of its constitutional and statutory obligations. We believe that a meaningful effectuation of rights can be achieved only when the different branches of Government work in concert, and it is this cooperation that we expect in the course of these proceedings", the court said.

The Delhi High Court has set aside the award passed by a Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (MACT) where it had refused to grant recovery rights to the Insurance Company against the driver/owner of a two-wheeler involved in an accident.
While rejecting the insurance company's argument that it is not liable to pay anything as the rider was not holding a valid licence to drive the two-wheeler, the MACT had said that a male person who is competent to drive a Light Motor Vehicle cannot be expected to be incompetent in driving a two-wheeler
Observing that the presumption made by the MACT was without any basis, Justice Rekha Palli said that a person who can drive a four-wheeler cannot be automatically presumed to be competent to drive a two-wheeler since the skills required for driving the two vehicles are quite different.
While ruling that the MACT failed to observe that a Light Motor Vehicle and a two-wheeler have been placed in two distinct categories under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the court said, “Merely because respondent no. 2 held a valid licence for a Light Motor Vehicle could not imply that he was authorised or competent to drive a two wheeler.”
In an appeal filed before the high court against the order of the MACT, the appellant, HDFC Ergo General Insurance Co. Ltd, argued that in view of the unrebutted testimony of the Record Clerk from the Sarai Kale Khan Transport Authority, New Delhi, it was clear that the driver did not have a valid licence to drive a two-wheeler, and thus, the terms and conditions of the insurance policy stood breached. 
HDFC Ergo contended that the MACT had failed to consider the same while refusing to grant it recovery rights against the driver/owner of the vehicle.
The court said the Record Clerk from Sarai Kale Khan Transport Authority, South Zone, had categorically stated before the tribunal that the private respondent was authorised to drive only a Light Motor Vehicle—Transport - LMV-TR (Commercial Vehicle), and not a two-wheeler.
“However, I find that despite having noted the categoric stand of the transport authority that the respondent no.2, driver of the offending vehicle, did not hold a valid licence to drive a two wheeler, which he was driving at the time of the accident, the learned Tribunal rejected the appellant’s plea that it was not liable to pay compensation,” the court said.
The bench further observed that the high court in Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Akram Hussain & Ors., MAC.APP.306/2009, was dealing with a similar issue, where it has been held that it could not be assumed that every person who is competent to drive Light Motor Vehicle would be skilled in driving a two-wheeler as well.
Observing that it is evident that the offending vehicle was being driven by a person who did not have a driving licence for it, the court said it was a clear case where there was a breach of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.
“Consequently, the finding of the learned Tribunal that the appellant was liable to pay the compensation is unsustainable and is set aside. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed by modifying the impugned award to the extent it does not grant any recovery rights in favour of the appellant by directing that the appellant would be entitled to recover the awarded amount from respondent no. 2 in accordance with law,” the court ruled.

"...no accused person is incapable of being reformed and therefore, all measures should be applied to give them an opportunity of reformation in order to bring them in the social stream," the Allahabad High Court recently observed as it modified the sentence of an accused convicted under Section 304 Part 1 IPC.
The bench of Justice Dr. Kaushal Jayendra Thaker and Justice Ajai Tyagi further stressed that undue harshness should be avoided while sentencing keeping in view the reformative approach underlying our criminal justice system.
The case in brief
The bench was hearing an appeal moved one Babu, who was convicted under Section 304(i) read with Section 34 IPC and under Section 4/25 Arms by the Court of Additional Session Judge, Badaun in Mya 2013.
The convict/appellant, along with co-accused Munna, was found guilty of killing Rani (deceased). As per the case of the prosecution, on April 20, 2010, the complainant (Kamlesh) was returning home with her mother Rani (deceased) after purchasing the vegetables.
Both the accused came from behind and Babu put his hand on the shoulder of her mother, her mother gave a jerk and moved ahead, which annoyed Babu and he drove out a knife from his clothes and stabbed her mother in the abdomen. Both the accused ran away. Rani died later on.
Before the Court after some arguments, the counsel for the appellant submitted that he was not pressing this appeal on its merit, but he prayed only for a reduction of the sentence. 
He submitted that the sentence of life imprisonment awarded to the appellant by the trial court was very harsh. He also submitted that the appellant is in jail for the past more than 9 years.
Court's observations
At the outset, the Court noted that nothing had come out, which could give any benefit to the appellant. The Court noted that the knife, used in the commission of the crime, was recovered by the investigating officer on the pointing out of the accused-appellant Babu. 
The Court further noted that the Medical evidence also shows that injury No.2 in ante mortem injuries, mentioned in post mortem report, is the injury that could be inflicted by a weapon like a knife. Hence, the Court observed that the ocular version of eye-witness PW2 was corroborated by medical evidence also.
Consequently, while coming to the conclusion that the accused is the perpetrator of the offence, the Court considered the question as to whether the sentence of life imprisonment and fine was adequate or the sentence was required to be modified.
The Court took into account the rulings of the Apex Court to state that while considering the imposition of appropriate punishment, the impact of crime on society as a whole and rule of law needs to be balanced. 
Further stressing that the judicial trend in the country has been towards striking a balance between reform and punishment, the Court remarked thus:
"The protection of society and stamping out criminal proclivity must be the object of law which can be achieved by imposing appropriate sentence on criminals and wrongdoers. Law, as a tool to maintain order and peace, should effectively meet challenges confronting the society, as society could not long endure and develop under serious threats of crime and disharmony. It is therefore, necessary to avoid undue leniency in imposition of sentence. Thus, the criminal justice jurisprudence adopted in the country is not retributive but reformative and corrective. At the same time, undue harshness should also be avoided keeping in view the reformative approach underlying in our criminal justice system."
Further, the Court also noted that in the instant case, the sentence awarded by the learned trial court for a life term was very harsh keeping in view the entirety of the facts and circumstances of the case and the gravity of offence.
Hence, the sentence awarded to the appellant Babu by the trial court was modified as a sentence of 10 years rigorous imprisonment under Section 304 Part I read with Section 34 IPC and a fine of Rs.10,000/-.

The Supreme Court has observed that the Central Bureau of Investigation can investigate into specified offence committed within Union Territory, by an accused residing in or employed in connection with the affairs of another State, without the consent of that state.

The Supreme Court has observed that the Central Bureau of Investigation can investigate into specified offence committed within Union Territory, by an accused residing in or employed in connection with the affairs of another State, without the consent of that state.
The issue raised in this case was whether the CBI was authorised to register cases against the public servants employed in connection with the affairs of the Government of Bihar. The contention raised by the accused, who was allegedly involved in a cheating case, was that, he being an officer of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) employed in connection with the affairs of the Government of Bihar as District Magistrate at Aurangabad District (State of Bihar) could not be subjected to investigation by the CBI without the prior consent of the State. 
After examining the scheme of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, the bench comprising Justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari observed that such a consent may not be necessary regarding the investigation by the special police force (DSPE) in respect of specified offences committed within Union Territory and other offences associated therewith. The bench observed:
"That may be so, even if one of the accused involved in the given case may be residing or employed in some other State (outside the Union Territory) including in connection with the affairs of the State/local body/corporation, company or bank of the State or controlled by the State/institution receiving or having received financial aid from State Government, as the case may be. Taking any other view would require the special police force to comply with the formality of taking consent for investigation even in relation to specified offence committed within Union Territory, from the concerned State merely because of the fortuitous situation that part of the associated offence is committed in other State and the accused involved in the offence is residing in or employed in connection with the affairs of that State. Such interpretation would result in an absurd situation especially when the 1946 Act extends to the whole of India and the special police force has been constituted with a special purpose for investigation of specified offences committed within the Union Territory, in terms of notification issued under Section 3 of the 1946 Act."
Taking note of the contents of FIR, the Court observed that the State police had no jurisdiction to investigate the offence in question, as registered, and therefore there is no need to seek consent of the State in respect of such offence. It said:
"Indisputably, the registered office of BRBCL is within the jurisdiction of Union Territory of Delhi (National Capital Territory of Delhi) and allegedly the offence has been committed at Delhi, for which reason the Delhi Court will have jurisdiction to take cognizance thereof. To put it differently, the offence in question has been committed outside the State of Bihar. The investigation of the stated offence may incidentally transcend to the territory of State of Bihar because of the acts of commission and omission of the appellant who is resident of that State and employed in 27 connection with the affairs of the State of Bihar. That, however, cannot come in the way of special police force (DSPE) from investigating the offence committed at Delhi and has been so registered by it and is being investigated. Had it been an offence limited to manipulation of official record of the State and involvement of officials of the State of Bihar, it would have been a different matter. It is not the case of the appellant or the State of Bihar that even an offence accomplished at Delhi of defrauding of the Government of India undertaking (having registered office at Delhi) and siphoning of the funds thereof at Delhi can be investigated by the State of Bihar. If the State police has had no jurisdiction to investigate the offence in question, as registered, then, seeking consent of the State in respect of such offence does not arise. Any other approach would render the special provisions of the 1946 Act otiose."
Regarding the contention on 1996 Notification provision, the bench observed thus:
"Indeed, the said notification contains a proviso, which predicates that if any public servant employed in connection with the affairs of the Government of Bihar is concerned in offences being investigated by the special police force pursuant to the notification, prior consent of the State Government qua him shall be obtained. This proviso must operate limited to cases or offences which have been committed within the territory of the State of Bihar. If the specified offence is committed outside the State of Bihar, as in this case in Delhi, the State police will have no jurisdiction to investigate such offence and for which reason seeking consent of the State to investigate the same would not arise. In our opinion, the stated proviso will have no application to the offence in question and thus the Delhi special police force/DSPE (CBI) must be held to be competent to register the FIR at Delhi and also to investigate the same without the consent of the State."
Case no.: CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 414 OF 2020 Case name: Kanwal Tanuj vs. State of Bihar Coram: Justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari 
Read Judgment

The Gujarat High Court has permitted the Vadodara Municipal Corporation to rely on a previous blacklisting order passed by it against a Road Contractor, which was set aside by the High Court for being non-compliant with principles of natural justice, while issuing a fresh notice to the contractor in relation to three work orders.
However, the Bench comprising Chief Justice Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh J. Shastri made it clear that the Corporation shall have to justify the same while passing the final order in the matter.
"Merely because said resolution dated 31.12.2019 has been set aside would not by itself empower the petitioner to contend that respondent could not rely upon the same inasmuch as the Coordinate Bench while setting aside order dated 31.12.2018 has remanded the matter back to the Corporation for adjudication afresh. If the authorities deem it proper to rely upon their own earlier order, it is for them to justify it while passing final order. In that view of the matter, we do not see any infirmity to interfere at this juncture."
The bench added that this would not mean that the petitioner-contractor can be treated as a blacklisted person.The Petitioner was initially blacklisted by the Corporation vide resolution dated December 31, 2018 on the ground of petitioner having indulged into irregularities and causing loss to the Corporation and by the very same order, payments due to the petitioner were withheld.
This order came to be set aside by a Coordinate bench of the High Court on the short ground that it was passed in violation of principles of natural justice, without even issuing show cause notice to petitioner and without hearing the petitioner. The bench had remanded the matter back to the Corporation and granted liberty to pass fresh orders after granting an opportunity to the petitioner.
Thereafter, a notice dated April 22, 2019 was issued to the petitioner, which came to be challenged herein on the ground that resolution dated December 31, 2018 has been set aside and therefore, Corporation while issuing impugned notice could not have relied upon the said resolution.
The High Court observed that the Petitioner could not have any grievance to contend that such notice could not have been issued or in the said notice, resolution dated December 31, 2018 could not have been relied upon by Corporation.
"It is open for the authorities to decide, adjudicate and resolve the said notice which is issued for blacklisting the petitioner by considering the reply submitted by the petitioner, which is already on record, vide Annexure-H dated 30.4.2019. Merely because said resolution dated 31.12.2019 has been set aside would not by itself empower the petitioner to contend that respondent could not rely upon the same inasmuch as the Coordinate Bench while setting aside order dated 31.12.2018 has remanded the matter back to the Corporation for adjudication afresh."
 Accordingly, the Bench directed that the Petitioner appear before the Respondent authority without waiting for orders from the High Court or the notice from the Respondent Corporation.
 Case Title: DIVYA SIMANDHAR CONSTRUCTION PRIVATE LIMITED v/s VADODARA MUNICIPAL CORPORATION
 Case No.: C/SCA/1322/2022

The Karnataka High Court has said the bar under Section 199 CrPC on a Magistrate from exercising powers under section 156(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) on a complaint involving offences punishable under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code, would be applicable even in cases where offences are alleged for other offences in addition with Section 500 of the IPC.
Section 199 stipulates that no Court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under Chapter XXI (Defamation) of IPC except upon a "complaint" made by some person aggrieved by the offence.
 A single judge bench of Justice M. Nagaprasanna made the above observation while allowing a petition filed by Divya and another, calling in question proceedings before Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore arising out of a private complaint registered for offences punishable under Sections 211, 500 and 499 of the IPC.
 Case Details:
 The petitioners and the complainant/ 2nd respondent are residents of the same apartment complex "Brigade Gateway". A complaint was registered by the 2nd respondent invoking Section 200 of the Cr.P.C. against the petitioners alleging that registration of a complaint on an alleged false incident has tarnished the image of the complainant in the eyes and minds of the residents of the apartment complex.
 The Magistrate on 06-06-2016 directed investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. to be conducted by the jurisdictional Police and a report to be submitted. The Police, after investigation, filed a charge sheet in the matter for offences punishable under Sections 211, 499, 500 r/w Section 34 of the IPC.
 Petitioner submissions:
 It was submitted that the Magistrate could not have directed investigation by the Police in the matter of defamation as there can be no involvement of the Police. It was would further submitted that there is nothing that is defamatory in the complaint that was lodged before the Police or the President of the Association and under Section 199 of the Cr.P.C. the complainant cannot be claimed to be an aggrieved person.
 Complainant's arguments:
 The counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent contended that the petitioners had foisted a false case against the complainant and the allegations did require an investigation as Sections 211 and 34 of the IPC were also part of the FIR that was registered or the charge sheet that is filed by the Police after investigation and it is a matter of trial that the petitioners have to come out clean, as they have admittedly tarnished the image of the complainant in the eyes of the residents of the apartment complex who are members of the Association.
 Court findings:
 The bench said, "The instant case concerns defamation under Section 499 of the IPC which becomes punishable under Section 500 of the IPC. Therefore, there cannot be any controversy about how the learned Magistrate should take cognizance of the offence. The cognizance shall be taken only on a complaint and not on a report filed by the Police."
 It added, 
"In the case at hand, when the complaint came to be registered, the learned Magistrate fell in error in directing investigation to be conducted by the Police under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. and thereafter takes cognizance of the offences on filing of the report by the Police."
 The bench then relied on Subramaniam Swamy v. Union of India, (2016) 7 SCC 221, where it was held that where the complaint before the Magistrate involves offence punishable under Section 500 of the IPC, the Magistrate cannot exercise powers under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. so as to direct Police to register a crime and then investigate into the offence, in view of the specific bar contained in Section 199 of the Cr.P.C. This would become applicable even in cases where offences are alleged of other provisions of law along with Section 500 of the IPC.
 Accordingly, it held, "In the light of the judgment of the Apex court and that of the learned single Judge of the High Court of Kerala (supra) interpreting Sections 199, 499 and 500 of the IPC, the order of the learned Magistrate directing investigation is rendered unsustainable and all proceedings thereto would be a nullity in law. Therefore, the proceedings are necessarily to be obliterated and the matter remitted back to the learned Magistrate to take up such proceedings bearing in mind the observations made in the course of the order."
 Thus, it allowed the petition and set aside the order of the magistrate court and directed the Magistrate to take up further proceedings in the case from the stage of registration of the complaint and all appropriate action thereon, in accordance with law.
 Case Title: DIVYA & ANR v. STATE OF KARNATAKA and Anr
 Case No: CRIMINAL PETITION No.675 OF 2020 
 Date of Order: 25TH DAY OF MAY, 2022 
 Appearance: Advocate VISHNUMURTHY for petitioner; Advocate K.P.YASHODHA, HCGP FOR R1; Advocate K.J.KAMATH, FOR R2

The Karnataka High Court has expressed deep anguish over the actions of Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB) and its officials who for almost 15 years failed to pay compensation to landowners whose properties were acquired for public purpose in 2007.
 Justice Krishna S Dixit, while partly allowing the petition filed by one M V Guruprasad, said, “The government cannot act as a robber of citizen’s lands.”
 “Taking away private lands for the purported public purpose sans compensation militates against the spirit of constitutional guarantee enacted u/a 300A, the fundamental right to property no longer being on the statute book, notwithstanding,” it added
 The court also said that State and its instrumentalities are constitutionally expected to conduct themselves with fairness & reasonableness in all their actions.
 The petitioners had approached the court against the acquisition of land done vide Preliminary Notification dated 09.01.2007, followed by the Final Notification dated  17.05.2007 issued under provisions of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966.
 The authority opposed the plea saying that acquisition having been completed by issuance of Final Notification on 17.05.2007, the lands have vested in the State and therefore, the same cannot be restored to petitioners. 
"After the land owners notified the change of khatha pursuant to subject sale deeds, the Government had issued a Corrigendum Notification on 05.06.2014 mentioning their names and because of the protocol process, there is some delay and now the payment of compensation will be made," the State said.
 The bench noted that on the date of Preliminary Notification, names of the Petitioners had not figured as khatedars in the Revenue Records and therefore, the KIADB was justified in notifying the acquisition in the names of their vendors, who were the Khatedars.
It further said that petitioners by representation dated 09.01.2013 had requested the KIADB for payment of the compensation for having taken their lands and had also sent the reminder dated 01.07.2014 & 03.07.2014. 
"In fact, the Government issued a Corrigendum Notification dated 05.06.2014 mentioning their names and thereby entitling them to payment of compensation. However, compensation has not been paid even to this day. There is no plausible explanation as to why the payment of compensation is withheld for decade and a half. It hardly needs to be stated that payment of compensation is essential when private property is acquired for public purpose," it added.
 Noting that the petitioner’s property has vested in the State vide Final Notification dated 17.05.2007, the bench said, “KIADB ought to have woken up and arranged for payment of the payment of compensation. However, strangely it has filed its Statement of Objections seeking dismissal of the petition contending that they have already developed the land and allotted the same to several entrepreneurs.”
 Further noting that in the entire Statement of Objections, neither the State nor the KIADB has said anything about the compensation being payable to the Petitioners, the bench said such a conduct reinforces the "shackles of a feudalistic attitude, from which the transformative character of our constitution seeks to liberate.”
 “Their action in not paying the compensation is not only grossly violative of property rights constitutionally guaranteed under Article 300A but gnaws at overarching objectives of a Welfare State ordained under the Constitution," said the court.
 Observing that this court cannot deny justice that is eminently due to the aggrieved citizens by quoting some constitutional theories, the bench said: “The petitioners be paid at least 50% of the compensation to be computed under provisions of the 2013 Act, (Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act), along with solatium, interest & such other things.”
 It clarified that in special circumstances of the case and because of the stay of a Coordinate Bench decision in a case wherein the court has directed payment of compensation under the 2013 Act, "The provisions of the 2013 Act are taken only for the purpose of determining/re-fixing the compensation amount on a normative basis till after & subject to decision in the Writ Appeal."
 It added: “Writ Courts being the custodians of Constitutional Rights of the citizens, have to individualise justice taking into account the facts & circumstances of the case at hand.”

The Supreme Court  observed that a dependent/applicant cannot seek compassionate appointment on the higher post than what was held by the deceased employee.
The Court observed that the appointment on compassionate ground is a concession and not a right. It is an exception to the general rule of appointment in the public services and is in favour of the dependents of a deceased dying in harness and leaving his family in penury and without any means of livelihood, the bench of Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna observed.
In this case, the deceased employee at the time of his death was posted and serving as Messenger in Police Radio Department of Uttar Pradesh (Class­ IV). The Single Bench of the High Court dismissed the  writ petition filed by the widow of the deceased employee on the ground that as the deceased employee was Class­ IV employee and she has also been offered appointment on a Class ­IV post, she cannot claim the appointment on compassionate ground on the post of Workshop Hand or on any other suitable Class­ III post. In appeal, the Division bench allowed her writ petition observing that  appointment under Rule 5 of Dying­ In ­Harness Rules 1974 is required to be given on a "suitable post" and the term 'suitable' in Rule 5 pertains to suitability of the person who desires for appointment and it has nothing to do with the post held by the deceased government servant.
In appeal before the Apex Court, the Government contended that 'suitable post' mentioned in Rule 5 of Rules 1974 has to be construed considering the educational qualification of dependent vis­à­vis the post held by the deceased employee. 
Agreeing with the said argument, the court observed that the 'Suitable post' has to be considered, considering status/post held by the deceased employee and the educational qualification/eligibility criteria is required to be considered, considering the post held by the deceased employee and the suitability of the post is required to be considered vis a vis the post held by the deceased employee. 
"10.2.......Otherwise there shall be no difference/distinction between the appointment on compassionate ground and the regular appointment. In a given case it may happen that the dependent of the deceased employee who has applied for appointment on compassionate ground is having the educational qualification of Class­II or Class­I post and the deceased employee was working on the post of Class/Grade IV and/or lower than the post applied, in that case the dependent/applicant cannot seek the appointment on compassionate ground on the higher post than what was held by the deceased employee as a matter of right, on the ground that he/she is eligible fulfilling the eligibility criteria of such higher post. The aforesaid shall be contrary to the object and purpose of grant of appointment on compassionate ground which as observed hereinabove is to enable the family to tide over the sudden crisis on the death of the bread earner.", the court said while allowing the appeal.
The court made the following observations in the judgment:
The compassionate ground is a concession and not a right.
Referring to a recent judgment in Director of Treasuries in Karnataka vs. V. Somashree, the court observed: 
9. As per the law laid down by this court in catena of decisions on the appointment on compassionate ground, for all the government vacancies equal opportunity should be provided to all aspirants as mandated under Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution. However, appointment on compassionate  ground offered to a dependent of a deceased employee is an exception to the said norms. The compassionate ground is a concession and not a right.
The whole object of granting compassionate employment is thus to enable the family to tide over the sudden crisis.
Referring to State of Himachal Pradesh vs. Shashi Kumar reported in (2019) 3 SCC 653, Govind Prakash Verma vs. LIC reported in (2005) 10 SCC 289, the bench observed:
10. Thus as per the law laid down by this court in the aforesaid decisions, compassionate appointment is an exception to the 16 general rule of appointment in the public services and is in favour of the dependents of a deceased dying in harness and leaving his family in penury and without any means of livelihood, and in such cases, out of pure humanitarian consideration taking into consideration the fact that unless some source of livelihood is provided, the family would not be able to make both ends meet, a provision is made in the rules to provide gainful employment to one of the dependants of the deceased who may be eligible for such employment. The whole object of granting compassionate employment is thus to enable the family to tide over the sudden crisis. The object is not to give such family a post much less a post held by the deceased.

Punjab and Haryana High Court recently permitted an Overseas Indian citizen, booked for offences of Cheating and Criminal breach of trust by the Reawri Police, to visit the United States of America for a family reunion.
The bench comprising  Justice Vikas Bahl held that the petitioner has a fundamental right to travel abroad, which can be regulated by imposing certain conditions on him. It observed that the Court is required to "draw a balance" between the right of the petitioner to travel abroad on one hand and the right of the prosecution on another.
 "This Court is required to draw a balance between the right of the petitioner to travel abroad and also the right of the prosecution to duly prosecute the petitioner so as to prevent him from evading the trial. From a perusal of the various judgments passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as well as this Court, it is clear that paramount consideration is given to the conditions imposed upon the persons who have been granted the permission to go abroad, so as to ensure that they do not flee from justice."
 The case came up as a result of an order passed by the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Rewari and Sessions Judge, Rewari, respectively whereby an application to release the passport of the petitioner and grant of permission to visit the United States of America was dismissed. The criminal revision filed against the said order was also dismissed. Therefore, the petitioner approached the High Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for setting aside both the orders.
 The undisputed facts of the case are that the petitioner, one of the directors in the board of directors of a company was facing trial under Sections 420/406/120-B/34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 wherein the passport of the petitioner was confiscated.
 The court after hearing both the parties came to the conclusion that the petitioner has a fundamental right to travel abroad because the allegations in the present case are not such as to disentitle the petitioner to travel abroad. 
 Moving further to another issue that the period for which petitioner had initially sought permission to travel abroad has lapsed the court held that although the period has lapsed the cause still exists.
 In the present case, the primary plea raised by the petitioner is to meet his wife and son who are residing in the USA. The said cause was existing at the time of filing of the application at the first stage, at the time of arguments in the revision petition, as well as in the present petition. The cause thus survives. Moreover, the petitioner cannot be deprived of his right to travel abroad and meet his family members, merely on account of the fact that the period for which he had initially sought the said permission, has lapsed. In the present case, the visit was not for a specific function/event, upon the finishing of which, the cause would cease to survive.
 Court held that right to travel abroad is very much a fundamental right, but the said right is to be regulated by imposing suitable conditions for securing the petitioner's presence during the trial. It is also open to this Court while exercising its powers under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to consider any additional/ancillary plea in order to grant permission to the petitioner to travel abroad.
 In the present case, the primary ground for opposing the application for permission to go abroad is that the petitioner would not come back to India, in case permission is granted to go abroad. On this aspect, it has been highlighted that the petitioner is a permanent resident of the U.S. since 02.04.2011 and he does not have any immovable property in India. His family also lives in the USA. The company in which the petitioner was on the Board of Directors, is one of the accused in the complaints under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881.
 This Court is required to draw a balance between the right of the petitioner to travel abroad and also the right of the prosecution to duly prosecute the petitioner so as to prevent him from evading the trial. From a perusal of the various judgments passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as well as this Court, it is clear that paramount consideration is given to the conditions imposed upon the persons who have been granted the permission to go abroad, so as to ensure that they do not flee from justice.
 Therefore, keeping in view the facts and circumstances the petitioner is allowed to go abroad for a period of one month subject to certain conditions.

 The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has sternly deprecated the practice of importing officers from Govt departments to Corporations for such being in contravention of the Rules and hence illegal in nature. 
 The bench comprising Chief Justice Pankaj Mithal and Justice Wasim Sadiq Nargal was hearing an appeal filed by J&K State Road Transport Corporation (JKSRTC) challenging a Single bench order whereby Respondents (employees) were held to be entitled to promotion as Deputy General Manager in the Corporation with effect from February 11, 2013 and as General Manager with effect from February 11, 2018 with all consequential service benefits.
 Further, the Single Judge had also directed the Corporation to consider the case of Respondent-petitioner in the light of the observations made in the judgment and pass appropriate orders of substantive promotion of the petitioner.
 Background :
 The case of the petitioner before the Writ Court was that while he was representing for his confirmation in the post of DGM and consequent promotion to the post of General Manager, the Corporation vide communication dated November 26, 2015 had requested the Administrative Department for appointment of Abdul Hamid Wani, Drilling Engineer in the Geology and Mining Department as General Manager on deputation.
 The Respondent-petitioner had accordingly challenged the said communication and sought directions upon the corporation for confirming his promotion as DGM from the date when he was eligible and was assigned the charge of the post with all consequential benefits. Petitioner also sought relief for further promotion to the post of GM with effect from 28th July 2012, in conformity with the Regulations of 2013. 
The writ court after hearing both the sides had held the Respondent-petitioner entitled for promotion as Deputy General Manager w.e.f. 11.02.2013 and as General Manager w.e.f. 11.02.2018 with all consequential service benefits. Writ court further directed the Appellants-respondents to consider the case of petitioner in the light of observations made and pass appropriate orders of substantive promotion of the petitioner as Deputy General Manager (Main) and General Manager respectively w.e.f. the dates indicated above and release all consequential benefits, if any, in his favour within a period of two months from the date copy of this judgment. 
 Arguments:
 The appellants in their plea argued that the directions had been passed by the Single Judge on the basis of presumption of promotion of respondent no.1 to the post of DGM as on 11th February 2013 and completion of five years' experience in the said post as a matter of requirement of promotion to the post of GM. The appellant further submitted that the finding has been recorded by Single Judge without taking into consideration the availability of post of GM was required to be filled up by selection amongst other eligible candidates and, thus, the direction by Single Judge, which is based on presumptions and assumptions could not sustain the test of law and was liable to be set-aside.
 The respondents Contesting the plea argued that the respondent on the date of promulgation of the Regulations of 2013, was having more than seven years' experience as Works Manager and was thus entitled to be promoted as DGM, which post he was holding in incharge capacity since 28th July 2007 and therefore the Single bench had rightly ruled in his favour and as such need not attract any interference by the Division bench. 
 Observations: 
 The Division Bench while adjudicating upon the matter observed that the Corporation is empowered to lay down criteria for promotion and all the promotions shall be made on the ground of merit, ability, performance, besides good report and the seniority is to be considered only when the merit and ability is approximately equal. 
 "Regulation 12 of the Regulations of 2013 in categoric terms provides that all the posts are to be filled up by promotion on the basis of recommendations of the designated promotion committee of the Corporation based on merit, suitability and seniority. Thus, merit, suitability and seniority is yet to be assessed by the committee and without having the opinion of the committee, the judgment impugned to the extent of holding petitioner entitled to promotion as DGM and GM retrospectively is in contravention to the provisions of law", Justice Nargal for the bench further observed.
 Pointing towards the recruitment rules in vogue, which reveal that the post of DGM and GM can be filled up 100% by promotion by way of selection from the feeding category with requisite experience, the bench observed that Rules nowhere provide that the outsiders can be brought in by way of "deputation" infringing fundamental right of persons, who are born on the establishment of the Corporation and have preferential right of being considered for promotion. 
 "To bring the officers from outside by way of deputation to the Corporation can be only in the eventuality if no suitable person is found eligible in the Corporation after assessing their merit, eligibility and suitability", Justice Nargal observed. 
 Evaluating the single bench judgement on the touchstone of established legal principles the bench observed that since the direction passed by the Single Judge with regard to entitlement of petitioner for promotion to the post of DGM (Maintenance) in Corporation is premature as the issue in question was pending adjudication before the competent authority and hence merits being set-aside, the extent of holding petitioner entitled for promotion. 
 "We direct the Corporation to place the petitioner at an appropriate place in the seniority list once the decision is taken by competent authority with regard to his eligibility, merit coupled with seniority for the post of DGM and subsequently for the post of GM (if he is entitled)", concluded the bench.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that the power of the High Court in granting a writ of Habeas Corpus in child custody matters may be invoked only in cases where the detention of a minor is by a person, who is not entitled to his/her legal custody.In view of this, the Bench of Justice Raj Beer Singh dismissed a Habeas plea filed by the mother of a 5-year-old girl seeking minor's custody...
The Allahabad High Court has observed that the power of the High Court in granting a writ of Habeas Corpus in child custody matters may be invoked only in cases where the detention of a minor is by a person, who is not entitled to his/her legal custody.
In view of this, the Bench of Justice Raj Beer Singh dismissed a Habeas plea filed by the mother of a 5-year-old girl seeking minor's custody from her father (her husband) as the Court noted that the appropriate remedy in such matters would lie under the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 or Guardians and Wards Act, 1890.
The case in brief 
Allegedly, Petitioner No.2 (Mother of the child) was being harassed by her husband and other private respondents, and in September 20202 she was driven out from the matrimonial home and her minor girl (corpus) was snatched by the private respondents. 
Thereafter, she approached the High Court with her habeas plea submitting that since respondent no. 4 (Her Husband) is not treating the minor well and that she is under illegal detention of the respondents, therefore, she sought the minor's presence before the Court.
Court's order
Referring to several rulings of the Apex Court, the Court, at the outset, said that a habeas plea would be maintainable in child custody matters where detention by parents or others is found to be illegal and without any authority of law.
However, with regard to the facts of the case, the Court noted that the private respondents are none other than the biological father and grandparents of the minor child and therefore, it can not be said that the custody of the child with private respondents is unlawful.
Further, stressing that the proceedings in the of habeas corpus may not be used to examine the question of the custody of a child, the Court remarks thus:
"In an application seeking a writ of habeas corpus for custody of minor child, as is the case herein, the principal consideration for the court would be to ascertain whether the custody of the child can be said to be unlawful and illegal and whether his/her welfare requires that the present custody should be changed and the child should be handed over in the care and custody of someone else."
Consequently, noting that a petition under Section 13-B Hindu Marriage Act has already been filed in the court for divorces, the Court observed that the matter relating to custody of the child during the pendency of the proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 HMA is governed in terms of the provisions contained under Section 26 thereof. 
"Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 provides for custody of children and declares that in any proceeding under the said Act, the Court could make, from time to time, such interim orders as it might deem just and proper with respect to custody, maintenance and education of minor children, consistently with their wishes, wherever possible," the Court added.
Lastly, dismissing the plea, the court averred that in a writ court, where rights are determined on the basis of affidavits and that in a case where the court is of a view that a detailed inquiry would be required, it may decline to exercise the extraordinary jurisdiction and direct the parties to approach the appropriate forums.

Underscoring the importance of quashing domestic violence cases once parties arrive at a settlement, even though they are categorized as non-compoundable offence, the Bombay High Court observed it would be "hazardous" to force a couple to litigate when they want to live happily.
 "The interest of justice is to foster and cement the bondage of togetherness of the nucleus of the society, that is the family. It will be hazardous to the society to force the parties to litigate over an issue in such matters especially when the parties have come to a compromise and they want to live a happy life."
 A bench of Justices Vibha Kankanwadi and Rajesh Patil noted that refusing to quash disputes despite amicable settlements, would be a "dis-service to the society for the protection of which the courts exits."
 "No doubt the matrimonial offences are a slur on our society and the legislature in its wisdom thought it proper to curb the menace of such type of matrimonial disputes with conviction but this does not mean that the interest of justice, which is supreme of all the laws and for which the courts exits to be also sacrificed at the alter of technicalities."
 Observing thus, the bench quashed a domestic violence (498A) case filed by the wife against her husband and his family members on a criminal application filed by the latter under section 482 of the CrPC. 
 Live Law recently reported an order wherein a coordinate bench of the HC asked the Union to consider allowing the Maharashtra bill to make 489A of the IPC a compoundable offence. Compoundable offences are those which can be settled with the permission of the local court. However, non-compoundable offences are those that cannot be settled and would require the assent of the HC. 
 In the case at hand, the husband and his parents were booked under sections Sections 498A, 323, 504 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code by the Vajirabad Police Station in Nanded in 2020. The present FIR was registered soon after the husband filed for restitution of conjugal rights. 
 The couple was married in 2017 and had one son from their marriage. Their counsel submitted that the parties had arrived at a compromise and there was no use of dragging them to court for completion of formalities of the case when they wanted to move on and lead a happy life. 
 The division bench agreed with the counsel's submissions and quashed the proceedings accordingly.

"Merely granting protection for long time would not be a ground to extend the benefit of anticipatory bail to the accused, when the applicant is otherwise disentitled for anticipatory bail", the Gujarat High Court has held.

"Merely granting protection for long time would not be a ground to extend the benefit of anticipatory bail to the accused, when the applicant is otherwise disentitled for anticipatory bail", the Gujarat High Court has held. 
Justice Ilesh J. Vora was hearing an application under Section 438 of CrPC seeking pre-arrest bail in connection with an FIR for offences under Sections 307, 397, 452, 324, 323, 143, 147, 148, 504 and 506(2) of IPC.
 The Applicant, along with seven persons, armed with washbasin pipe, having metal bolt, allegedly assaulted the victim Anand and caused severe head injuries and looted cash of about INR 30,000. When the first informant tried to intervene, the Applicant threatened that if they filed an FIR, there would be dire consequences. The entire incident was captured on CCTV footage. 
 Thereafter, the Applicant moved an anticipatory bail which was rejected by the Sessions Court stating that the alleged offence was prima facie serious and that custodial investigation was necessary. 
The Applicant contended that the impugned FIR was a counter blast to the complaint filed by the Applicant which was not registered by the police. Further, the victim had provoked the attack and that the Applicant had not done anything since the last two years, while he was protected by the Court. 
The Applicant further claimed that is rooted in the society and had no adverse antecedents. Meanwhile, the Applicant had cooperated with the investigation. A case registered against the Applicant with another police station was quashed by the High Court while a case registered with Gandhinagar police station had been stayed by the High Court in quashing proceedings.
 Per contra, the Complainant urged that anticipatory bail could only be granted in exceptional circumstances where the Court was of prima facie view that the Applicant was roped in false charges. Here, the Applicant was said to be having political influence, could tamper with evidence and significantly, he had disclosed his identity based on the CCTV footage. The Respondent-State concurred with these arguments.
 Noting the Supreme Court's opinion in P Chidambaram vs Directorate of Enforcement [2019 (9) SCC 24] wherein it was observed, "ordinarily, arrest is a part of procedure of investigation to secure not only the presence of the accused, but several other purposes. Power under Section 438 is an extraordinary power and same has to be exercised sparingly. The privilege of pre-arrest bail should be granted only in exceptional cases. The judicial discretion conferred upon the Court has to be properly exercised after application of mind as to the nature and gravity of accusation; possibility of fleeing from justice and other factors to decide whether it is a fit case for grant of anticipatory bail or not", the Bench refused to grant anticipatory bail to the Applicant.
 Per the Bench, the whole incident was captured on CCTV footage wherein the Applicant's presence was confirmed. The victim was stripped by the accused and that another accused was yet to be identified for which the investigation was still going on. 
The Court noted that there were prior FIRs against two offences against the Applicant and the contention that no purpose would be served by sending him to jail was rejected. Accordingly, the Application was rejected.

The Allahabad High Court recently denied bail to a man who allegedly shared intimate pictures of his girlfriend with her family members as it noted that this was an exclusive case of betrayal of the faith of the victim by the applicant.
The Bench of Justice Rahul Chaturvedi also observed that while the victim permitted the accused to have those photographs under certain confidence and understanding, the applicant/accused had backstabbed her and betrayed her to its core.
The case in brief
As per the FIR lodged against the bail applicant by the victim-girl, they both came into contact with each other through the Facebook platform, and thereafter, they came into a relationship. Further, she has alleged that after crossing all the limits of decency and chivalry, the applicant-accused outraged her modesty.
Thereafter, allegedly he took certain intimate "videos and pictures" in intimate condition, and thereafter, he started exploiting her. He kept on transgressing his limits quite often and then started sending lascivious and objectionable WhatsApp chats with her, just to threaten and to feel her embarrassed and uneasy.
Further, in February 2021, when she was going to her room, en route she was intercepted by the applicant, thereafter, he misbehaved with her and extended all sorts of threats, and hurled filthy abuses at her.
In her 164 Cr.P.C. statement, the girl stated that after taking her pictures, the bail applicant accused started blackmailing her and threatened her to send those videos and photos to her family members and would make it viral. 
Horrified by this, she started dancing to his tune, and eventually, the accused sent all those photos to her family members and also threatened to make those pics viral in public.
The applicant was thereafter arrested and is behind the bars since August 2021 in connection with a case against him under sections 376, 504, 506, 507, 354, 354(Kha) of IPC and Section 67 of the I.T. Act.
Court's observations 
Taking into account all the facts and material on record, the Court noted that the acts of the bail applicant indicated his selfish and short-sighted approach and he, in order to establish the consensual relationship, mercilessly sacrificed the victim's dignity and honor on the road.
Regarding the act of sharing the snaps and calling accused, the most gender insensitive and crooked person, the Court remarked thus:
"She has permitted to have those photographs under certain confidence and understanding with the applicant but the applicant now backstabbed her and betrayed her to its core, just to establish his point. Naturally, the victim has to pay its heavy price in the future. Under these circumstances, the applicant cannot be permitted to roam around freely, without paying the price of this sin. In the nutshell, this is an exclusive case of betrayal of the faith of the victim by the applicant. In her 164 Cr.P.C. statement, she clearly states that the applicant has forwarded those intimate photographs to her family members and the author of those pics are none other than the applicant alone."
After assessing the material on record, the Court observed that the applicant did not deserve any sympathy, therefore, keeping in view that it is the applicant who exploited his relationship for his joy, thereafter, winning the victim's confidence, succeeded in getting those intimate photographs and lastly started blackmailing her, the Court denied him bail.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court, Gwalior Bench recently set aside bail of a man, accused of committing unnatural sex with his wife.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court, Gwalior Bench recently set aside bail of a man, accused of committing unnatural sex with his wife. 
The Court observed that the ground taken by the lower court while granting anticipatory bail to the accused/husband that there was delay in disclosure of offence under Section 377 IPC on the part of the Applicant/wife was unwarranted and made in a casual manner without appreciating the surrounding circumstances.
Deciding the application for cancellation of bail, Justice G.S. Ahluwalia observed-
"This Court cannot lose sight of the fact that a wife is slow in rushing to the police station for making complaint of each and every act of harassment or maltreatment. The first intention of the wife is to save her married life and to give sufficient time to her in-laws as well as her husband, so that the situation may improve. The patience shown by the wife should not be treated as a weakness or an attempt to create a false story. Thus, if the applicant kept quiet for one year and did not disclose to her parents about the unnatural sex committed by the applicant, then it cannot be said that her conduct of keeping mum was nothing but an attempt to explain the delay."
As per the Prosecution story, the Applicant/wife was being physically and mentally harassed by her husband/accused and her in-laws for dowry. However, in order to save the pride of her parents, she silently tolerated the harassment without sharing her agony with her parents. In addition to that, her husband was regularly asking her for indulging in unnatural sex. When the Applicant objected to it, the accused threatened to kill her. She was eventually ousted from her matrimonial home by her in-laws but she waited for 10 months before lodging the FIR in the hope of saving her marriage. Finally, she filed the FIR against her husband for offences punishable under Section 3,4 Dowry Prohibition Act and under Section 498-A, 323, 377, 506 IPC.
The husband had moved an application for anticipatory bail before the lower court and his application was allowed. Aggrieved with the said order, the Applicant/wife moved the Court for cancellation of bail of the accused under Section 439(2) CrPC.
The Applicant submitted before the Court that the ground taken by the lower court while granting anticipatory bail that there was a delay in filing the FIR as she got the offences registered 10 months after leaving her matrimonial home and 13 months after the alleged unnatural sex committed upon her, was without consideration of material facts. She argued that the Court failed to acknowledge that her first priority was to save her marriage. She asserted that if a girl is trying hard to save her married life, then such conduct cannot be taken to her discredit for disbelieving the allegations of unnatural sex being delayed in nature. She further submitted that unless and until an allegation is barred by limitation, the lower court should not have given any finding with regard to the delayed allegations at the stage of grant of bail. She also contended that the lower court committed material irregularity by observing that the custodial interrogation of her husband was not required. Therefore, she prayed the Court that the bail of her husband be cancelled.
Per contra, the husband/accused argued that the criteria for cancellation of bail is completely different from the criteria for grant of bail. He added that there was no allegation that after the anticipatory bail was granted, he misused the liberty or had not cooperated with the investigation.
Examining the submissions of the parties and documents on record, the Court noted that there were specific allegations of demand of dowry and physical and mental harassment on account of non-fulfillment of said demand-
Even otherwise, there is specific allegation in the FIR that this act of committing unnatural sex by her husband was disclosed by the applicant to her parents-in-laws, therefore, by no stretch of imagination it can be said that the applicant kept quiet about the unnatural sex committed by the respondent no.1. Further in the light of judgment passed by Supreme Court in the case of Rupali Devi vs. State of U.P. reported in (2019) 5 SCC 384, compelling a married woman to live in her parental home on account of non-fulfillment of demand of dowry is also a cruelty.
The Court, thus, noted that the lower court committed material illegality while passing the impugned order-
Looking to the seriousness of the allegations of demand of dowry as well as of committing unnatural sex with the applicant, this Court is of the considered opinion that the Court below committed a material illegality by granting anticipatory bail to the respondent no.1. Accordingly, the order dated 5/10/2021 passed by First Additional Sessions Judge, Ganj Basoda, District Vidisha in Bail Application No.407/2021 is hereby set aside.
With the aforesaid observations, the Court allowed the application and further directed the husband/accused to surrender before the police authorities.

The Supreme Court, while noting the plight of a physically disabled employee, stated that disabled employees should not be forced to forfeit seniority for choosing posting place as per a beneficial circular. The circular in question was issued by the Finance Department of the Rajasthan Government. It directed the appointing authorities to consider the posting of persons with disabilities at or near the place for which they opt at the time of appointment. 
A bench comprising Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice JK Maheshwari opined that while the physically disabled appellant was appointed in 1993, which was before the Circular was passed in 2000, having regard to the object of issuance of the Circular, which was to enable handicapped employees to opt for posting at a convenient place, the benefit of the circular would be extended even to those candidates who were appointed before issuance of the Circular.
Briefly, the facts of the case are that the appellant, a handicapped candidate of the "OBC" category, was selected as Senior Teacher under the Education Department of the Government of Rajasthan, Deeplana in Hanumangarh, District Bikaner, through a direct competitive examination. However, Deeplana, where the Appellant was posted was located at a distance of about 550 kms away from Behror, the place of residence of the Appellant in Alwar District. As per a Circular issued by the Finance Department of the Rajasthan Government, all appointing authorities were directed to consider the appointment/posting of persons with disabilities at or near the place for which they opt at the time of appointment/posting. After the issuance of Circular, the appellant made a representation to be transferred to his home district Alwar, considering his physical disability.
Accordingly, the Deputy Director of Education (Secondary) transferred the Appellant to Alwar. However, the transfer to his home district entailed a down-gradation in his seniority. In 2016, the Appellant was promoted to the post of Junior Lecturer and posted at the Government Aadarsh Senior Secondary School at Nangalkhodia, Behror, Alwar. In 2017, the temporary eligibility list of qualified teachers for promotion to the post of Head Master was published and the name of the Appellant did not feature in the list as his name had been deleted from the the State and Divisional level seniority list in 2007 and as a result, had been changed in the seniority list from 870 to 1318.
The Appellant filed a Writ Petition before the Single Judge of the Jaipur Bench of the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan, challenging the downgrading of his seniority. However, the same was dismissed. Thereafter, he appealed to the Division Bench, which also dismissed his appeal based on Explanation to Sub-Rule (10) of Rule 29 of the Rajasthan Educational Subordinate Services Rules, 1971 (the Explanation). As per the said Explanation, when an employee is transferred to a district based on his request, he should be placed below the junior most person in the district.
Here, the court opined that the actions of the Respondent-Authorities ex facie violated Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. On a perusal of the Explanation, the court stated that the said explanation applied to employees in general to discourage transfers on request and that it affects only the district-wise seniority. The Explanation will not alter state level seniority.
The court, acknowledged that the Appellant was appointed in 1993, long before the Circular for appointment/posting of persons with disability at or near the place of their choice was issued in 2000. However, it stated that having regard to the object of issuance of the Circular, which was to enable handicapped employees to opt for posting at a convenient place, the benefit of the circular had to be extended even to those candidates appointed before issuance of the Circular.
Accordingly, the court noted that exclusion of the benefit of the Circular to handicapped employees already in employment at the time of its issuance, would violate the fundamental right of those employees to equality under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.
Fundamental rights of disabled persons
While opining upon the marginalisation of people with disabilities, the court highlighted that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (UNCRPD), which is aimed at protecting the human rights and dignity of persons with disability, was adopted to ensure inherent dignity and individual autonomy of persons with disability. The court underscored that the right of nondiscrimination under the UNCRPD, would include reasonable accommodation and/or concessions for full and effective participation and inclusion in society. Since UNCRPD had been ratified by India, the State was thus obliged to give effect to the UNCRPD. 
The court further stated that–
"Furthermore, the disabled are entitled to the fundamental right of equality enshrined in Articles 14 to 16 of the Constitution of India, the fundamental freedoms guaranteed under Article 19 including the right to carry out any occupation, profession, the right to life under Article 21, which has now been interpreted to mean the right to live with dignity, which has to be interpreted liberally in relation to the disabled."
While noting that one of the hindrances/disadvantages faced by the physically disabled persons was the inability to move freely and easily, the court held that the object of the Circular issued for posting disabled persons to places of their choice was to enable the physically disabled to be posted at a place where assistance may readily be available. Further, the distance from the residence was s relevant consideration to avoid commuting long distances. The court stated that–
"The benefit which has been given to the disabled through the Circular/Government Order cannot be taken away by subjecting the exercise of the right to avail of the benefit on such terms and conditions, as would render the benefit otiose...Both the Single Bench as also the Division Bench of the High Court have overlooked the scope and ambit of the Explanation which has no application in the State to seniority. In our view, the High Court should have been more sensitive and empathetic to the plight of a physically disabled...The High Court failed to appreciate that treatment of unequals as equals ignoring their special needs violates Article 14 of the Constitution."
Accordingly, the Respondents were directed to restore the seniority of the Appellant in the State to the original position, taking into account the service rendered by him in Hanumangarh.
Mr.Rahul Shyam Bhandari, AOR and Mr. Akash Sinha, Adv. appeared for the appellant. Mr. Ashish Kumar, AAG, Mr. Sushil Kumar Singh, Adv., Mr. Jordan R., Adv. Mr. Sandeep Kumar Jha, AOR appeared for the State.
CASE TITLE: NET RAM YADAV v. THE STATE OF RAJASTHAN & ORS. 
Summary - A person appointed under quota for Persons With Disabilities was allowed to choose his place of posting as per a beneficial circular issued by the Government- Later, in the state seniority list, his seniority was downgraded for having opted for transfer - The State relied on a provision in the service rules as per which a person will choose seniority within a district on transfer as per his request - The Court held that provision cannot alter state wise seniority - Also, the Court held that the benefit given to disabled persons as per the circular cannot be rendered otiose by imposing conditions.
Rights of Persons With Disabilities Act 2016 - The marginalization of the disabled/handicapped is a human rights issue, which has been the subject matter of deliberations and discussion all over the world. There is increasing global concern to ensure that the disabled are not sidelined on account of their disability (Para 26)
Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 - Furthermore, the disabled are entitled to the fundamental right of equality enshrined in Articles 14 to 16 of the Constitution of India, the fundamental freedoms guaranteed under Article 19 including the right to carry out any occupation, profession, the right to life under Article 21, which has now been interpreted to mean the right to live with dignity, which has to be interpreted liberally in relation to the disabled (Para 30
Rights of Persosn with Disabilties Act 2016 -One of the hindrances/disadvantages faced by the physically disabled persons is the inability to move freely and easily. In consideration of the obstacles encountered by persons with disabilities, the State has issued the said notification/circular dated 20th July 2000 for posting disabled persons to places of their choice, to the extent feasible. The object of this benefit to the physically disabled is to, inter alia, enable the physically disabled to be posted at a place where assistance may readily be available. The distance from the residence may be a relevant consideration to avoid commuting long distances. The benefit which has been given to the disabled through the Circular/Government Order cannot be taken away by subjecting the exercise of the right to avail of the benefit on such terms and conditions, as would render the benefit otiose (Para 31)

The Allahabad High Court has observed that in the event of the death of the victim, the statement made by her/his to any living person becomes relevant and admissible in evidence under Section 32 (1) of the Indian Evidence Act if the same relates to cause of her/his death.
 The bench of Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Umesh Chandra Sharma further clarified that under Indian Law, it is not necessary that the person who made any declaration was actually expecting an assault that would kill him
 With this, the bench upheld the sentence of life imprisonment awarded to 3 accused who kidnapped and murdered 2 boys, who were called by them to Agra on the pretext of providing them jobs.
 From a perusal of the facts and the evidence brought in the case, the Court held that it was established by the prosecution that the accused had mens-rea to kidnap and abduct the deceased persons for obtaining a ransom, and for this purpose, first of all, they prepared a plan and in furtherance of the plan, the accused Pawan Mishra called the boys for employment purposes and when they came to Agra they were killed and thereafter buried.
 The case in brief
 Accused Pawan Mishra asked the First Informant (his uncle) to send his nephew/deceased (Amar @ Jeevan Sharma) to Agra where he would be provided with a Job. The deceased went to Agra with his friend (Victor) on June 12, 2005. After 2-3 days, Amar informed the informant on the phone that no arrangement for a job/service was there. Upon knowing this, the first informant had asked him to return.
 Now, on June 15, 2005, Pawan Mishra (accused) informed the informant that the boys had been sent back by train, however, when the boys did not reach on June 16, 2005, then the informant contacted Mishra (Accused) on his mobile phone and that is when he told him that he had abducted the boys and that they would be only returned once the ransom is paid. 
 Pursuant to the registration of the FIR, the accused was arrested and he confessed that since he was in the need of money for repurchasing his paternal house, which was sold away earlier by his uncle, he hatched a plan to ask for ransom from the first informant after kidnapping Amar and his friend Victor.
 On his pointing, two other accused persons Dinesh Sahu and Kripal Sahu were also arrested and the three accused, thereafter, took the police to the place of occurrence where the dead bodies of the deceased persons were recovered along with the Shovels/Hoes, which were used in digging and burying the two dead bodies; Jeevan and Victor.
 Following the trial, the accused were sentenced to life imprisonment after they were found guilty of committing the offence under sections 302, 364A, and 201 IPC. Challenging the judgment, all three accused moved to the High Court.
 Court's observations
 At the outset, the Court rejected the argument of the counsel for the defence that the dead bodies were not identified. Essentially, the defence counsel argued that since the dead bodies were in such a state that no person could have recognized them and it was not proved beyond reasonable doubt that these two dead bodies were of Amar @ Jeewan Sharma and Victor @ Potan
 The Court observed that the dead bodies were recovered upon the pointing of accused persons, especially on the pointing of the accused Pawan Mishra, who had called the deceased to Agra for giving them employment.
 The Court also noted that during the cross-examination, no question was raised with regard to the identity of the dead bodies, therefore, this argument can't be raised in the appeal.
 Further, the Court observed that the conversation between the informant and the deceased (Jeevan alias Amar Sharma) with regard to their reaching Agra for employment and with regard to the fact that the latter was received by the accused Pawan Mishra, and that both the deceased boys stayed in the hotel arranged by the accused and that the accused demanded of ransom everything is part of the same transaction and thus, the same would be relevant and admissible in evidence under Section 6 of The Indian Evidence Act.
 The Court further opined that the conversation of the deceased Jeevan alias Amar to the informant while coming from Devghar and also from Agra to the informant at Devghar is also relevant and admissible in evidence under Section 32 of the Indian Evidence Act.
 In this regard, the Court was of the view that the information given by the deceased persons before their death to the informant was admissible in evidence against the accused persons under Section 32 (1) of the Indian Evidence Act as the same would be termed as their dying declaration and it was immaterial that they were not under an expectation of death when they made such statements to the informant.
 The Court further noted that since it was established that deceased persons were in the company of all the three accused persons, therefore, it was the burden of all of them to discharge their burden of proof under section 106 of The Indian Evidence Act, however, they failed to give any explanation of the death of the deceased persons.
 Taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the case and perusing the evidence on record, the Court did not find any illegality with the Court's order as it remarked thus:
 "The course of this case began on 11.6.2005 when the deceased commenced their journey and reached Agra on 12.6.2005. Thereafter they ended in the hands of accused persons. In between the chain of all the facts and evidence have been fully connected and established by the prosecution. The chain of circumstantial evidence is intact and established without breaking. Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that by proving motive, Mens-rea, demand of ransom and lastly recovery of the dead bodies from the person who had demanded ransom, the prosecution has successfully proved the case beyond all reasonable doubt against the accused persons. It is established that except the accused persons none else would have committed the murder and have buried both the deceased persons under the earth at the place of occurrence. Therefore, we find no infirmity in the appreciation of evidence in connection with conclusion drawn by the trial court."

The Gujarat High Court bench of Justice Sonia Gokani and Justice Rajendra M. Saraen, while invalidating the reassessment initiated by the DRI, held that the officer who did the assessment could only undertake reassessment.
 The petitioner/assessee is a private limited company and is in the business of trading and manufacturing goods like inkjet printers, laser printers, and parts as well as accessories for printers. The petitioner has been importing goods like Continuous Inkjet Printers (CIJ Printers), Laser Marking Machines, parts and accessories for CIJ Printers, and other such goods from foreign countries. They are being imported from China during the period from 2014 to 2021.
 The assessee has challenged the action of the respondent/department which has initiated the proceedings and conducted an inquiry/investigation into the imports made by the petitioner at various Customs Stations.
 The petitioner submitted that the consignments which had been allowed to be cleared for home consumption had been sold by the petitioner to their customers, as the petitioner was engaged in a trading business. The sales have been affected by following due procedure, and the appropriate taxes leviable on such trading business have also been paid.
 The office of DRI, Chennai Zonal Unit, came across the imports made by the petitioner and the department initiated an investigation against the petitioner. The DRI Officers formed a belief that the goods imported by the petitioner were classifiable under CTH 84433910, 84433990, and 84439960 and the rate of custom duties on the goods under these classifications was higher than the rates applicable to the classifications declared by the petitioner. 
 According to the DRI Officers, the petitioner had misclassified the CIJ Printers, parts of CIJ Printers, and Laser Marking Machines for availing of a lower rate of duty or full exemption and, on that notion, the investigation was conducted by the department at all the customs stations. The representative of the petitioner's Customs House Agent was also called at the Chennai Zonal Office of DRI and the statements were recorded by the DRI Officers in respect of the imports of the goods imported by the petitioner.
 It was alleged that during the investigation, the petitioner was forced and pressured to make monetary deposits towards the customs duties allegedly short paid on the imported goods. The petitioner was left with no alternative and has deposited Rs. 50 lakhs during the investigation. 
 As a result of an inquiry and investigation by the Additional Director General, DRI, Chennai, it has issued a Show Cause Notice invoking the provisions of Section 28(4) of the Customs Act. The Additional Director General, DRI, Chennai, has proposed to reassess transactions of imports made by the petitioner at various customs stations and differential custom duties were also proposed to be demanded and recovered from the petitioner for the goods imported at customs stations, alleging that they had misclassified the imported goods and paid a reduced rate of duty or availed exemption from customs duties by resorting to the wrong classification for the goods in question.
 The petitioner contended that the entire proceedings of the issuance of the show cause notice under Section 28 of the Customs Act were invalid and without authority of law since the DRI officer was not the proper officer of Customs and even the action taken was liable to be set aside when the proceedings itself were by a DRI officer.
 The petitioner relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of M/s. Canon India Pvt. Ltd. in which it was held that the statute conferred the power to perform an act on different officers, and when those officers belong to different departments, they cannot exercise their powers under the case. When one officer exercises his powers of assessment, the power to order reassessment must be exercised by the same officer or his successor officer and not by any officer in any department designated to be an officer of the same rank.
 The court noted that while analysing Section 28A (4) of the Customs Act, the Apex Court held that the provision must be construed as conferring the power of review on the same officer or his successor who has been assigned the function of assessment. After extensive analysis, the Court held that the entire proceeding initiated by the Additional Director General of DRI by issuing show cause notices in all the matters were invalid, without any authority of law and liable to be set aside, and accordingly, the ensuing demands have also been set aside.
 The court quashed the show cause notices issued in each case by the DRI on the basis of the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of M/s. Canon India.
 Case Title: Messrs Aztec Fluids And Machinery Pvt. Ltd. Versus UOI
 Dated: 01.04.2022
 Counsel For Petitioner: Advocate Paresh M.Dave 
 Counsel For Respondent: Advocate devang Vyas 

The Delhi High Court has upheld a circular stipulating that the city's district court employees can be allowed to visit a foreign country only during Summer Vacations, Winter Vacations, Public Holidays and in case of any exigency.
A single judge bench comprising of Justice V Kameswar Rao dismissed a plea challenging the order dated January 31, 2022 passed by the respondent, Office of the Principal District and Sessions Judge, whereby it had rejected the application of the petitioner, who held the post of Senior Personal Assistant in the Court of an Additional Sessions Judge at Rohini Courts.
 The said application sought grant of Earned Leave for a period of 30 days, by referring to the impugned circular dated August 4, 2018 which stipulated that a court staff can be allowed to visit a foreign country only during Summer Vacations, Winter Vacations, Public Holidays and in case of any exigency.
The wife of the petitioner was in the employment of the Ministry of External Affairs, posted in the Embassy of India, at Harare, Zimbabwe where she was residing with their daughter, aged 17 years. 
On September 13, 2021, the petitioner filed an application with the office of the respondent seeking grant of EL for a period of 30 days to visit his family in Zimbabwe, to provide assistance to his daughter for her admission to an educational institution. Vide order dated December 18, 2021, the application was rejected.
The challenge in the petition was thus to the circular dated August 04, 2018 and the order dated January 31, 2022 issued by the office of the respondent on the ground that the same were unconstitutional and null and void.
The Court noted that the request of the petitioner was rejected on three grounds; firstly, it did not show any satisfactory reason; secondly, there was a scarcity of staff and thirdly, he has already availed leaves of more than three years during the period 2017 to 2020 for travelling abroad.
On the contention that the impugned circular discriminates between those District Court employees who wish to travel abroad and those who wish to travel within India, the Court said thus:
"The plea is without merit, in view of the CCS (Leave) Rules on which reliance has been placed by the counsel for the petitioner himself, more specifically, Rule 7, which stipulates in no uncertain terms that leave cannot be claimed as a matter of right. The Rule, in fact contemplates when the exigencies of public service so require, leave of any kind may be refused or revoked by the authority competent to grant it. In other words, even a leave sought to travel within India can be denied/ revoked in the event of an exigency. Hence, there is no violation of Article 14 of Constitution of India, as alleged by the counsel."
On another argument that there was no intelligible differentia and reasonable nexus between the impugned circular and the object sought to be achieved, the Court said that the same was also without merit. 
"It is a conceded case that the petitioner is an employee of a District Court. The Courts, supported by the staff appointed, discharge an important public function of rendering justice to the people. It is to ensure that this important public function of rendering justice to litigants is unhindered, that the impugned circular is issued which contemplates that an employee working in a District Court can apply for permission to travel abroad only during summer vacations, winter vacations, public holidays and in case of any exigency."
"Further, objective behind the circular is, as travelling abroad, is always for a larger duration, (in this case the petitioner sought leave for thirty days) such visits must be undertaken during the summer, winter and public holidays. The exceptions to summer, winter and public holidays is, if there is an exigency (subject to the satisfaction of the competent authority), the employee can travel abroad," the Court observed.
It added that in any case, the underlying rule was that an employee cannot seek permission to go abroad by availing leaves, as a matter of right. 
"Clearly, there is an objective sought to be achieved by the impugned circular. Hence, this plea is rejected," it said. 
The Court said that the impugned circular had applicability to all the employees of all District Courts in Delhi. It also rejected the argument of the petitioner that there was no foundation in any of the Rules of 2012 and CCS (Leave) Rules, which permitted the respondent to impose any restriction on its employees to travel abroad. 
"I must state that the impugned circular does not restrict an employee having an exigency, seeking permission to travel abroad when it is not summer vacations, winter vacations or public holidays. The request of the petitioner for sanction of thirty days EL between March 21, 2022 to April 19, 2022 was denied vide the impugned order, as the request of the petitioner did not reflect satisfactory reasons inasmuch as he has sought the leave on the ground of helping his wife in admitting their daughter to a new school and meeting his family members. Furthermore, the establishment/court was undergoing a scarcity of staff and the petitioner had already availed leaves for more than three years during the period 2017-2020 for travelling abroad," the Court said. 
Finding no merits in the plea, the Court dismissed the same.

The Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) plea seeking a CBI probe and SIT inquiry against two government officers in the Public Works Department alleging that they had earned hundreds of crores by misuse of their position.
The bench of Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Justice Shree Prakash Singh observed that the petitioner had not disclosed his credentials and it appeared that he was acting at the instance of someone else.
Further, referring to the Apex Court's decision in the case of State of Uttranchal Vs. Balwant Singh Chaufal (2010) 3 SCC 402, the Court observed that frivolous vexatious petitions and petitions which seek to serve personal interest should not be entertained, rather such petitions should be dismissed at the very threshold.
Essentially, one Ratnesh Kumar had moved the High Court seeking a direction to the UP govt and others to conduct an SIT inquiry/CBI probe into the alleged corruption committed by two individual officers in the Public Works Department, namely, Sri V.K.Singh and Sri S.P. Saxena.
At the outset, the Court observed that the writ petition had been filed without any concrete or reliable evidence in respect of the assertions made by the petitioner and that the allegations were made merely on the basis of some departmental correspondence made by the departmental officers, that too, way back in the year 2007-2008.
Further, the Court noted that the petitioner had utterly failed to establish his credentials which is a mandatory condition (for the person filing a PIL) as per Rule (3-A) in Rule 1 of Chapter XXII of the Allahabad High Court Rules.
"What all has been stated by the petitioner is that he is a "public spirited citizen" and is involved in "so many activities" for public good and want that the rule of law should prevail in governance. As to how the petitioner has described himself to be a public spirited citizen and as to in what particular activities has he been engaged for public good, has not been disclosed by the petitioner."
Lastly, noting that the petitioner had relied upon certain other departmental correspondence made by the officers of the department, however, no other credible document or evidence had been enclosed in the petition so as to arrive at any conclusive or concrete finding about the alleged irregularities/corruption, the Court dismissed the PIL plea.

The Bombay High Court has upheld former Ranji player and former captain of under-19 Indian team Kiran Powar's removal from the Mumbai Cricket Association's Apex Council, and also upheld the bar on him from playing cricket for a year.
 The division bench of Justices SV Gangapurwala and RN Laddha passed the order in a petition filed by Powar, who challenged the decision of MCA's Ethics Officer after he was found guilty of "conflict of interest." 
 Powar is the brother of Ramesh Powar, coach of Indian Women's Cricket Team. 
 On December 28, 2021 (retd) Justice VK Tahilramani in her capacity as MCA's Ethics Officer found "conflict on interest" in two aspects based on a complaint by one Deepan Sunderlal Mistry. 
 First, soon after Powar's appointment as an Apex Council member, his brother was appointed as Head Coach for MCA; and second, Powar was on contract as cricket coach of the Goregaon Sports Club (GSC) while he was the Apex Council Member. GSC would participate in MCA's tournaments, therefore the conflict. 
 Before the High Court, Powar claimed he wasn't required to disclose any of the above. His counsel informed the High Court when the complaint was filed, Ramesh was no longer the coach of any Mumbai teams and even Powar was not a coach at GSC, therefore the conflict of interest ceased to exist.
 But Advocates A S Khandeparkar and Vikas Warerkar for MCA submitted that the Ethics Officer was empowered to pass the order under Rule 39(3) of the MCA constitution. The rules were part of Former Chief Justice of India (CJI) R M Lodha Committee recommendations on series of reforms in Indian Cricket Administration and confirmed by the Supreme Court in the BCCI case.
 The High Court noted that Powar was appointed to the Apex Council in October 2019. However, he failed to declare that his brother was appointed as a coach for MCA between 2017-18 and that his (brother's) name was under consideration. 
  "The Petitioner did not declare his conflict of interest and became the Apex Council Member. The Petitioner did not maintain the transparency as is held by the Ethics Officer cum Ombudsman," the High Court noted. 
 The disclosure should've been made under section 38(2) of MCA's constitution, the order states. Under section 38(1)(v) any person who occupies a position of influence must disclose where a friend, relative or close affiliate is in the zone of consideration.
 "…being an Apex Council member, a person would be in an influential position in matters of selection, therefore it cannot be said that the Ethics Officer's decision was perverse for HC to interfere," the bench observed. 
 "It cannot be said that the punishment imposed and / or the order passed is shockingly disproportionate for this court to intervene," it added and disposed of the plea. 
Case Title: Kiran Rajaram Powar v. Mumbai Cricket Association

The Gujarat High Court has recently granted anticipatory bail to a public servant employed in the Police force and his wife, in a case of dowry harassment initiated at the instance of their daughter in law.
Justice Nikhil S Kariel observed that merely because the accused father-in-law is in Police is no ground to deny him anticipatory bail and adequate conditions can be imposed to prevent tampering of evidence. In fact, the bench was of the view that the father-in-law being a public servant, there could not be any apprehension that he would flee from trial. 
The Bench also observed that though allegations of harassment were levelled, however, the accused father-in-law and mother-in-law "more or less were residing separately".
"It may have been that during the time when the applicant No.1, was facing proceedings under the Prevention of Corruption Act, that he may have lived with his son and her daughter-in-law, but at the same time the documents relied upon by the applicants which are not controverted by the complainant clearly reflect that the daughter of the complainant and her husband were staying independently."
The case was an upshot of the daughter-in-law going missing, leaving a suicide note behind in 2021. The applicants were accused of offences under Sections 498(A), 377, 323, 294(B), 506(2) and 114 of IPC and Sections 3 and 7 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.
The applicants averred that the daughter-in-law and their son last lived together in a property purchased in her name from 2018 onwards. Meanwhile, the father-in-law was working in the Gujarat Police force and was working across the state and therefore, had visited his son and family but had not lived with his daughter-in-law.
 Per contra, the Complainant (father of daughter-in-law) stated that even though his daughter and her husband were living independently, the in-laws were in the same building. He even complained of being threatened by the applicants. 
The State also resisted grant of anticipatory bail on the ground that a witness was present when the applicants threatened the complainant.
 The Bench noted that barring the instant Applicants and their son, all other accused in the case were on bail. The High Court also did not accord much importance to the statement of the witness at that stage and keeping in view the profile of the Applicant, granted anticipatory bail on a personal bond of Rs. 25,000.
 Case Title: PRATAPDAN SHAMALDAN GADHV v/s STATE OF GUJARAT
 Case No.: R/CR.MA/14585/2021

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently observed that the question whether a particular case is of exceptional nature or not to warrant action under Section 8(4) of Prevention of Money Laundering Act can be determined only by the appellate authority at the time of considering the merits of the appeal and not by a Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction.
 The observations were made by a bench comprising Chief Justice Ali Mohammad Magrey and Justice Sanjay Dhar while dismissing the pleas of Syed Akeel Shah and Syed Adeel Shah in an alleged arms license case being investigated under PMLA.
 On October 18, a single bench had declined to quash eviction notice against Akeel Shah and Adeel Shah, while holding that the Director or the authorized officer is not bound to wait till the expiry of the period of limitation for filing appeal for the purpose of taking action in terms of Section 8(4) of the PMLA.
 Deciding the LPA, the bench observed that Section 8(4) of the PMLA authorizes the Director or any other officer to take possession of the property regarding which provisional order of attachment has been confirmed.
 The bench recorded that as per the Rule 5(2) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Rules, 2013, once the attachment of immovable property has been confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority and it is found to be in possession of the owner, the authorized officer has to issue a notice of eviction of ten days so as to prevent the person from enjoying such property and if such person does not vacate the property within the stipulated time, he has to be evicted by taking possession thereof.
 The bench underscored that Section 26 of the PMLA gives a right of appeal to the aggrieved person against an order made by the Adjudicating Authority and the said appeal has to be filed within a period of 45 days from the date a copy of the order is received by the aggrieved person.
 The court noted that while an aggrieved person has a right of appeal against the order of attachment passed by the Adjudicating Authority which the aggrieved person has to avail within 45 days of receipt of order of attachment, the authorized officer or the Director has the jurisdiction to "forthwith" take possession of the property attached.
 "The expression "forthwith" is of great significance, in as much as it gives power to the Director or authorized officer to immediately proceed against the person whose property has been attached by virtue of order of Adjudicating Authority," said the court.
 Deliberating further on the issue the bench observed that the jurisdiction to proceed under Section 8(4) of the PMLA would come into play immediately upon passing of the order of attachment by the Adjudicating Authority and there is no scope to interpret the provisions contained in Section 8(4) and Section 26 of the PMLA and Rule 5(2) of the Rules of 2013 to hold that for taking action under Section 8(4) of the PMLA, the authorized officer has to await the expiry of period of limitation i.e., 45 days.
 "The order of confirmation of attachment passed by the Adjudicating Authority is just like a decree of a civil court which becomes executable the moment it is drawn," the bench underscored.
 It pointed out that just like execution of a decree of civil court is not to await the period of limitation for filing an appeal before the appellate court, similarly, an order passed under Section 8(3) of the PMLA is to be acted upon immediately and it cannot await the expiry of period of limitation for filing appeal against the said order.
 "Thus, the respondents were well within their powers to issue the impugned notice, which is in tune with the legal position as discernible from the provisions contained in Sections 8 and 26 of the PMLA read with Rule 5(2) of the Rules of 2013," the bench said while dismissing the pleas.
 They cannot bypass the remedy of appeal by invoking the writ jurisdiction of this Court simply by laying challenge to the proceedings which are essentially an offshoot of the order passed by the Adjudicating Authority, which is appealable under Section 26 of the PMLA," the court said.
 Dealing with the contention of the appellants that as per the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in Vijay Mandal Choudhary & Ors. Vs, Union of India & Ors.  (SC) 633, that resort to action under Section 8(4) of the PMLA should be only by way of an exception and not as a rule, the bench answered that there can be no dispute to the legal position in this regard, as has been clearly spelled out by the Supreme Court in the aforesaid case but the question whether a particular case is of exceptional nature or not, can be determined only by the appellate authority at the time of considering the merits of the appeal and not by this Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction.
 Dismissing the plea the division bench said that they do not find any ground to interfere in the judgments passed by the single bench as "the same are well-reasoned and lucid and deserve to be upheld."
 The court, however, left it open to the petitioners to "immediately" approach the appellate authority and persuade the said authority to stay the order of attachment in case, the appellants apprehend an immediate action against them by the respondents.

The Karnataka High Court has set aside the summons issued to Times Now, India Today Group, India Today Editor-in-Chief Aroon Purie and news anchors Rajdeep Sardesai and Shiv Aroor by a trial court on a complaint filed by former Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Bhojaraj Patil, alleging offences under Sections 499 and 500 of India Penal Code.
Justice V SRISHANANDA said the order taking cognizance and issuance of summons is mechanical in nature. The court remitted the matter for fresh consideration strictly in accordance with law. 
“The learned Magistrate has adopted a wrong procedure in allowing the advocate of the complainant to examine the complainant in chief when his sworn statement is recorded,” said the bench.
Karnataka High Court sets aside summons against @TimesNow, @IndiaToday, @aroonpurie, @sardesairajdeep and @ShivAroor in a criminal defamation case filed by politician Bhojaraj R. Patil related to airing of a sting operation by media.#KarnatakaHighCourt #Defamation pic.twitter.com/oPpOBuICSF— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) February 21, 2023
A sting operation was conducted when the complainant is alleged to be having a discussion in Hotel Lalit Ashok at Bengaluru on 27.05.2016. Rajya Sabha elections were being held at that juncture and there was a conversation with regard to the politicians leaving one political party and joining another party perhaps by luring them with money. The sentences spoken by the complainant, which were recorded in the sting operation, were aired in the electronic media and were also published in the print media.
In respect of the said incident, Patil had lodged a complaint with High Grounds Police Station, under Sections 417, 420, 468, 153A 120B r/w Section 34 of IPC and Section 65 of Information Technology Act, 2000, The High Court has already stayed proceeding in that case in a petition filed in 2017.
Alleging that by publication of the conversation, his fame in his constituency was reduced to such an extent that he lost the assembly election which was held in 2018, Patil filed a private complaint seeking action against Times Now, India Today and its journalists for the offences punishable under Sections 499 and 500 of IPC. Following which the impugned order dated 19.10.2019 came to be passed. 
The petitioners submitted that the order of issuing summons was passed in mechanical manner which is per se visible from the fact that the Magistrate has also taken cognizance for the offence punishable under Section 149 of IPC when no such allegations are found from the complaint averments.
The court said the magistrate has adopted a wrong procedure in allowing the advocate of the complainant to examine the complainant in chief when his sworn statement is recorded.” 
“Catena of judicial pronouncements of this Court has cautioned the District Judiciary that such a procedure is impermissible and it has to be discontinued. Despite such reported judicial pronouncements, the learned Magistrate has committed a grave error in allowing the examination-in-chief to be conducted while the sworn statement of the complainant is recorded. Further, the same is made as a basis for assessing the prima facie case to summon the petitioners herein,” it added.
Relying on coordinate bench judgment in the case of Naganagouda Veeranagouda Patil and Another vs. Malatesh H. Kulkarni and Others, the bench observed: “Section 200 of Cr.P.C, enjoins a mandatory duty on the Magistrate to examine the complainant and the witnesses present, if any. Therefore, mere examination of the complainant alone would not be sufficient to take cognizance of the offences alleged in a given case. At least one witness must support the cause of the complainant.” 
The court said admittedly except the complainant, no other person was examined. "The learned Magistrate has thus totally erred in not following the appropriate procedure and taking cognizance of the alleged offences against the petitioners herein,” it said.
The court also noted that Magistrate has also taken cognizance for the offence under Section 149 of IPC, though no such allegation is forthcoming in the complaint itself. 
"The entire sworn statement in the form of examination-in-chief does not also depict that the petitioners had shared the common object of defaming the complainant so as to invoke Section 149 of IPC," observed the court. 
Noting that a case has already been lodged by the complainant before High Grounds Police, the bench said: “What prevented the complainant to invoke Sections 499 and 500 of IPC in the same complaint is also a question that has not been looked into by the learned Magistrate while passing the order of issuing summons.” 
The court said that the order issuing summons suffers from legal infirmity and the procedural lapses and therefore, it needs to be quashed.
The court rejected the contention of the petitioners that if the court is of the opinion that continuation of the proceedings is nothing but abuse of process of law, mere quashing the order issuing summons would not serve the ends of justice and the whole complaint needs to be quashed. 
“Such a contention on behalf of the petitioners cannot be countenanced in law for the simple reason that if an order is challenged before the Court which is per se illegal, this Court is not expected to decide anything on merits of the matter, as the same may prejudice the case of the parties when the matter is remitted for fresh consideration before the competent Court,” it said.

The Supreme Court observed that High Courts are empowered to exercise limited factual review under Section 103 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
The bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao and S. Ravindra Bhat observed that the rule that sans a substantial question of law, the High Courts cannot interfere with findings of the lower Court or concurrent findings of fact, is subject to the following two important caveats.
First, if the findings of fact are palpably perverse or outrage the conscience of the court; in other words, it flies on the face of logic that given the facts on the record, interference would be justified.
Second, where the findings of fact may call for examination and be upset, in the limited circumstances spelt out in Section 103 CPC.
In this appeal, before the Apex Court against a High Court judgment allowing second appeal, the appellants contended that the High Court's jurisdiction is limited to examining only substantial questions of law. In this case, the court proceeded to appreciate the evidence, and differ with the findings of the first appellate court, which is the final court of facts, they contended.
Addressing this argument, the court observed thus in para 14 of the judgment:
Undoubtedly, the jurisdiction which a High Court derives under Section 100 is based upon its framing of a substantial question of law. As a matter of law, it is axiomatic that the findings of the first appellate court are final. However, the rule that sans a substantial question of law, the High Courts cannot interfere with findings of the lower Court or concurrent findings of fact, is subject to two important caveats. The first is that, if the findings of fact are palpably perverse or outrage the conscience of the court; in other words, it flies on the face of logic that given the facts on the record, interference would be justified. The other is where the findings of fact may call for examination and be upset, in the limited circumstances spelt out in Section 103 CPC.
Section 103 deals with the power of High Court to determine issues of fact. It provides that in any second appeal, the High Court may, if the evidence on the record is sufficient, determine any issue necessary for the disposal of the appeal:
 (a) which has not been determined by the lower Appellate Court or both by the Court of first instance and the lower Appellate Court
 (b) which has been wrongly determined by such Court or Courts reason of a decision on such question of law as is referred to in section 100.
The court noted that in Municipal Committee, Hoshiarpur v. Punjab State Electricity Board (2010) 13 SCC 216, the following observations have been made:
There is no prohibition on entertaining a second appeal even on a question of fact provided the court is satisfied that the findings of fact recorded by the courts below stood vitiated by non-consideration of relevant evidence or by showing an erroneous approach to the matter.If a finding of fact is arrived at by ignoring or excluding relevant material or by taking into consideration irrelevant material or if the finding so outrageously defies logic as to suffer from the vice of irrationality incurring the blame of being perverse, then the finding is rendered infirm in the eye of the law.
The court also referred to observations made in recent judgment in Narayan Sitaramji Badwaik (Dead) Through Lrs. v Bisaram :
"Moreover, the High Court, in second appeal proceeded to examine the documents in light of the evidence led and corrected the findings as it were under Section 103. If the appellants' arguments were to prevail, the findings of fact based upon an entirely erroneous appreciation of facts and by overlooking material evidence would necessarily have to remain and bind the parties, thereby causing injustice. It is precisely for such reasons that the High Courts are empowered to exercise limited factual review under Section 103 CPC. However, that such power could be exercised cannot be doubted. The impugned judgment does not expressly refer to that provision. In the circumstances of the case, it is evident that the High Court exercised the power in the light of that provision.", the court said while dismissing the appeal.

The Kerala High Court has established that the inconvenience of the power of attorney holder of the husband in a case before the Family Court (whether male or female) is not a reason to deny the transfer sought for by the wife.
Justice A. Badharudeen found that by appointing a power of attorney, a principal appoints an agent to conduct his case and such an agent can be anybody capable of travelling and contesting the case of the respondent for and on behalf of the respondent.
"Nobody is permitted to shield the contention of the wife after appointing an agent who is incapable to conduct the case, for reasons such as age old condition, ailment etc."
Is the inconvenience of the power of attorney holder of the husband a reason to disallow the transfer of a petition pending before the Family Court at the instance of the wife, highlighting her convenience?
The wife moved a transfer petition through Advocates P.V. Anoop, Phijo Pradeesh Philip, M.P Priyeshkumar and K.V. Sreeraj to transfer a case pending before the Family Court, Muvattupuzha to Kozhikode, where she has been residing permanently.
However, Advocate Shiras Aliyar opposed the transfer citing that the respondent is working abroad and therefore, he appointed his father as power of attorney to conduct the case. If the transfer is allowed, it would be inconvenient for his aged and ailing father to reach Kozhikode to conduct the case. Therefore, the transfer cannot be allowed, he urged. 
The Court found no merit in the objection raised by the respondent that, if the transfer sought for is allowed, the same would be inconvenient for the power of attorney holder.
Accordingly, taking note of the convenience of the wife, the transfer petition was allowed and the case pending before the Family Court, Muvattupuzha was transferred to Kozhikode.

The Allahabad High Court recently refused to quash the Chargesheet filed against 5 men including an engineer by profession, accusing them of pelting stones at police personnel in Bijnor district during the anti-CAA protests in 2019.
The bench of Justice Samir Jain noted that despite the fact that during the relevant time, section 144 Cr.P.C. had already been invoked in the city, a mob, which allegedly included the applicants, gathered and pelted stones at the police personnel, due to which a constable got injured.
Therefore, the Court held, that since the FIR prima facie disclosed cognizable offences against the applicants, the charge sheet pending against the applicants cannot be quashed.
The case in brief
As per the FIR, on December 16, 2019, a huge mob gathered at a public place to raise agitation against Citizenship Amendment Act (Bill) and when police arrived there and informed them that section 144 Cr.P.C. has already been invoked in the city, therefore, no procession can be commenced, then, instead of dispersal, the mob suddenly started an attack on police and due to their stone pelting, one police personnel, namely, Umesh Kumar sustained injuries.
A Chargesheet in the matter was filed in June 2020 against the applicants under Section 147, 148, 332, 336, 353, 188, 427, 109, 120-B, 153A, 295A IPC and the matter is presently pending in the court of Additional Civil Judge, Senior Division-Ist Bijnor.
Now, the petitioners moved to the High Court seeking to quash the charge sheet applicants arguing that they have been falsely implicated in the matter due to their previous enmity with the local police. 
It was next submitted that applicants neither pelted stones nor caused any injury to anyone including any police personnel and that even as per the FIR, the applicants had only gathered at the place of incident as protestors.
It was further submitted that only applicants nos. 1 and 2 were named in the FIR and the names of other applicants were disclosed during the investigation. The counsel further submitted that applicant no. 1 is an Engineer and he never indulged in such anti-social activities and that it is the constitutional right of a citizen to protest and merely being a part of peaceful agitation, one cannot be implicated in any criminal case.
However, the Court did not find it appropriate to quash the charge sheet against the applicants, as it noted that FIR prima facie disclosed cognizable offences against the applicants, and thus, their plea was dismissed.

The Supreme Court observed that the moratorium ordered under Section 14 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code does not apply in respect of the directors/management of the Corporate Debtor.
It applies only in relation to the Corporate Debtor and against its directors/management, proceedings could continue, the bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli observed.
In this case, the petitioners, who were home buyers in a group housing project, had approached the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission against Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. seeking refund of their moneys with interest. The NCDRC allowed their claim. In the execution proceedings, NCDRC required the personal presence of the Managing Director. Against this , it approached the Delhi High Court which directed no coercive steps shall be taken against the Managing Director. Challenging this order of the High Court, the home buyers approached the Apex Court. Thereafter, the NCDRC passed certain orders in the Execution Petition, which were assailed before the Apex Court in connected appeals.
During the pendency of the appeals, the Adjudicating Authority admitted the petition seeking Corporate Insolvency Resolution process and a moratorium was declared under Section 14 of the IBC. At the same time, the parties reached at some settlements before the Supreme Court.
Thus it was submitted before the court that since the moratorium declared in respect of the Corporate Debtor continues to operate under Section 14 of the IBC, no new proceedings can be undertaken or pending ones continued against the Corporate Debtor. In this context, the bench observed:
"At this juncture, we must however clarify the right of the petitioners to move against the promoters of the first respondent Corporate Debtor, even though a moratorium has been declared under Section 14 of the IBC. In the judgment in P. Mohanraj v. Shah Bros. Ispat (P) Ltd., a three judge Bench of this Court held that proceedings under Section 138 and 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 against the Corporate Debtor would be covered by the moratorium provision under Section 14 of the IBC. However, it clarified that the moratorium was only in relation to the Corporate Debtor (as highlighted above) and not in respect of the directors/management of the Corporate Debtor, against whom proceedings could continue." [Para 15]
The court referred to following observations made in P. Mohanraj v. Shah Bros. Ispat (P) Ltd. [ LL 2021 SC 120 ; (2021) 6 SCC 258 ]
"102. Thus, for the period of moratorium, since no Sections 138/141 proceeding can continue or be initiated against the corporate debtor because of a statutory bar, such proceedings can be initiated or continued against the persons mentioned in Sections 141(1) and (2) of the Negotiable Instruments Act. This being the case, it is clear that the moratorium provision contained in Section 14 IBC would apply only to the corporate debtor, the natural persons mentioned in Section 141 continuing to be statutorily liable under Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act."
The court thus clarified that the petitioners would not be prevented by the moratorium under Section 14 of the IBC from initiating proceedings against the promoters of the Corporate Debtor in relation to honoring the settlements reached before it.

The Kerala High Court recently asked an Assistant Passport Officer in Kottayam to shell out litigation expenses amounting to Rs. 25,000 from his own salary for objecting to re-issue passport to a single parent's daughter. In his order, Justice Amit Rawal has also called it a classic case of highhandedness by the Assistant Passport Officer objecting to re-issue the passport of children of a single parent facing a matrimonial discord and directing them to approach the court and obtain the court order. "...officers at the helm of affairs with the powers for issuing passports are supposed to deal with the application in a pragmatic and reasonable manner, but should not reject the application in (this) manner and mode..."
The Court also directed that a copy of this order be circulated to all passport officers. Advocates S. Ranjit and Gokul Das V.V.H appearing for the petitioner submitted that she is already divorced and is a single parent. They also argued that she had submitted a copy of the divorce to the officer apart from duly filling the Annexure C form enclosed with the passport form, giving an undertaking that the entire responsibility would be of her as there is already an order of divorce. Yet the officer objected to the re-issuance of her child's passport. ASGI S. Manu submitted that during the pendency of the petition, respondents have processed the petitioner's application and the passport shall be reissued in the name of the minor child. It was noted that day in and day out, applicants were compelled to approach the High Court for an appropriate order, despite filling the form Annexure 'C' for re-issuance of passport, particularly parents facing matrimonial discord or where there is already a separation. The Judge stated that although officers with the power to issue passports are to deal with the application in a pragmatic and reasonable manner, they should not reject one as done in this case. It was also observed that the respondent officer had processed the petitioner's application only because he knew full well that the Court would express concern about the series of cases on this issue and anticipated that it may come down heavily on his action. Therefore, for redressal of the grievance, the Assistant Passport Officer was impelled to shell out Rs. 25,000 as litigation expenses from his own salary. Since the application was already processed, the Officer was also directed to issue the impugned passport within one week.

The Gauhati High Court recently upheld the order of a trial court wherein it had rejected a plea on the ground that the defence side had failed to prove the contradictions of the witnesses in accordance with law. 
While examining the validity of such conclusion recorded by the learned trial court, the division bench of Justice Suman Shyam and Justice Robin Phukan relied on Section 145 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which laid down the manner in which cross-examination of the witnesses was to be made as to any previous statement made in writing.
The Court relied on the case of V. K. Mishra and another Vs. State of Uttarakhand and another where the Supreme Court had the occasion to consider the correct manner of proving contradictions as to any previous statement made by a witness. 
The Apex Court in that case had held,
"Under Section 145 of the Evidence Act when it is intended to contradict the witness by his previous statement reduced into writing, the attention of such witness must be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him, before the writing can be used. While recording the deposition of a witness, it become the duty of the trial court to ensure that the part of the police statement with which it is intended to contradict the witness is brought to the notice of the witness in his cross-examination. The attention of witness is drawn to that part and this must reflect in his cross-examination by reproducing it. If the witness admits the part intended to contradict him, it stands proved and there is no need to further proof of contradiction and it will be read while appreciating the evidence. If he denies having made that part of the statement, his attention must be drawn to that statement and must be mentioned in the deposition. By this process the contradiction is merely brought on record, but it is yet to be proved. Thereafter when investigating officer is examined in the court, his attention should be drawn to the passage marked for the purpose of contradiction, it will then be proved in the deposition of the investigating officer who again by referring to the police statement will depose about the witness having made that statement. The process again involves referring to the police statement and culling out that part with which the maker of the statement was intended to be contradicted. If the witness was not confronted with that part of the statement with which the defence wanted to contradict him, then the court cannot suo motu make use of statements to police not proved in compliance with Section 145 of the Evidence Act that is, by drawing attention to the parts intended for contradiction."
In the instant case, the High Court found that the defence counsel had failed to invite the attention of the witnesses to any previous statements in writing so as to contradict the witnesses. Therefore, it was of the view that the defence could not be permitted to avail the benefit of such alleged contradictions, if any, in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses.
These developments came in an appeal against conviction which was preferred by five appellants assailing the judgment and order dated 11.03.2019 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Sonitpur, Tezpur in a case where charges were framed against the accused persons under sections 302 read with section 149 of the IPC.
The trial court had sentenced each of them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life and also to pay fine of Rs.5000/- each and in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for three months each.
The trial court had held that the prosecution has succeeded in establishing the charges brought against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt, both by direct evidence of the eye-witness as well as by the circumstantial evidence. It had further held that the deceased was last seen together with the accused persons and therefore, the circumstance of "last seen together" would also be an additional link in the chain of circumstances which would support the prosecution case.
Furthermore, the defence counsel's argument that the testimony of the prosecution witnesses were full of inconsistencies and material contradictions raising serious doubt on the prosecution story was also rejected by the court below when it held that those were minor discrepancies which would have no bearing in the prosecution case. 
The trial court had thus held that the defence side had failed to prove the contradictions in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses by following the due procedure laid down by the law.
The High court went through the statements of all witnesses as recorded before the trial Court. 
It was found that during his cross-examination the I.O. had brought on record certain contradictions in the testimonies of a few prosecution witnesses. Since these contradictions were heavily relied upon by the defence side so as to impeach the prosecution case, the Court dealt with them in greater details.
The eye-witness had categorically deposed that he had seen 8/10 people including the appellants assaulting the deceased by means of "dao". The Court thus noted,
The evidence of PW-4 could not be shaken during his cross – examination. However, it is also seen from his statement recorded by the Police under section 161 Cr.P.C that the PW-4 did not mention the name of Abdul Kadir Gilani as one of the persons whom he had seen to have assaulted the victim. The name of Gilani has been added by PW-4 for the first time while deposing before the court. From the above it is evident that there has been some exaggeration and embellishment in the testimony of this witness. The question is, should the evidence of this witness be discarded due such exaggeration and embellishment ?
In this regard, the Court relied on the case of Leela Ram v State of Haryana, wherein the Supreme Court had observed that one hardly comes across a witness whose evidence does not contain some exaggeration or embellishment but the court can sift the chaff from the grain and find out the truth from the testimony of the witnesses. The evidence of such witnesses are to be considered from the point of view of trustworthiness. Total repulsion of the evidence would be unnecessary.
"In the present case, we have noticed that there are some omissions such as failure on the part of the PWs-4 and 9 to state before the police that they had arrived at the place of occurrence in a motorcycle or that the PW-1 had failed to state that he came riding in a motorcycle and in the flash of headlight of the motorbike he had seen the assailants leaving the place. But such omissions, in our view, do not erode the credibility of these witnesses since the basic facts stated by them before the police do not contradict their earlier statements in a manner such that both their statements cannot co-exist. Moreover, as mentioned above, the defence side has also failed to prove the contradictions in the statement of these witnesses in the manner required by law. On the contrary, we find that the version given by PWs-1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9 broadly bears up the same story without any vital contradictions and therefore, their evidence is found to be trustworthy", remarked the Court.
The Court further relied on a decision of a Division Bench of the High Court rendered in the case of Ghanakanta Das & others Vs. State of Assam wherein it held that the procedure to be followed in order to contradict the evidence adduced by the prosecution witnesses during trial with a statement made before the police during investigation would be to draw the attention of the witness to that part of the contradictory statement and question him as to whether, he did in fact make the statement. 
"If the witness admits to have made the particular statement before the Police then his admission would be recorded and would form part of his testimony and can be relied upon by the accused as establishing the contradiction. However, if the witness denies of having made such statement before the Police then the particular portion of the statement should be previously marked for identification and when the Investigation Officer (I.O.) comes to the witness box, he should be questioned as to whether the witness had made the particular statement before him during the course of investigation. The answer of the I.O would prove the contradiction. Unless the said procedure is followed and the witnesses are given opportunities for explanation, their previous statements made before the police cannot be used for contradictions. On such failure, it was held that the testimony of the witnesses could not have been thrown out on the ground that their evidence before the trial court has been contradicted by the previous statements made before the police."
In so far as ne of the appellant Md. Abdul Kadir Gilani was concerned, the Court held that evidence on record although indicated his presence in the place of occurrence but it was not sufficient to indicate his involvement in committing the offence.
"Therefore, there is a genuine doubt as regards his actual involvement in commissioning the crime. As such, giving the benefit of doubt, the conviction of appellant Md. Abdul Kadir Gilani is hereby set aside and he is acquitted of the charges brought against him. Consequently, we direct that the appellant Md. Abdul Kadir Gilani be forthwith released from jail if his custodial detention is not required in connection with any other case", ordered the Court.
 The appeal was thus partly allowed.

Senior Advoacte R. P. Sarmah, assisted by Advocate M. R. Adhikari, appeared for the appellants.  Additional Public Prosecutor, B. Bhuyan, appeared for the State/respondent No.1 and Advocate K. M. Haloi, represented the informant/ respondent No.2.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that the Competent Authority can not withhold the recommendation of a person indefinitely on the ground of adopting the sealed cover procedure during the pendency of the criminal case.
The bench of Justice Jaspreet Singh observed thus while granting relief to one Ranbir Singh (presently serving as a Tehsildar with the State Government and seeking promotion to the post of a Deputy Collector) by directing the Competent Authority to consider his claim of opening the sealed cover within a period of eight weeks from the date.
Essentially, it was the case of the petitioner that as per the prescribed procedure for promotion, he was due to be promoted from the post of Tehsildar to the post of Deputy Collector.
However, when the Departmental Promotion Committee, in its meeting held on August 23, 2018, prepared a list of Tehsildars to be promoted to the post of Deputy Collector and sent the same to the Public Service Commission, the same did not contain the name of the petitioner.
Upon making the inquiries, it was informed to him that his case had been withheld and had been put in a sealed cover as the petitioner was suspended on August 1, 2018, i.e. the date before the meeting of the DPC, on the basis of some allegations made to the Chairman of Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority.
The allegations were in respect of certain purchase of 57.149 hectares of land for the development by the Authority in District Mathura. 
Now, he moved the High Court seeking promotion by submitting that though he was suspended in August 2018, but the departmental chargesheet was served on the petitioner only in March 2021 i.e. after more than 2 and half years, and that too in compliance with the High Court's order.
It was also pointed out that in respect of the allegations, the criminal proceedings were also initiated in September 2019 in the Court of Special Judge, Meerut, however, the petitioner was enlarged on bail in October 2019 and though the trial is still pending and out of 27 witnesses only one witness has been examined.
It was strongly argued by the Counsels appearing for the petitioner led by Senior Advocate Anoop Trivedi that the persons junior to the petitioner have been promoted and only on the basis of the case which is pending against the petitioner, his case has been placed under sealed cover, and even though the criminal trial may take time, yet, the promotion of the petitioner cannot be deferred or kept in abeyance indefinitely.
It was lastly submitted that the filing of a chargesheet subsequent to the date of DPC may not have any adverse impact as the date when the case of the petitioner was to be considered by the DPC is of importance and on that day no proceedings were pending
Taking into account the above submission, the Court, at the outset, referred to the ruling of the Apex Court in the case of K. V. Jankiraman (supra), wherein it was held that the sealed cover procedure is to be resorted to only after the charge-memo/charge-sheet is issued and that the pendency of preliminary investigation prior to that stage will not be sufficient to enable the authorities to adopt the sealed cover procedure.
In this very case, it was also held that the promotion cannot be withheld merely because some disciplinary/criminal proceedings are pending against the employee and that to deny the said benefit, they must be at the relevant time pending at the stage when the charge-memo/charge sheet has already been issued to the employee. 
In this regard, the Court also referred to the High Court's ruling in the case of Km. Maya (Mahila Constable Vs. State of U.P. and others) (2011) 5 ADJ 818
Against this backdrop, the Court observed thus:
"Having considered the aforesaid submissions and the dictum of the Apex Court in the case of K.V. Jankiraman (supra) and this Court in the case of Km. Maya (Supra), the fact that irrespective of the pendency of the criminal case, the petitioner has continued to serve and mere pendency of the criminal case cannot be taken as a ground to deny the promotion to the petitioner nor the Competent Authority can withhold the recommendation of the petitioner indefinitely on the ground of adopting the sealed cover procedure during the pendency of the criminal case."
Accordingly, the petition was disposed of with a direction to the Competent Authority to consider the claim of the petitioner for opening the sealed cover within a period of eight weeks.

The Supreme Court observed that there cannot be repeated Test Identification Parades till such time that the prosecution is successful in obtaining identification of the accused.
The bench of Justices Navin Sinha and R. Subhash Reddy observed that mere identification in the test identification parade cannot form the substantive basis for conviction unless there are other facts and circumstances corroborating the identification. It reiterated that a test identification parade under Section 9 of the Evidence Act is not substantive evidence in a criminal prosecution but is only corroborative evidence.
In this case, the accused were convicted by the Trial Court on the basis of them being identified in a test identification parade (TIP). In appeal before the Supreme Court, they contended that the conviction based on the TIP is unsustainable as no TIP has been proved to have been held in accordance with law.  It was further submitted that repeated TIPs have been held only after which the accused were 'identified'. 
While considering the appeal, the court noted that the case of the prosecution solely rests on identification in the TIP. 
"A test identification parade under Section 9 of the Evidence Act is not substantive evidence in a criminal prosecution but is only corroborative evidence. The purpose of holding a test identification parade during the stage of investigation is only to ensure that the investigating agency prima facie was proceeding in the right direction where the accused may be unknown or there was a fleeting glance of the accused. Mere identification in the test identification parade therefore cannot form the substantive basis 3 for conviction unless there are other facts and circumstances corroborating the identification. But more important than that, the test identification parade being a part of the investigation, has to be proved by the prosecution as having been held in accordance with law.", the court said.
The court added that the onus lies on the prosecution to establish that the TIP was held in accordance with law. It is only after the prosecution prima facie establishes a valid TIP having been held, the question of considering any objection to the same arises. "If the prosecution has failed to establish that a TIP was properly held by examining the witnesses to the same, there is nothing for the accused to disprove.", it said.
 In the present case, the court noted that a Magistrate had conducted the TIP, but was not examined and prosecution offered no explanation for it.
"There cannot be repeated TIPs till such time that the prosecution is successful in obtaining identification of the accused. We find it extremely disturbing that both the Trial Court and the High Court did not go into this aspect at all to satisfy  themselves if any TIP had been proved to have been held at all and that too in accordance with the law.", the bench observed while acquitting the accused.

The Allahabad High Court has recently observed that the right to change the name is a facet of a fundamental right as guaranteed under Article 19(1) (a) of the Constitution of India and that such a right cannot be denied. 
Essentially, the bench of Justice Pankaj Bhatia observed this while hearing the plea of a lady (named Rajni Shrivastava) who wanted to change her name to 'Rashmi Srivastava', however, her application regarding this was rejected by the UP Secondary Education board.
The board said that her application was rejected on the ground that in terms of the mandate of the provisions as contained in the Regulations under Chapter III Regulation 7 of the Regulations framed under the Intermediate Education Act 1921 that the said request was beyond the prescribed limitation under the said Regulations.
However, allowing her writ plea, the Court directed the concerned authorities to carry out the desired change of name in the mark sheet and Certificate.
The case in brief
The petitioner wanted to change her name and therefore, she took steps for getting the same intent published in the newspapers. Pursuant to this, in her Aadhar card and Permanent Account Number (PAN), the changes were made and her name was recorded as Rashmi Srivastava. 
However, there arose a discrepancy in the Aadhar Card, PAN Card, and the Bank Account on one hand as contrasted with the High School Certificate, the Intermediate Certificate, and the Graduation Certificate where the name of the petitioner was recorded as Rajni Shrivastava.
Her application regarding her intent to change her name was rejected by the Secondary Education Board and a similar representation was rejected by the University authorities as well on the ground that unless the correction as desired by the petitioner is made in the High School records, no consequent action can be taken.
Therefore, she moved to the High Court with her instant writ plea.
Court's observations 
The Court took into account the judgment in the cases of Kabir Jaiswal v. Union of India & Ors. and Jigya Yadav vs. C.B.S.E. LL 2021 SC 264 to note that the right to change the name is a facet of a fundamental right as guaranteed under Article 19(1) (a) of the Constitution of India and cannot be denied. 
Further, the Court said that the foundation based upon which the application of the petitioner was rejected namely that the request was made beyond the limitation prescribed under Regulation 7, was wholly untenable as the same militated against the law laid down by the High Court in the case of Anand Singh vs. U.P. Board of Secondary Education and others (2014) 3 ADJ 443 (DB).
With this, the Court directed the petitioner to move an appropriate application afresh along with a copy of the Court's order and the documents including the Aadhar Card and the PAN Card before the concerned authority along with the original certificate and mark-sheet. 
"On receiving such application, the respondent no.2 is directed to carry out the desired change of name in the marksheet and Certificate. However, it is clarified that in the fresh certificate and mark-sheet issued to the petitioner, it would contain the name 'Rashmi Srivastava alias/nee, Rajni Shrivastava'. The said exercise shall be completed by the respondent no.2 within six weeks from the date of filing of the application. The petitioner shall thereupon be entitled to file the application before the respondents no.3 and 4 along with original records who shall also make the necessary corrections in the educational certificates/records issued to the petitioner in the light of the said fresh certificate issued to the respondent no.2. It is further directed that the respondent no.2 shall carry out the necessary corrections in the intermediate examination records of the petitioner also which shall be in consonance with the name change, as recorded in the High School Certificate in terms of the directions given above," the Court further directed as it disposed of the plea.

The Supreme Court held that parties to a contract who are Indian nationals or Companies incorporated in India can choose a forum for arbitration outside India.
"Nothing stands in the way of party autonomy in designating a seat of arbitration outside India even when both parties happen to be Indian nationals", the bench headed by Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman observed.
The bench was considering the question whether two companies incorporated in India can choose a forum for arbitration outside India in the case  PASL Wind Solutions Private Limited Vs. GE Power Conversion India Private Limited.
In this case, a contract was entered between two companies, both incorporated in India under the Companies Act, 1956. Clause 6 (Arbitration Clause) provided that the disputes between them shall be referred to and finally resolved by Arbitration in Zurich in accordance with the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. As the disputes eventually arose between the Companies, it was referred to arbitration before International Chamber of Commerce. One of the parties filed a preliminary application challenging the jurisdiction of the arbitrator on the ground that two Indian parties could not have chosen a foreign seat of arbitration. This objection was rejected by the Arbitrator who continued the proceedings and passed Final Award. The successful party filed enforcement proceedings under sections 47 and 49 of the Arbitration Act before the High Court of Gujarat. 
Before the Apex Court, the appellant company contended that : 
(1) Two Indian parties cannot designate a seat of arbitration outside India as doing so would be contrary to section 23 of the Indian Contract Act,  read with section 28(1)(a) and section 34(2A) of the Arbitration Act. 
(2) Foreign awards contemplated under Part II of the Arbitration Act arise only from international commercial arbitrations. "International commercial arbitration", as has been defined in section 2(1)(f) of the Arbitration Act, would make it clear that there has to be a foreign element when parties arbitrate outside India, the foreign element being that at least one of the parties is, inter alia, a national of a country other than India, or habitually resident in a country other than India, or a body corporate incorporated outside India. For this reason, the award passed in the present case cannot be designated as a foreign award under Part II of the Arbitration Act. 
(3) When there is no foreign element involved in an award made in Zurich between two Indian companies, such award cannot be the subject matter of challenge or enforcement either under Part I or Part II of the Arbitration Act. 
(4) There is a head-on conflict between section 10(3) of the Commercial Courts Act and section 47 of the Arbitration Act, as a result of which the former must prevail.
To address these contentions, the bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Hrishikesh Roy, referred to various provisions of the Arbitration Act and various precedents and made the following observations:
Part I and Part II of the Arbitration Act are mutually exclusive 
The Arbitration Act is in four parts. Part I deals with arbitrations where the seat is in India and has no application to a foreign-seated arbitration. It is, therefore, a complete code in dealing with appointment of arbitrators, commencement of arbitration, making of an award and challenges to the aforesaid award as well as execution of such awards. On the other hand, Part II is not concerned with the arbitral proceedings at all. It is concerned only with the enforcement of a foreign award, as defined, in India. Section 45 alone deals with referring the parties to arbitration in the circumstances mentioned therein. Barring this exception, in any case, Part II does not apply to arbitral proceedings once commenced in a country outside India
Re: Section 23 Contract Act
Freedom of contract needs to be balanced with clear and undeniable harm to the public, even if the facts of a particular case do not fall within the crystallised principles enumerated in well-established 'heads' of public policy. The question that then arises is whether there is anything in the public policy of India, as so understood, which interdicts the party autonomy of two Indian persons referring their disputes to arbitration at a neutral forum outside India.
Re Section 28, 34 Arbitration Act
Section 28(1)(a) of the Arbitration Act, when read with section 2(2), section 2(6) and section 4, provides that, where the place of arbitration is situated in India, in an arbitration other than an international commercial arbitration (i.e. an arbitration where none of the parties, inter alia, happens to be a national of a foreign country or habitually resident in a foreign country), the arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with the substantive law for the time being in force in India. The Appellant's contention was that since two Indian parties cannot opt out of the substantive law of India and therefore, ought to be confined to arbitrations in India, Indian public policy, as reflected in these two sections, ought to prevail
"52. It can be seen that section 28(1)(a) of the Arbitration Act makes no reference to an arbitration being conducted between two Indian parties in a country other than India, and cannot be held, by some tortuous process of reasoning, to interdict two Indian parties from resolving their disputes at a neutral forum in a country other than India.  Take the case of an Indian national who is habitually resident in a country outside India. Any dispute between such Indian national and an Indian national who is habitually resident in India would attract the provisions of section 2(1)(f)(i) and, consequently, section 28(1)(b) of the Arbitration Act, in which case two Indian nationals would be entitled to have their dispute decided in India in accordance with the rules of law designated by the parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute, which need not be Indian law. This, by itself, is a strong indicator that section 28 of the Arbitration Act cannot be read in the manner suggested by Mr. Himani.", the court said while rejecting this contention.
Re: Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act.  
"We have already seen how "international commercial arbitration", when used in the proviso to section 2(2) of the Arbitration Act, does not refer to the definition contained in section 2(1)(f) but would have reference to arbitrations which take place outside India, awards made in such arbitrations being enforceable under Part II of the Arbitration Act. It will be noted that section 10(1) applies to international commercial arbitrations, and applications or appeals arising therefrom, under both Parts I and II of the Arbitration Act. When applications or appeals arise out of such arbitrations under Part I, where the place of arbitration is in India, undoubtedly, the definition of "international commercial arbitration" in section 2(1)(f) will govern. However, when applied to Part II, "international commercial arbitration" has reference to a place of arbitration which is international in the sense of the arbitration taking place outside India. Thus construed, there is no clash at all between section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act and the explanation to section 47 of the Arbitration Act, as an arbitration resulting in a foreign award, as defined under section 44 of the Arbitration Act, will be enforceable only in a High Court under section 10(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, and not in a district court under section 10(2) or section 10(3)."

The Karnataka High Court has suggested that the Central Government make necessary amendments to Section 372 of the Criminal Procedure Code, in order to provide an opportunity to victims to approach the Court in appeal seeking enhancement of sentence imposed on a convict.
 A single judge bench of Justice H P Sandesh said,
"No doubt, when the remedy provided to the State to file an appeal in the event of inadequate sentence, It requires consideration to suitably amend Section 372 of Cr.P.C., conferring the right to the victim also to file an appeal making necessary amendment to Section 372 of Cr.P.C, or otherwise it is a discrimination against the victim, when the appeal is provided to the State."
 It added, "Hence, it is appropriate to direct the Central Government to make necessary amendment to provide an opportunity to the victim also to approach the Court for seeking an enhancement of sentence and the said right of anomaly under the provisions of Section 372 of Cr.P.C., requires to be set right, for insertion of a right to a victim to question the order of sentence and seek for an enhancement of sentence."
 Presently under section 372 of Cr.P.C, the victim is qualified to file an appeal in the event of acquittal of the accused or conviction for lesser offence or for imposing inadequate compensation only.
 The bench made this suggestion while dismissing a criminal revision petition filed by the original complainant, former IAS officer BA Harish Gowda seeking to enhance the sentence of nine months imposed on Ravi Kumar, Editor, Publisher and Printer of Parivala Pathrike Journal, who was convicted under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code.
 Instead, it allowed the revision petition filed by the accused and set aside the order of the lower appellate court which enhanced the sentence of six months imposed on the accused by the trial court to nine months, on an appeal filed by the complainant.
 The bench said,
"In the case on hand, the appeal was filed under Section 374 of Cr.P.C., before the Trial Court and under Section 374 of Cr.P.C., no such provision is provided to file an appeal by the victim against the order of the Trial Court for enhancement of sentence. No doubt, there is a provision under Section 372 of Cr.P.C, the same is also not provided for an appeal for enhancement of sentence. Hence, the Appellate Court ought not to have entertained the said appeal for enhancement of sentence and committed an error in enhancing the sentence when the statute does not provide such an appeal."
 It added, "No statutory provision is provided to the victim to file an appeal, the revision filed by the complainant against the order of the Appellate Court and the Trial Court for lesser sentence, is not maintainable. Consequently, the revision filed by the accused deserves to be allowed and the order of the Appellate Court requires it to be set aside."
 Case Details:
 On the complaint made by Gowda against the accused in the year 2000, the accused after a long drawn litigation was found guilty by the trial court on judgment dated 30.08.2017, the Trial Court convicted the accused and sentenced him for a period of 6 months for the offence under Section 500 of IPC and imposed fine of Rs.25,000.
 Following which the complainant as well as the accused filed an appeal. The complainant, in his appeal sought for an order to enhance the sentence and the accused in his appeal questioned the conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court. 
The Appellate Court, dismissed the appeal filed by the accused and allowed the appeal filed by the complainant, however modified the sentence enhancing the imprisonment for a period of 9 months with a fine of Rs.10,000/-. Being aggrieved by the order of modification of sentence, these three revision petitions are filed by the accused as well as the complainant.
 Complainant's submissions: 
 It was said the accused had indulged in making false imputations in the journal and the document on record reveals that it is defamatory per-se which fact has not been rebutted by the accused either before the Trial Court or before the Appellate Court or before this Court in these petitions or on the earlier occasions.
 The false and concocted imputations directed against the complainant by the accused are not only defamatory, but they are also very grave in nature meant to ensure deep impact on the minds of the reader and words will not be sufficient to describe the mental agony, humiliation and physical hardship undergone by the complainant in the past 20 years. The very nature of false imputations reproduced in the complaint is sufficient to prove that the punishment imposed upon the accused to convict is insufficient.
 Further relying on several judgments of the Supreme Court, it was said that the accused has not been examined before the Trial Court to prove either good faith or the imputations have been made for public good.
 Accused on the other hand argued that the entire facts does not reveal that there is no intention to damage the reputation of the respondent, the appellants did not have any intention or mens rea to commit the offence under Section 500 of IPC. This fact has not been considered by both the Courts and also not considered the cross-examination of P.Ws.1 and 2 and failed to consider his defence.
 It was further submitted that the appeal filed by the respondent complainant under Section 374(3) of CrPC itself is not maintainable because Section 374 of CrPC provides for an appeal against the conviction and the complainant does not have any right to file an appeal. It is also contended that the alleged defamatory statement was published in the year 2000 and 20 years have elapsed and the accused is put to great hardship.
 The very appeal filed before the Appellate Court is not maintainable but, the Appellate Court enhanced the sentence erroneously even without jurisdiction.
 Court findings:
 The court though dismissed the petition filed by the complainant seeking enhancement of sentence it upheld the order of the trial court convicting the accused to suffer six months imprisonment under section 500 IPC.
 It said, "Though defence was taken in the cross-examination that the said article was published with good faith and for the benefit of the public good, in order to substantiate the same, no material is placed before the Court."
 The court opined, "It is also important to note that the complainant also fought before the Court almost from the last two decades to prove the fact that his reputation has been spoiled on account of the defamatory per-se allegations made against him and these aspects are also considered by both the Trial Court as well as the Appellate Court. "
 It then held, "When the material has been considered by the Trial Court as well as the Appellate Court and given finding on the basis of the evidence available on record, it cannot be said that the order passed by both the Courts are perverse and no material on record to substantiate the same."
 It added, "When such being the case and when the accused has also not led any evidence before the Trial Court to substantiate his contention that the same was made with good faith and for the public good, both the Courts have not committed any error while appreciating the material on record and have given anxious consideration to the evidence available on record."
 Accordingly it dismissed the appeal filed by the complaint seeking enhancement of sentence of 9 months and quashed and set aside the appellate court order which enhanced the sentence from six months to nine months. The bench also confirmed the order of the trial court which convicted the accused and sentenced him to 6 months imprisonment and to pay fine of Rs.10,000.
 Further it directed the Registry to send this copy of the judgment to the Ministry of justice to examine and do the needful, as observed in the judgment while answering point Nos.(i) and (ii) regarding anomaly in the statute to set right of appeal to the victim for necessary amendment to provide right of appeal to the victim for enhancement of sentence.

Hate speech strikes at the preambular goals of liberty, equality, and fraternity that are the foundational values embedded in our Constitution, said Justice B.V. Nagarathna, while delivering a dissenting judgement proposing to hold the government vicariously liable for a statement made by a minister that is traceable to any affairs of the state or for the protection of the government by invoking the principle of collective responsibility. While the other four judges on the Constitution Bench, namely, Justices S. Abdul Nazeer, B.R. Gavai, A.S. Bopanna, and V. Ramasubramanian rejected the contention that vicarious liability could be envisaged in such a situation, Justice Nagarathna dissented on this point (while concurring with majority on other issues).
 In her separate opinion, she analysed the critical and doctrinal underpinnings justifying a restraint on derogatory and discouraging speech with respect to two primary factors – human dignity as a value as well as a right, and the preambular goals of equality and fraternity. “Hate speech strikes at the foundational values of the Constitution by marking out a society as being unequal. It also violates the fraternity of citizens from diverse backgrounds, which is the sine qua non of a cohesive society based on plurality and multiculturalism such as in India that is Bharat,” the judge said. Speaking about fraternity, Justice Nagarathna asserted that it was based on the idea that citizens had reciprocal responsibilities towards one another and took within its sweep, inter alia, the ideals of tolerance, cooperation and mutual aid.
 The Supreme Court judge reiterated that it was a fundamental duty of every citizen of India to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of the country and promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood between all the people of India, transcending religious, linguistic, regional, and sectional diversities. Every citizen was under a constitutional obligation, she added, to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women and to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity, “so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement”. She explained that the fundamental duties of citizens also constituted the core constitutional values for good citizenship in our democracy. “All citizens were enjoined with the obligation of promoting fraternity, harmony, unity, and collective welfare,” Justice Nagarathna said.
 Justice Nagarathna further observed that public functionaries and other persons of influence and celebrities, having regard to their reach and their impact on the public or a certain section, were duty bound to be more responsible and restrained in their speech. “They are required to understand and measure their words having regard to the likely consequences on public sentiment and behaviour and also be aware of the example they are setting on the fellow citizens to follow.” She also cautioned that it was for the political parties to regulate and control the action and speech of their functionaries and members. “This could be through a code of conduct which would prescribe the limits of permissible speech by functionaries and members of the respective political parties,” the judge suggested.
 Finally, she reminded that any citizen who is subjected to hate speech by a public functionary or otherwise would be entitled to approach a court of law and seek appropriate remedies. “Whenever permissible, civil remedies in the nature of declaratory remedies, injunctions as well as pecuniary damages may be awarded as prescribed under relevant statues,” she said.

Additional Restrictions Not Found In Article 19(2) Cannot Be Imposed On Right To Free Speech : Supreme Court
Case Title
Kaushal Kishor v. State of UP | WP (Crl) No. 113/2016

The Supreme Court observed that a Ballistic Report forwarded by Director/ Deputy Director/ Assistant Director of a lab under the seal can be said to be in compliance with the statutory requirement under Section 293 Cr.P.C.
Section 293 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows: Any document purporting to be a report under the hand of a Government scientific expert to whom this section applies, upon any matter or thing duly submitted to him for examination or analysis and report in the course of any proceeding under this Code, may be used as evidence in any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code.
In this case, reversing the acquittal by the Trial Court, the Allahabad High convicted all the accused for the offences under Sections 148, 302 read with 149, 307 read with 149 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced them to life imprisonment. The Trial Court, while acquitting accused in a murder case, had refused to admit ballastic report on the ground that it is not a report selfsigned by an Assistant Director but that of some Scientific Officer, which has been merely forwarded by the Assistant Director. The High Court, while allowing appeal, held that the report could not have been discarded.
On this aspect, while affirming the views of the High Court, the Apex Court bench observed that the requirement under Section 293 is in fact complied with as the report should be treated as under the hand of the Government Scientific Expert, being the "Director [, Deputy Director or Assistant Director] of a Central Forensic Science Laboratory or a State Forensic Science Laboratory" as provided under Section 293(4)(e). Referring to observations made in State of Himachal Pradesh v. Mast Ram (2004) 8 SCC 660, the bench of Justices said:
"In view of the fact that the ballistic report has come from the office of the Assistant Director bearing his seal and having considered the same in the context of Section 293(4) Cr.P.C., as explained by this Court in State of Himachal Pradesh v. Mast Ram, we are opinion that the Trial Court committed a serious error in rejecting the ballistic report and it was necessary and compelling for the High Court to reverse the finding of the Trial Court on this count also".
In its judgment upholding the High Court judgment, the bench has also discussed in detail various factual and legal aspects involved in this case [Please see headnotes].

Section 394 of the MMC Act imposes a restriction upon certain activities to be carried out within limits of the Corporation except on the licence granted by the Commissioner and this includes carrying of any trade upon any premises which is specified in part IV of Schedule M or any process or operation connected with any such trade and Part IV of Schedule 'M' cover an activity of 'lodging', the court noted. 
A Vile Parle resident Harmesh Chadha had let out some rooms of his bungalow as a bed & breakfast lodging following a 2013 permission under a scheme floated by MTDC. Previously since 2010 it was running on a license from ITDC under the Incredible India scheme. In January, the BMC officers inspected his premises and issued him a warning to discontinue the trade within 7 days of receipt of the letter and also issued a seizure action notice the next day under section 394 of the MMC Act. 
Chadha filed an appeal against this seizure order. He argued that the BMC had no role as MTDC had permitted it and it was not classified as a "trade establishment" but was a "homestay" to promote tourism. He drew attention to the fact that he resides in the same bungalow with his family and only the ground floor rooms were let out. BMC acted as per a "mala fide" complaint by a local resident, alleged Chadha. He demanded that the BMC inspection report and the seizure action be declared bad-in-law. 
BMC justified its notice to discontinue the bed & breakfast as section 394 of the MMC Act necessitated a civic licence for such activity. It pointed out that certain businesses require licenses from various authorities. 
The court noted that while at first blush Chadha's argument of inapplicability of the BMC law appears attractive but on closer scrutiny, it is not so. Under the MTDC scheme "registration to operate an establishment of B&B facility in a residential house is not a purely commercial venture as what is expected is, some of the rooms of the residential house, are permitted to offer B&B facility. This, however, prima facie will not absolve the establishment to obtain necessary other permission/licences which are required for its operation. The property is not exempted completely from the tax, but certain concession is granted. In order to operate the facility as a lodging , it would necessarily require compliance of condition like health licence since the Corporation is responsible for the cleanliness and ensuring that requisite facilities being made available to the customers, who are taking benefit of the lodging . It would also require compliance of the building permit and it cannot be said that on the MTDC granting the permission, the changes in the residential premises will not have to be ratified/ authorized by the Building department of the Corporation." 
The court stated that "such an establishment will necessarily have to obtain the fire safety permit as well as the permission from the FSSAI, since food is being offered to the tourist at such as establishment. Prima facie , the license which is required to be obtained u/s. 394 in order to operate a trading or activity upon the premises cannot be said to be exempted , merely on registration of the facility with MTDC."

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has recently observed that a promise to marry, whereby two adults engaged in a physical sexual relationship is a case of courtship and love affair, and by no stretch of the imagination would it come within the definition of Section 375 of IPC [Rape].
The Bench of Justice Mohan Lal further ruled that only when there is a case of a false promise made with the purpose of obtaining the consent of a woman for sexual favor, the same amounts to misrepresentation and consent so obtained, cannot exonerate a person from criminal liability for the commission of rape.
The case in brief
Essentially, one Ashok Kumar had moved the Court last year seeking anticipatory bail in a case registered against him for rape as it was alleged that he made sexual relations with the victim many times after obtaining her consentt under the misconception of fact that he would marry her and therefater, he started ignoring her and also threatened her that she would face dire consequences if she ever tried to call him.
Earlier, in July 2021, he was granted interim bail by the High Corut with the directions that he would appear before the Investigating Officer and shall not contact with any prosecution witness. 
However, in September 2021, the counsel for complainant/prosecutrix filed an application for cancellation/revocation of interim bail granted to him on the ground that he was continuously harassing and threatening the prosecutrix after the grant of bail.
It was also alleged that the applicant/accused came at the residence of the prosecutrix and threatened her of dire consequences and pressurized her and other family members to withdraw the FIR.
Court's observations 
The Court persued the contents of the FIR lodged against the bail applicant and noted that there was not an iota of whisper that applicant/accused had made false promise or the applicant/accused had engaged in sexual relations with the victim on the basis of the false promise. 
"There is also no allegation in FIR that when applicant/accused promised to marry the complainant/victim, it was done in bad faith or with intention to deceive her. From the contents of FIR, it appears that there is a failure on the part of applicant/accused to fulfill his promise of marriage made in the year 2017 which he could not fulfill in 2021," the Court further noted.
Further, the Court observed that when there was no allegation in the FIR that the promise made by the accused was false, the physical relationship of the accused with the victim does not amount to offence of rape within the meaning of Section 375 of IPC.
The Court also took into account significant rulings of the Supreme Court on when 'False promise of marriage amounts to rape' including J&K High Court's ruling in the case of Tanveer Iqbal vs State and others 2018 (2) Crimes (HC) 264, wherein it was observed thus:
"...when there is a long duration of consensual physical relation between the two under the pretext or promise that the accused will marry her but now backed out and it has not been alleged even by the prosecutrix that false promise of marriage was made for establishing physical relation, it is thus simply a case of courtship and consensual physical relation between the two grownup which even did not end up tying nuptial knot is not a case of commission of rape."
Against this backdrop, having regard to the facts of the case, the Court held that there was no false promise to marriage made by the Applicant-accsued to complainant/prosecutrix in the instant case.
 "Contents of FIR demonstrates that applicant/accused though has agreed to marry the prosecutrix and both of them were involved in physical sexual relations and it is thus simply a case of courtship and consensual physical relation which in my considered view does not amount to commission of rape," the Court further remarked.
Consequently, the anticipatory bail granted to applicant/accused in July 2021 was made absolute subject to the conditions that applicant/accused, if required by the investigating agency, shall appear before the Investigating Officer during the course of investigation and shall not threaten or intimidate any prosecution witnesses.

The Allahabad High Court has granted bail to Nizamuddin Khan, the State President of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in the UAPA case over his alleged connection with the banned organization Popular Front of India (PFI) and involvement in anti-national activities. Khan, who has been booked under sections 295A, 109, 120B, 201 I.P.C., and section 13 of UAPA, was arrested on September 27, 2022, from Aligarh allegedly with objectionable material and unconstitutional literature. As per the FIR, Khan has been accused of recruiting youth against the central and state governments and against the RSS with the support of the PFI. After his bail plea was rejected by Sessions Court in Aligarh, he moved to the High Court seeking regular bail.

Before the bench of Justice Ajit Singh, his counsel argued that there is no evidence on record, which could show that the applicant is involved in any anti-national activity nor did he hurt the religious sentiment of any community in any manner. It was further argued that he is absolutely innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case with the ulterior intention of harassing him. It was lastly submitted that he has no criminal history and he is languishing in jail since 27.9.2022 and in case he is released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail and will cooperate in the trial. Though the state counsel opposed his bail plea, the Court, keeping in view the nature of the offence, evidence, complicity of the accused, severity of the punishment, and submissions of learned counsel for the parties, considering the law laid down in the case of Data Ram Vs. State of U.P. and others, 2018(3) SCC 22, and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, found him entitled to be enlarged on bail during the pendency of the trial. Consequently, the Court ordered that he be released on bail on his executing a personal bond and furnishing two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned.

 The Supreme Court has constituted a committee to evolve a "comprehensive traffic management plan" for Kaushambi, Ghaziabad.
A bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud, MR Shah and Sanjiv Khanna passed a direction in this regard in a writ petition filed by the President of the Kaushambi Apartments Resident Welfare Association under Article 32 of the Constitution, highlighting a magnitude of problems faced by Kaushambi, Ghaziabad residents.
The petition highlighted several issues, ranging from haphazard traffic management to environmental pollution and unrestricted dumping of municipal solid waste. As a result, it has been submitted that the residents of the area are suffering from serious respiratory issues. There is an added concern over contaminated ground water.
The bench decided to take up the problem of traffic management at the first instance. It observed that it cannot be seen as a mere law enforcement problem and a comprehensive traffic management plan was needed.
"...we are categorically of the view that the problems which have confronted Kaushambi and Ghaziabad, in general,cannot be treated in a manner isolated from the wider context of the National Capital Region. This is not merely a matter which pertains to the Ghaziabad Development Authority or, for that matter, other authorities within the State of Uttar Pradesh alone. There has to be a coordinated effort on the part of the authorities within the Government of NCT of Delhi, East Delhi Municipal Corporation as well as the statutory authorities in the State of Uttar Pradesh having jurisdiction in the area", the Court observed in the order. 
It has formed a committee with the following members :
(i)Divisional Commissioner, Meerut;
(ii)Chairperson, Ghaziabad Development Authority;
(iii)Municipal Commissioner, Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam;
(iv)District Magistrate, Ghaziabad;
(v)The Chairperson of UPSRTC;
(vi)Senior Superintendent of Police, Ghaziabad;
(vii)Municipal Commissioner, East Delhi Municipal Corporation;
(viii)A senior officer to be nominated by the Commissioner of Police; and
(ix)The Transport Secretary of the Government of NCT of Delhi.
The District Magistrate, Ghaziabad shall be the nodal officer of the Committee. The comprehensive traffic management plan has to be submitted within three weeks.
Concerted and joint efforts by authorities needed
The Court observed that unless all the authorities put their heads together and jointly agree on aconcerted effort to manage the traffic problems, a resolution would not be possible.
The Court observed :
"Some of these problems do not necessarily originate in Ghaziabad,such as the problem which is caused by the back-up of vehicles at toll booths.The Anand Vihar Terminal, the Court has been apprised, takes care of the need of the buses of the Delhi Transport Corporation and inter-state buses which originate and terminate at the Terminal. However, we do find that there is a total absence of adequate space for the parking of other public service vehicles including intra-state buses within Ghaziabad, as a result of which the vehicles are parked in a haphazard manner on public roads, including service roads. 
 Infact, we find from the photographs, which have been produced by the petitioners, that there is even a public board stipulating that the parking in the area is prohibited under the order of the NGT. Despite this, the photographs indicate that vehicles are still being parked around the same area. This problem has to be addressed by proper management of traffic and creating adequate space for parking of public service vehicles. Merely treating it as a matter of law enforcement will not provide a long lasting solution. Ad hoc reactions to a deeper malaise will bring no relief to the residents, users of public transport and those providing public transport".
The Court noted that the National Green Tribunal had earlier passed a slew of directions for the resolution of problems affecting the area. However, the situation at the ground level has not changed substantially. 
"Merely treating the matter as a law enforcement issue, particularly in the area of traffic management, will not solve the problem. Experience shows that a direction by the Court to the law enforcement machinery may result in some action, even high-handed action for a few days, until the position is restored to the original status which becomes the new "normal". Hence, a comprehensive traffic management plan has to be drawn up to deal with the situation. This will be in addition to the directions issued by the NGT and will not detract from them or from the supervision by the NGT", the Court added.
Grievances of the petitioners
Advocate Gaurav Goel, appearing on behalf of the petitioners, submitted that the residents are suffering as a result of:
(i)Haphazard parking of three wheelers and other vehicles on public roads,including service roads;
(ii)The absence of adequate spaces for the parking of public service vehicles;
(iii)The pollution which is generated by buses plied by the Uttar Pradesh StateRoad Transport Corporation1;
(iv)Use of pressure horns by vehicles; and(v)The total absence of implementation by the law enforcement machinery which causes a serious hardship to pedestrians and residents of the area.
Senior Advocate Gharima Prasad, appearing on behalf of the UPSRTC, submitted that UPSRTC had acquired about nine acres of land for the setting up of a bus station. However, it appears that the front portion of the land was allotted in the recent past for the development of a mall. In the counter affidavit, it is stated that there is sufficient space for parking of buses and the existing available space within the area of nine acres is used for the purpose of parking and a workshop has also been set up for the purpose of maintenance. It has been stated in the counter affidavit and reiterated in the submissions that UPSRTC has 134 CNG buses which ply in Delhi-NCR and Ghaziabad region and as a matter of policy, an effort is being made to increase the number of CNG vehicles.

The Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has held that although different persons may react to a particular situation differently, mere refusal to repay a loan cannot in any way be considered to be an act of abetment to drive someone to commit suicide.
In this regard, Justice Rajnesh Oswal added,
"In order to constitute an offence of abetment, the act committed by the accused must be of such nature so that the deceased must be left with no other option but to take extreme step of ending his life."
This observation was made by the High Court in a petition filed under Section 482 CrPC for quashing the challan arising out of FIR dated August 14, 2010 registered with Police Station Nowabad, Jammu for offences under Section 306 (Abetment to commit Suicide) of the Ranbir Penal Code (RPC), pending before the 2nd Additional Sessions Judge, Jammu and the order by virtue of which the charge for commission of offence under Section 306 had been framed against the petitioner. 
Facts
The deceased Ghan Shyam, aged 35-36 years was a street vendor and his mother-in-law i.e. the present petitioner, was also in the same business. The deceased had allegedly given Rs. 73,000/- as loan to the petitioner for her business and was himself indebted to many people, as he had also borrowed money from them for his business. 
Being harassed by his lenders to clear his debts, on December 7, 2009, the deceased demanded from the petitioner the money, which he had given to given to her as a loan and it led to verbal altercation between the two which led to the deceased to say that if the petitioner did not clear her dues towards him, he would kill himself, as he is being harassed by the debtors. 
The petitioner had then told the deceased that at that moment she had no money to return and this prompted the deceased to take an extreme step of stabbing himself with a knife in the chest.
Submissions Before Court
Advocate Basit M. Keng for the petitioner submitted that there was not even an iota of evidence on record that the petitioner at any point of time abetted the commission of suicide by the deceased, as such, the proceedings pending before the trial Court were nothing but an abuse of process of law. 
AAG Aseem Sawhney for the State said that the trial Court had passed the order of framing the charges on the basis of evidence before the Court and the instant petition deserved to be dismissed.
Findings
The Court was of the opinion that the allegations against the petitioner do not constitute an offence under Section 306 RPC. In order to charge a person for commission of offences under Section 306 RPC, there must be evidence on record that the accused abetted the commission of suicide by the deceased., noted the Court.
"One can be charged for the offence of abetment only when he instigates any person to do that thing or intentionally or engages with one or more other person in conspiracy for the doing of that thing or intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing," it said.
Reliance was placed on the Supreme Courts' observations in Vaijnath Kondiba Khandke v. State of Maharashtra & Anr. where it was held that merely because a superior officer assigned work to his junior officer and took actions against him like stopping of his salary, he cannot be held to have a guilty mind or criminal intent, to attract offence under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code, for abetment of suicide.
In the instant case, the High Court observed,
"Though the different persons may react or respond to a particular situation differently but this court is of the considered opinion that mere refusal to repay the loan cannot in any way can be considered to be an act of abetment to drive the deceased to commit suicide."
It thus opined that the ingredients of offence under Section 306 of the RPC were absolutely lacking in the instant case and the trial Court had not considered this vital aspect of the case.
Accordingly, the impugned order was set aside and the petitioner was discharged for commission of offences under Section 306 RPC and the challan stood dismissed.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently called into question a bail order passed by the Addl. Sessions Judge, Faridkot, treating a regular bail petition as an anticipatory bail petition, even when the accused had been in the custody at the time of filing the bail plea.
Calling it a matter of 'serious concern', the Bench of Justice Jasgurpreet Singh Puri also sent the case file to the concerned Administrative Judge of District Faridkot for information and further necessary action, if so required, in accordance with the law.
The facts in brief
Essentially, the Court was dealing with the regular bail plea of one Sukhchain Singh @ Chaini in a case against him under Sections 420, 120-B of the Indian Penal Code.
He had been in custody from March 18, 2021, and since his regular bail plea (treating it to be an anticipatory bail plea) had been dismissed by the lower Court (the Court of Addl. Sessions Judge, Faridkot), therefore, he had moved the High Court
However, during the course of the hearing in the matter, the High Court noted that the Court of Addl. Sessions Judge, Faridkot had treated his regular bail plea as an anticipatory bail plea and therefore, the Court, on January 7, 2022, directed the District & Sessions Judge, Faridkot to file a report in this regard.
Filing a report before the Court, it was submitted by the  District & Sessions Judge, Faridkot that the regular bail of the petitioner was listed before Harbans Singh Lekhi, the Addl. Sessions Judge, Faridkot for disposal, wherein regular bail was sought.
The report further stated that it was specifically mentioned in the plea that the accused is in judicial custody, however, the report added, the Addl. Sessions Judge, Faridkot dismissed the same while considering it to be a plea filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.
The report also contained an explanation in this regard, wherein the concerned Judge had stated that due to the rush of work the mistake had occurred and he also assured that such mistakes wouldn't happen in the future.
However, at the concluding part of the report, the District & Sessions Judge, Faridkot submitted that the comments submitted by the Officer does not contain any legally justifiable reason in passing the order n question.
Against this backdrop, the High Court, perused the said order and noted that it raised serious concern and therefore, the Court directed that the matter be placed before the Administrative Judge of District Faridkot for information and further necessary action.
It may be noted that observing that no recovery is to be affected from the petitioner and that he wouldn't be able to influence any witness or may tamper with the evidence or may flee from justice if released on bail, the High Court has granted him bail in the matter.

The grant of leave to defend (with or without conditions) is the ordinary rule; and denial of leave to defend is an exception, the Supreme Court observed in a judgment in which it discussed the scope of Rule 3 of Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908.
The bench comprising Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari  observed that a prayer for leave to defend is to be denied in such cases where the defendant has practically no defence and is unable to give out even a semblance of triable issues before the Court.
ORDER XXXVII of the Code deals with Summary Procedure and Rule 3 thereof contains the procedure for the appearance of defendant. According to the said Rule, the defendants who enters appearance has to seek leave to defend such suit, and leave to defend may be granted to him unconditionally or upon such terms as may appear to the court or judge to be just. It also states that the leave to defend shall not be refused unless the court is satisfied that the facts disclosed by the defendant do not indicate that he has a substantial defence to raise or that the defence intended to be put up by the defendant is frivolous or vexatious:
In this case, the plaintiff filed the subject (summary) suit in terms of Order XXXVII CPC while stating itself to be a registered partnership firm manufacturing and supplying a wide variety of iron and steel products. The defendant No. 1 sought leave to defend with the following contentions, inter alia, that it had no privity of contract with the plaintiff because the purchase orders were issued only by the defendant No. 2; that the invoices in question were raised by the plaintiff in the name of the defendant No. 2; that neither the purchase orders nor the invoices were bearing the signatures of the defendant No. 1; and that all the dealings were between plaintiff and defendant No. 2, where no legal liability was to be discharged by defendant No. 1 and that the defendant No. 1 was rather a stranger to the contract in question. The 2nd defendant also filed a similar application seeking leave to defend. The Trial Court declined leave to defend to both the defendants observing that no triable issues were raised by the defendants. The High Court dismissed the appeal filed against this order.
The issues thus raised before the Apex Court in this appeal were (1) whether the plaintiff was entitled to maintain a summary suit under Order XXXVII CPC for the claim in question; and (2) whether the appellant-defendant No. 2 has rightly been declined the leave to defend?
Regarding the first issue, the bench noted that as per the plaint averment, the matter is based on written contract arising out of written purchase orders issued by the appellant on the instructions and on behalf of defendant No. 1; and the plaintiff had raised the invoices against such supplies under the purchase orders. Therefore, the contention against maintainability of the summary suit in terms of Order XXXVII CPC was rejected.
Referring to the Rule and also the judgments in Mechelec Engineers and Manufacturers v. Basic Equipment Corporation: AIR 1977 SC 577 and IDBI Trusteeship Services Ltd. v. Hubtown Ltd.: (2017) 1 SCC 56, the court made the following observations:
Grant of leave to defend (with or without conditions) is the ordinary rule; and denial of leave to defend is an exception.
It is at once clear that even though in the case of IDBI Trusteeship, this Court has observed that the principles stated in paragraph 8 of Mechelec Engineers' case shall stand superseded in the wake of amendment of Rule 3 of Order XXXVII but, on the core theme, the principles remain the same that grant of leave to defend (with or without conditions) is the ordinary rule; and denial of leave to defend is an exception. Putting it in other words, generally, the prayer for leave to defend is to be denied in such cases where the defendant has practically no defence and is unable to give out even a semblance of triable issues before the Court.
Trial Court is expected to balance the requirements of expeditious disposal of commercial causes on one hand and of not shutting out triable issues by unduly severe orders on the other
As noticed, if the defendant satisfies the Court that he has substantial defence, i.e., a defence which is likely to succeed, he is 18 entitled to unconditional leave to defend. In the second eventuality, where the defendant raises triable issues indicating a fair or bonafide or reasonable defence, albeit not a positively good defence, he would be ordinarily entitled to unconditional leave to defend. In the third eventuality, where the defendant raises triable issues, but it remains doubtful if the defendant is raising the same in good faith or about genuineness of the issues, the Trial Court is expected to balance the requirements of expeditious disposal of commercial causes on one hand and of not shutting out triable issues by unduly severe orders on the other. Therefore, the Trial Court may impose conditions both as to time or mode of trial as well as payment into the Court or furnishing security. In the fourth eventuality, where the proposed defence appear to be plausible but improbable, heightened conditions may be imposed as to the time or mode of trial as also of payment into the Court or furnishing security or both, which may extend to the entire principal sum together with just and requisite interest.
Even in such cases of doubts or reservations, denial of leave to defend is not the rule
Thus, it could be seen that in the case of substantial defence, the defendant is entitled to unconditional leave; and even in the case of a triable issue on a fair and reasonable defence, the defendant is ordinarily entitled to unconditional leave to defend. In case of doubts about the intent of the defendant or genuineness of the triable issues as also the probability of defence, the leave could yet be granted but while imposing conditions as to the time or mode of trial or payment or furnishing security. Thus, even in such cases of doubts or reservations, denial of leave to defend is not the rule; but appropriate conditions may be imposed while granting the leave. It is only in the case where the defendant is found to be having no substantial defence and/or raising no genuine triable issues coupled with the Court's view that the defence is frivolous or vexatious that the leave to defend is to be refused and the plaintiff is entitled to judgment forthwith. Of course, in the case where any part of the amount claimed by the plaintiff is admitted by the defendant, leave to defend is not to be granted unless the amount so admitted is deposited by the defendant in the Court.
 Denying the leave would be ordinarily countenanced only in such cases where the defendant fails to show any genuine triable issue and the Court finds the defence to be frivolous or vexatious.
Therefore, while dealing with an application seeking leave to defend, it would not be a correct approach to proceed as if denying the leave is the rule or that the leave to defend is to be granted only in exceptional cases or only in cases where the defence would appear to be a meritorious one. Even in the case of raising of triable issues, with the defendant indicating his having a fair or reasonable defence, he is ordinarily entitled to unconditional leave to defend unless there be any strong reason to deny the leave. It gets perforce reiterated that even if there remains a reasonable doubt about the probability of defence, sterner or higher conditions as stated above could be imposed while granting leave but, denying the leave would be ordinarily countenanced only in such cases where the defendant fails to show any genuine triable issue and the Court finds the defence to be frivolous or vexatious.
Examining the factual aspects of the case, the bench found that that the appellant defendant raised triable issues, particularly  concerning its liability and thus the defence of the appellant cannot be said to be frivolous or vexatious altogether. Allowing the appeal, the court granted leave to defend to the appellant-defendant.

The Rajasthan High Court, Jaipur Bench, has held that the use of salutations and titles such as "Raja", "Nawab" and "Rajkumar" in constitutional courts, all other Courts, tribunals, public offices of the State etc. is prohibited in terms of Articles 14, 18 and 363A of the Constitution of India. The court ordered that the said restriction will also apply in the public domain as well as public documents & public offices.
 Justice Sameer Jain, ruled,
 "In the light of above, this Court holds that in Constitutional Courts, all other Courts, Tribunals, public offices of the State etc., the use of salutation and titles is prohibited in terms of Articles 14 18 and 363A of the Constitution of India. The said restriction will also apply in the public domain as well as public documents & public offices."
The Court took up the issue on noticing that a respondent in the cause-title of a petition was addressed as "Raja Laxman Singh".  
The Court pursued Article 14, 18 and 363A of the Constitution of India and observed that any title awarded to the citizen of India by a Foreign State cannot be accepted nor used and no such title, other than the military or academic distinctions, can be conferred other than by the State.
 The Court also observed that in terms of Article 363A, the heredity titles of nobility being in conflict with the principles of equality and contrary to Article 14 cannot be used as prefixes or suffixes. In this regard, the court also relied on the cases of Raghunathrao Ganpatrao Vs. Union of India: 1994 [(Suppl.)1 SCC 191] and Balaji Raghavan Vs. Union of India [AIR 1996 SC 770].
 Further, the Court ordered the Registry to send copy of this order to the office of the Advocate General, Rajasthan;  Additional Solicitor General for the Union of India; Registrar General of the High Court Court as well as the Chief Secretary, Govt. of Rajasthan, Secretariat, Jaipur for necessary implementation, circulation and to issue necessary directions.
 The Court noted that the prohibition of titles in the public domain, public offices, Constitutional Courts or in public was not objected to by the petitioners, respondents or any other person. The court pointed out that ASG has also not filed any objection to the order passed by this Court and against the provisions of Articles 14, 18 and 363A of the Constitution of India as well as use of the titles which are unconstitutional.
 Moreover, the court directed the petitioners to file amended cause title at all respective places.
 Mr. M.S. Singhvi, Advocate General appearing for the State contended that in the light of Articles 14, 18 and 363A as well as in Raghunathrao Ganpatrao, the constitutional validity of 26th Amendment has been upheld.

A domestic violence complaint cannot be filed at a place a woman is only casually visiting and proceedings must be instituted at her temporary or permanent residence under section 27 of the Domestic Violence Act, the Bombay High Court said.

A domestic violence complaint cannot be filed at a place a woman is only casually visiting and proceedings must be instituted at her temporary or permanent residence under section 27 of the Domestic Violence Act, the Bombay High Court said.
 The court interpreted 'temporary residence' to mean the place an aggrieved person has temporarily decided to make their home and not a lodge or a guest house, meant for short visits. 
 Justice SK Shinde thus upheld a magistrate's order declining to entertain a woman's application under section 12 of the Domestic Violence Act for want of jurisdiction under section 27 as both parties were permanent residents of Hyderabad. 
 The court rejected the woman's argument that she was forced to 'flee' Hyderabad in September and since she had filed two non-cognizable complaints with the police in Mumbai, in October, 2021, the DV complaint was rightly filed in Mumbai.
 It held that the woman was not "temporarily" residing in Mumbai and no cause of action arose here. And the facts in the application and documents leads to indicate that Applicants' visit to Mumbai was 'casual visit' and does not imply definite intention to stay at a particular place.
 "Therefore, order passed by the Magistrate cannot be faulted with, either for wrong or non-exercise of jurisdiction. In fact, if liberal construction is placed upon the provision, made under Section 27 of the Act, as sought by the Applicants, it may lead to abuse of legal process of law, as aggrieved person may choose, any place, where she may be a casual visitor."
 The court relied heavily on the Delhi High Court judgements of Sharad Kumar Pandey Vs. Mamta Pandey and another judgement of Rabindra Nath Sahu & Another Vs. Smt. Susila Sahu 2016 in which the court held that temporary residence does not include residence in a lodge or hostel or residence at a place only for the purpose of filing a domestic violence case and further observed that this temporary residence must be also be a continuing residence from the date of acquiring residence till the application under Section 12 is disposed of.
 He also relied on Ramesh Mohanlal Bhutada Vs. State of Mahrashtra & Ors. 2011 regarding the interpretation of casual visit versus temporary visit. 
 Facts of the Case
 According to the woman's complaint, the couple married in 1993 at Hyderabad. Unable to bear the torture meted out to her by her husband and son she came to Mumbai on 27th September, 2021 and stayed as a guest in one of the hotels at Bombay-Kurla Complex and later shifted to hotel Grand Hyatt. 
 She filed an NC with the BKC police station on October 6 and 7, alleging she was constantly being watched and physically stalked. On October 12 she approached the Magistrate's court at Bandra seeking restraining orders against the husband and son in connection with their shared house hold, invoking sections 18 and 19 of the DV Act. 
 In a separate application she further sought ex-parte protection and residence orders under section 23 (2) of the DV Act. The magistrate refused relief on October 23. She approached the High Court under Article 226 and section 482 for quashing the magistrate's order. 
 Submission
 The petitioner's lawyer argued that the magistrate failed to consider that the two police complaints filed in Mumbai would constitute DV within the local limits of the court and were maintainable. The woman was forced to leave her shared household in compelling circumstances. Moreover, she was unlikely to get relief in Hyderabad as her husband in an influential person.
 Conversely the husband argued that there has to be compelling material to show the wife is residing in Mumbai and that she was not just visiting for a couple of days. 
 Observations
 The court held that prima facie the woman is well educated and financially sound. And considering her background it would be difficult to accept that she could not seek protection orders at Hyderabad or that she was forced to leave the Hyderabad and or she was intending to reside in Mumbai. 
 "On the contrary the chronology of the events do suggest, that the Applicant engineered the cause of action with an intention to file case and confer jurisdiction upon the Magistrate."
 The woman was continuously residing in Hyderabad since her marriage in 1993 till September 26-27 and had failed to take steps against the domestic violence caused to her till September, this year, it added while dismissing her plea.

The Supreme Court observed that unblemished or clean record of an employee is a significant factor while considering his/her suitability for promotion to a 'selection post'.
"A marred service record, though not an insurmountable bar, must carry some consequences, and it could be a comparative disadvantage in promotion for a selection post. The employer's preference for a person with a clean service record can be well appreciated", the bench comprising Justices KM Joseph and Hrishikesh Roy said.
Rama Negi initially joined service in the Cantonment Board, as a Steno Typist (equivalent to Senior Clerk), on 1.9.1995. Gopal Ram Arya entering service initially as a Junior Clerk on 16.7.1990, was promoted to the Post of Steno Typist/Senior Clerk on 9.7.1997. The Cantonment Board considered their candidature and resolved to recommend Rama Negi for promotion to the "selection post" of Office Superintendent, overlooking Gopal Ram Arya. Rama Negi was held to be senior as per the rule. This was done taking into account the criterion that "Persons in the feeder grades given the same grading, those in higher scales of pay will rank senior to those in the lower scale of pay". The Board also took into account that the Office Superintendent position required a service record without misconduct and that Gopal Ram Arya was a charge sheeted person, who had accepted the charges levelled against him. Gopal Ram Arya filed writ petition challenging the resolutions of the Board in favour of Rama Negi. Allowing the said writ petition, the High Court set aside these resolutions.
While considering the appeal filed by Rama Negi, the Apex Court noted that by virtue of her higher pay scale in the post of Accountant in the feeder cadre, the appellant deserves seniority.
"While rejecting the appellant's seniority claim in the feeder cadre by virtue of her higher salary vis-àvis the respondent no.3, the Division Bench, unfortunately, referred to the incorrect O.M. (dated 10.9.1985), overlooking the applicable O.M. (dated 12.12.1988) of the Ministry of Personnel. In this O.M., as noted earlier, it was clearly stated that the persons in the feeder cadre drawing higher scale will rank senior to those drawing lesser pay scale.", the court observed.
The court also noted that the unblemished service record of the appellant vis-à-vis the pending disciplinary proceedings against Gopal Ram Arya. (eventually resulting in penalty), were taken into account. While allowing the appeal, the bench observed:
All these circumstances in our opinion, weigh in favour of the appellant Rama Negi. Her Suitability for the selection post was attributable to two factors i.e. merit of the candidate and the inter-se seniority. Despite the difficulty in encapsulating the parameters for 'merit', a significant marker can be found in the unblemished record of the employee. A marred service record, though not an insurmountable bar, must carry some consequences, and it could be a comparative disadvantage in promotion for a selection post. The employer's preference for a person with a clean service record can be well appreciated

The Madras High Court recently directed the release of a man who was sentenced to ten years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1,00,000 rupees for consciously possessing 1.5 kg Heroin for transportation to Kuwait. The bench of Justice G Ilanthiraiyan observed that the appellant had carried the material believing it to be wheat flour and tamarind and not a prohibited substance.
 Though not in all cases, the carrier can plead absence of culpability, in the peculiar circumstances and facts of this case as narrated above, the knowledge of contraband in the Airbag cannot be attributed to the accused/appellant. Through his statement it is probablised that he had carried the parcel given by Venkateswara Rao, without knowing that it is a prohibited substance. By preponderance of probability, the accused had established the absence of knowledge. 
 The court thus set aside the order of conviction passed by the Special Court and directed refund of any fine amount paid. 
 The appellant was arrested by the authorities after getting telephonic information that one Venkateswara Rao of Chittor (since absconding), was planning to send 1 ½ Kg of Heroin by Fly Emirates Flight, through the appellant. The appellant contended that there was no culpable mental state as he carried the materials believing it to be wheat flour and tamarind given by the absconding accused. 
 The prosecution on the other hand submitted that the telephonic conversation between the appellant and the absconding accused would clearly prove that they were in frequent contact. 
 The court observed that the call records produced by the prosecution could not be accepted as these electronic evidence were not accompanied with certified under Section 65 B of the Evidence Act, 1872. At the same time, the officers who collected the call records were also not examined. Further no document was produced to prove that the cellular number belonged to the appellant. The trial Court erred in referring this inadmissible document to presume culpable mental state of the accused. 
 The court also noted that no effort had been taken to produce the absconding offender. Thus, the court held that the prosecution could not prove that the appellant was conscious of the presence of heroin in the parcel given to him. As a result, the court allowed the appeal.

The Delhi High Court has observed that once the employee is sent back to his parent department, it is the competent disciplinary authority of the parent organisation which can issue a charge sheet against the misconduct even though it has taken place in the borrowing department.
A division bench comprising of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad dismissed an appeal against a single judge order which had refused to grant relief to a man, employed as an Executive Director in the Power Finance Corporation Limited, challenging a chargesheet wherein he was proposed to be proceeded against in disciplinary action in accordance with the provisions made in Rules 28 and 30 of the Power Finance Corporation Limited (Conduct Discipline and Appeal) Rules.
In December 2014, the Assistant General Manager – HR, passed an order transferring the Appellant back to PFCL after which he was posted as Executive Director (Felicitation Group).
After the Petitioner was posted back to the company, a complaint was received by Central Vigilance Commission and the same was forwarded to the Ministry of Power. The Chief Vigilance Officer opined that the Petitioner should be placed under suspension, and disciplinary proceedings be initiated against him. 
Accordingly, disciplinary proceedings was initiated in October 2014 against the appellant. Resultantly, there was an effective consultation between PFCL and PFCCL while initiating disciplinary proceedings against the Appellant.
The competent Disciplinary Authority, after careful consideration of the response of the Appellant issued a chargesheet in March 2015. The Disciplinary Authority also appointed a Presiding Officer in the matter.
The enquiry proceedings continued upto August 2015, and the Appellant being aggrieved by the chargesheet and the disciplinary proceedings preferred a Writ Petition before High Court. 
The stay in respect of the departmental enquiry granted in September 2015 continued till May 18, 2022 till the matter was decided by the Single Judge. 
The single judge dismissed appellant's plea after observing that merely because the period of deputation of an employee may have come to an end, it would not divest the Disciplinary Authority of the company, Power Finance Corporation Limited (PFCL) in the present matter, from initiating an enquiry.
It also opined that the fact that the alleged misdemeanor was committed while the petitioner was serving on deputation does not detract from the Commission of misconduct.
In appeal, the division bench observed that the appellant projected a case that he was on deputation and after his repatriation to the parent department, by no stretch of imagination, the proceedings against him could have been initiated by PFCL (Parent Organization) for any event which took place while he was on deputation to PFCCL.
Noting that the chargesheet was issued after effective consultation between PFCL and PFCCL at the instance of the Central Vigilance Commission, the Court said:
"Therefore, the learned Single Judge was justified in holding that as the writ petitioner was an employee of PFCL, he was temporarily posted to PFCCL, the charge sheet was rightly issued by competent disciplinary authority even though the misconduct was committed by him while serving PFCCL."
"The statutory provisions quoted above makes it very clear that they relates to a period during which an employee is on deputation and would operate only during the tenure of service rendered by an employee in the borrowing entity. Once the employee is sent back to his parent department, it is the competent disciplinary authority of the parent organisation which can issue a charge sheet against the misconduct even though it has taken place in the borrowing department."
The Court thus concluded that since the charges were not vague and the chargesheet was issued by the competent disciplinary authority, the question of interference by High Court did not arise. 
"Resultantly, this Court does not find any reason to interfere with the order passed by the learned Single Judge. The appeal is accordingly dismissed," the Court ordered.

The Karnataka High Court has reiterated that maternity benefits such as allowing an employee to work from home, under section 5 (5) of the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act 2017, could be given only in case where the nature of work assigned to the women is such that it is possible for her to work from home.
 A single judge bench of Justice R Devdas while refusing relief to an employee working with Semi Conductor Technology and Applied Research Centre, ('STARC'), said,
 "Though reference is made to Section 5(5) of the Act, 1961, it is evident from the said provision that maternity benefits such as work from home after availing the maternity benefit could be given only in case where the nature of work assigned to the women is such that it is possible for her to work from home."
 Further it said, 
"In this regard, a specific decision is taken by the Organisation in its meeting held along with its employees on 31.03.2018, that the premises of the Organisation is sensitive and involved with risk due to usage of chemicals and toxic gases. The employees working with the Organisation are involved in research work which is both sensitive as well as complicated. Sensitive, in the nature of the work done, in the sense that the research is for the benefit of the Government of India which uses the facility in the defence fields and the research work will not be divulged to the public. This itself would prove that the nature of work assigned to the petitioner cannot be carried on from home."
 It added, "The respondents are also on record, in their statement of objections, that even during the period of lockdown, the top officials from the cadre of Deputy managers have been functioning from the premises itself."
 Case background:
 The Petitioner, working as a Senior Executive Engineer with the organisation, had approached the Court challenging two communications issued by the Respondent-organisation and sought a direction to the respondent to consider her representations for sanction of Child Care Leave with retrospective effect and to regularise the petitioner's salary and to release the salary withheld from 24.05.2021. By these communications the petitioner was called upon to join duties immediately and regularise the absence from 24.05.2021.
 Petitioners arguments:
 It was contended that the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 is applicable to the petitioner who is an employee of the respondent-Organisation which is a fully funded organisation controlled by the Government of India.
 Further, reliance was placed on Section 5(5) of the Act 1961, to contend that the petitioner should be allowed to carry on her work from home after availing the maternity benefit for the period as provided under the Act.
 Moreover, notifications have been issued by the Central Government, directing all the Public Sector Undertakings, which include the respondent- Organisation, to ensure that as far as possible, provisions should be made to lactating mothers to work from home, in view of the prevalence of COVID- 19 pandemic. Thus it is the duty of the respondent-Organisation to provide for Child Care Leave and to permit the petitioner to work from home, until it is declared by the Central Government/State Government that there is no need for its employees to work from home.
 Respondents opposed the plea:
 It was submitted that the benefit of the Maternity Benefit Act 1961, as applicable to the respondent-Organisation has been granted to the petitioner. However, in respect of Child Care Leave, in a meeting of the 14th STARC Employees Meet held on 31.03.2018, it was decided that providing crèche and Day Care facilities as per Maternity Benefit Act, 2017, was an option.
 It was also said that the respondent-Organisation cannot be equated to the Government of India and the facilities available to the Central Government employees, be it in the nature of providing maternity leave, Child Care Leave and other facilities cannot be automatically adopted to the respondent-Organisation.
 Court findings:
 The court found that the petitioner has not been able to point out to any specific provision of law or rules that would mandate the fourth respondent Organisation, to grant child care leave facility as is available to the Central Government employees.
 As regards the impugned communications issued by the Organisation to the petitioner, wherein she is warned about unauthorised absence and the consequence of willful disobedience, the Court said that the respondent-Organization is required to have a sympathetic view towards the petitioner, especially keeping in view serious waves of COVID-19 pandemic,.
 Following which it granted liberty to the petitioner to make fresh representations regarding the unauthorised absence and seek regularisation of the same. The court said, "As and when such representations are given by the petitioner, after she joins duty, the Organisation shall consider such representations sympathetically and pass orders in the light of the observations made hereinabove."

The Andhra Pradesh High Court recently transferred a suit from a Civil Court to the Commercial Court as the subject property in the suit was exclusively used for trade or commerce by a partnership firm, before its dissolution.
 Brief facts of the case
 The application was filed by the petitioner under Section 24 of Code of Civil Procedure to withdraw the suit from Senior Civil Judge's Court and transfer to Commercial Court for trial and disposal.
 The case of the petitioner was that based on the dissolution deed of the partnership firm, she had filed the suit seeking partition and separate possession of suit schedule property consisting of movable and immovable assets. It was stated that the petitioner inadvertently and by mistake filed the suit before the Senior Civil Judge's Court whereas the dispute raised in the suit is commercial dispute.
 In the counter affidavit, the respondent contended that the transfer petition was filed only to harass the respondents and delay the proceedings when it had almost reached the finality. Furthermore, the dispute in respect of immovable property cannot be transferred to a commercial court.
 Ruling of the Court
 The court observed that the dispute is a commercial dispute for specified value defined under Section 2(1)(c)(vii) [agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce] and 2(1)(c)(xv) [partnership agreements] of the Commercial Courts Act as the value of the suit is more than Rs. 3 lakhs and the property was exclusively used for trade and commerce in a partnership agreement. 
The suit has been filed based on the dissolution of partnership deed. The subject property was used for business of the partnership firm wherein the petitioner was a partner. Hence, the Commercial Court will have jurisdiction to adjudicate schedule property exclusively used for trade or commerce. 
 The court thus allowed the petition finding it just and appropriate to transfer the suit.

The Meghalaya High Court on Monday granted bail to a teenager in a sexual assault case lodged against him under the provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) after taking into consideration that the minor victim and the accused were in a romantic relationship and that there was consensual sexual intercourse. 
Justice W Diengdoh observed, 
"On perusal of the records, particularly the statement of the victim and the accused, prima facie it is apparent that there is a romantic relationship between the two and that the sexual act involved between them was one of consensual, notwithstanding the fact that in the case of an alleged victim being a minor, consent has no legal validity, however, this aspect of the matter cannot be lost sight of while a plea for grant of bail is being considered by the court." 
The Court further observed that there is 'no denial of the fact' that a romantic relationship existed between the accused and the alleged victim resulting in the lodging of the FIR by the complainant who is the mother of the alleged victim. It is a matter of evidence as to whether the alleged act constitutes sexual assault as per the provision of the POCSO Act, the Court stated further. 
Reliance was also placed by the Court on the Madras High Court judgment in Vijayalakshmi & Anr. v. State wherein it was held that the POSCO Act did not intend to penalise teenagers in a relationship who consented to sexual acts between them. 
In the instant case, a case was registered against the accused under Sections 5 and 6 (penetrative and aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the POCSO Act. It was contended that the accused and the victim were stated to be in a romantic relationship with each other. 
Counsel for the accused Advocate CB Sawian submitted that the accused is a teenager and is therefore incapable of understanding the consequences of his actions. Accordingly, it was contended that keeping him incarcerated with other inmates, some of whom may be harden criminals will have an impact on his future career. 
It was argued further that the POCSO Act has been enacted to prevent cases of sexual assault on children, however, the Act does not contemplate punishment of teenagers who are involved in romantic love. It was also pointed out that the accused has been in judicial custody for almost 11 months, while the POCSO Act stipulates that cases have to be disposed of in a year. 
On the other hand, Additional Advocate General B Bhattarcharjee, opposing the bail application, submitted that the accused is an adult who is booked with a serious charge. It was also submitted that the provisions of the POCSO Act does not distinguish between the severity of the offence whether it is a result of romantic love or otherwise. Whether he is 19 years or 40 years would make no difference in the eyes of the law, it was contended further.
Pursuant to the perusal of the record, the Court noted that investigation was complete and that the charge sheet had been filed. Thereafter the Special Court (POCSO) had also taken cognizance of the charge sheet and that the case is now at the stage of evidence, it was noted further. 
"The contention of the learned AAG on the applicability of the relevant provision of the POCSO Act and the severity of the offence involved would be subject to the appreciation of evidence adduced in the case. However, this Court while taking into the account the nature and gravity of the alleged offence has also to consider other aspects as far as consideration for grant of bail is concerned", the Court opined further. 
Accordingly, Court allowed the bail plea on a personal bond of ₹20,000 with two sureties of like amount. The accused was directed  to not tamper with the case witnesses or abscond/leave the jurisdiction of the trial court without prior permission.

The Tripura High court recently directed the State Government to pay a sum of Rs. 2,50,000/- to a 28-year-old woman who was subjected to custodial torture in October 2021.
The bench of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice S. G. Chattopadhyay was dealing with a suo moto case instituted by the High Court on a news report regarding the custodial torture inflicted on one Priyashi Datta (Debnath).
The case in brief
Before the Court, the State-counsel had contended that there was no proof of custodial torture on the victim in police lockup. It was argued that she was called to the Police station for interrogation in connection with a theft case and during interrogation, she fell ill for which, she was taken to AGMC and GBP hospital where she was given adequate medical treatment. The State counsel submits that the newspaper report about the custodial torture of the woman in police lockup is not true.
On the other hand, the amicus curiae submitted that as per the statement of the victim, she was called to the police station on the basis of a false and unverified allegation of theft, and therein she was physically tortured in the name of interrogation
It was further submitted that as per the medical report of the Medical Superintendent, AGMC and GBP hospital, Agartala, it has been clearly stated that abrasions were found over both buttocks of the victim after she was brought to the hospital on 26.10.2021 with a history of physical assault. 
Consequently, Amicus argued that the materials available on record are sufficient to establish the fact that the victim woman was beaten in police custody, as a result of which, she suffered those injuries, and thus, it was urged that she be provided with adequate compensation besides issuing other directions as the Court may deem fit and appropriate.
Court's observations
Against this backdrop, taking into account the facts and circumstances presented before it, the Court concluded that merely on the basis of telephonic information received from a neighbor of the victim about her involvement in a theft case, police called her to the police station even without registering a case and without verifying the facts. 
The Court further noted that from the medical reports available on record, it was established that she was physically assaulted during interrogation in police custody. The Court also stressed how the police officers are under obligation to protect the human rights of a person in custody and prevent all forms of atrocities against him/her.
The Court further observed that the victim was not formally arrested by police but, undisputedly, she was detained in police custody for a considerable period of time for the purpose of interrogation, and therefore, she was entitled to all the safeguards provided under the guidelines issued in the case of D. K. Basu vs. State of West Bengal (1997) 1 SCC 416, however, she was deprived of those safeguards and she was tortured and maltreated in police custody.
Consequently, the Court found the victim to be entitled to monetary compensation for the wrongs done to her and directed the State-respondents to pay a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- (Two Lakh Fifty Thousand) to the victim Priyashi Datta (Debnath). 
Case title - Court on its own motion v. The State of Tripura and others [WP(C) (PIL) No.25 of 2021]

The Karnataka High Court has said that a mortgagee (secured creditor/Bank) gets rights over the compensation amount to be disbursed when the property which is mortgaged with it is acquired by the state government, as per Section 73 of the Transfer of Property Act.
A single judge bench of Justice Krishna S Dixit allowed a petition filed by M/s D C B Bank Limited and directed Special Land Acquisition Officer (SLAO) to refer the claim of Petitioner – Bank forthwith to the Court of I Additional District Judge, Chitradurga, with all necessary papers, with intimation to the Petitioner. The Court after notice to all the stakeholders, shall adjudge the claim of Petitioner-Bank, within an outer limit of one year.
The bench said “Where the mortgaged property has been acquired, the amended provisions of Section 73 of the Transfer of Property Act Act becomes invokable.” 
It added “This section is an instance of incorporation application of the “doctrine of substituted security”, viz that the mortgagee is, for the purpose of his security, entitled in lieu of only to the mortgaged property, to anything that is substituted for it. If, by a process of law or by a compelling situation sanctioned by law, the security given to a creditor for the repayment of debt is changed into something other than the property, the mortgagee gets rights over the substituted security namely, the changed one i.e., the compensation or the like.” 
The bank had approached the court after its representation given to the SLAO was not considered. The petitioner contended that “Mortgage is one of the five traditional modes of transfer recognized by the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and therefore, his client has a vested interest in the subject property, which entitles it to the payment of compensation for its appropriation to loan account of the borrower. She expresses anguish against the 2nd Respondent in not considering her client’s Representation in terms of Sections 64 & 73 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.” 
The authorities opposed the petition submitting that petitioner can approach the Civil Court for the redressal of its grievance since disputable fact matrix emanates from the case papers, writ remedy not being much suitable.
On going through the records the bench said “Counsel for the Petitioner is more than justified in heavily banking upon the provisions of Section 64 of the 2013 Act to contend that her client being the person interested has sent a Representation in terms of which the SLAO ought to have referred the dispute to the jurisdictional court, for adjudication since the mortgage is shifted to the compensation in lieu of the mortgaged property.” 
Further it said “It hardly needs to be stated that this provision is substantially texted on par with Section 30 of the erstwhile Land Acquisition Act, 1894.” 
Noting that the State Government being the appropriate Government has designated the I Additional District Judge of every District as & to be the “Authority” inter alia for the adjudication of disputes of the kind, the SLAO ought to have referred the matter to the said Judge for adjudication.
The bench held “This having not been done, there is justiciable right availing to the Petitioner to seek appropriate writ for its enforcement. In matters like this, driving the mortgagee to the ordinary Civil Court would only amount to the Writ Court shirking its responsibility to do justice in plain cases of the kind.” 
Allowing the petition the bench clarified that “Till the Reference is decided, the compensation amount shall be kept in the interest earning scheme of some Nationalised Bank as a short time deposit of one year and that, the compensation shall follow its outcome.”

The High Court of Madhya Pradesh recently held that a Tehsildar, alleged to have misused her position by extending undue benefit to her husband as well as her servant was not entitled for protection under the Judges Protection Act, 1985.
 The division bench of Chief Justice Ravi Malimath and Justice V.K. Shukla was dealing with a criminal revision, wherein the Applicant was challenging the order passed by the lower court, whereby she was denied protection under the Judges Protection Act, 1985 ("Act of 1985").
 As per the prosecution story, a complaint was filed against the Applicant that she misused her post and office of Tehsildar to auction a property at a price much lower than the guideline value. The property was sold to her servant, whereas her husband was the witness. Accordingly, she was charged U/S 13(1)(d) and 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act and U/S 169, 120-B IPC. While framing the charges, the lower court rejected her plea for seeking protection under the Act of 1985.
 Assailing the impugned order, the Applicant argued that being a Revenue Officer, she held a status of Judge as defined U/S 2 of the Act of 1985, by virtue of Section 31 of Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code. She further contended that being empowered by law to give a definitive judgment in any legal proceeding, she was entitled to additional protection U/S 3(1) of the Act of 1985.
 The Applicant asserted that provisions of the Act of 1985 go on to show that for the purpose of seeking protection under the statute, the person concerned has to show that the cause of action for filing prosecution against them relates to something done by them while exercising adjudicatory jurisdiction i.e., to show that they are deciding the lis as Judicial Officer.
 Examining the provisions under the Act of 1985, the Court noted that Section 3(1) not only protects Judges, as defined U/S 2, from civil or criminal proceedings for any act, thing or word committed, done or spoken by them when, or in the course of, acting in the discharge of their official duty or function, but also extends the protection to them for any act, thing or word committed, done or spoken by him while purporting to act in the discharge of his official or judicial duty or function. However, the Court observed that any act, which is not done in the discharge of their judicial duty, is not covered U/S 3(1).
 Considering the facts of the case, the Court noted that the lower court rightly rejected the plea of the Applicant for grant of protection under the Act of 1985-
 In the present case, the allegation against the present applicant is for misusing of her post and office by extending undue benefit to her husband as well as to her servant, we are of the considered opinion that Trial Court rightly held that the present applicant was not entitled for protection under the Judges Protection Act, 1985.
 With the aforesaid observations, the Court held that the impugned order did not suffer from any illegality and accordingly, the criminal revision was dismissed.
 Case Title: DEEPALI JADHAV v. THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH AND ANR.

The Supreme Court observed that the reservation is an exception to the general rule of equality and thus cannot be regarded as basic feature of the Constitution.
One of the main defence raised by the Centre was that the 103rd Constitutional amendment is enabling, and confer power upon the state, to make special provisions and reservations, based on the economic criterion – thus, cannot violate the basic structure.
The majority judgment by Justice Dinesh Maheshwari held thus and added that 'being in the nature of enabling provision only, cannot be regarded as an essential feature of that nature whose modulation for the sake of other valid affirmative action would damage the basic structure of the Constitution'. The judge observed:
The provisions contained in Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India, providing for reservation by way of affirmative action, being of exception to the general rule of equality, cannot be treated as a basic feature. Moreover, even if reservation is one of the features of the Constitution, it being in the nature of enabling provision only, cannot be regarded as an essential feature of that nature whose modulation for the sake of other valid affirmative action would damage the basic structure of the Constitution. Therefore, the doctrine of basic structure cannot be invoked for laying a challenge to the 103rd Amendment. [Para 101]
Referring to some essays on the Basic Structure Doctrine, Justice JB Pardiwala observed:
"I am of the view as Prof. Satya Prateek rightly puts that the enabling provisions, varying enforcement mechanisms and the State opinion on backwardness, reservation, adequate representation etc., in any circumstances cannot be recognised as the fundamental or basic structure of the Constitution. By their very nature, they are bound to change, with time, location and circumstances. On the other hand, the fundamental tenets or the core principles of the Constitution are foundational – they are at the core of its existence. They are seminal to the Constitution's functioning. The Constitution retains its existence on these foundations as they preserve the Constitution in its essence. This is not to mark out the possibilities of structural adjustments in the foundations with time. The foundations may shift, fundamental values may assume a different meaning with time but they would still remain to be integral to the constitutional core of principles, the core on which the Constitution would be legitimately sustained."
According to minority opinion authored by Justice S. Ravindra Bhat it is inaccurate to say that provisions that enable, exercise of power, would not violate the basic structure of the Constitution.
"The enabling provision in question's basic premise, its potential to overbear the constitutional ethos, or overcome a particular value, would be in issue. The court's inquiry therefore, cannot stop at the threshold, when an enabling provision is enacted. Its potential for violating the basic structure of the Constitution is precisely the power it confers, on the legislature, or the executive. To borrow a powerful simile from a dissenting opinion in a decision of the United States Supreme Court, that upheld broad use of emergency power, to incarcerate thousands of US citizens, such enabling powers, if left alone, can "lie(s) about like a loaded weapon" with its potential to destroy core constitutional values".
The judge added that the the fact that impugned amendments have introduced provisions which are merely enabling, does not protect it from basic structure scrutiny. 
"To view a newly added provision as only "enabling" can be an oversimplification in constitutional parlance. The court's concern is not with the conferment of power per se, but with the width of it, lack of constitutional control, and the direct impact it can have on principles constituting the basic structure.", Justice Bhat observed.

[From Majority Judgment by Dinesh Maheshwari J [ Bela M. Trivedi J and J B Pardiwala J concurring ]
Constitution of India, 1950 ; Articles 14, 15, 16 - Constitution (103rd Amendment) Act, 2019 - Constitution validity of EWS Quota upheld - Reservation structured singularly on economic criteria does not violate any essential feature of the Constitution of India and does not cause any damage to the basic structure of the Constitution of India - Exclusion of the classes covered by Articles 15(4), 15(5) and 16(4) from getting the benefit of reservation as economically weaker sections, being in the nature of balancing the requirements of non-discrimination and compensatory discrimination, does not violate Equality Code and does not in any manner cause damage to the basic structure of the Constitution of India. (Para 102)
Constitution of India, 1950 ; Articles 14, 15, 16 - Reservation for economically weaker sections of citizens up to ten per cent. in addition to the existing reservations does not result in violation of any essential feature of the Constitution of India and does not cause any damage to the basic structure of the Constitution of India on account of breach of the ceiling limit of fifty per cent. because, that ceiling limit itself is not inflexible and in any case, applies only to the reservations envisaged by Articles 15(4), 15(5) and 16(4) of the Constitution of India. (Para 102)
Constitution (103rd Amendment) Act, 2019 - The 103rd Constitution Amendment cannot be said to breach the basic structure of the Constitution by (1) permitting the State to make special provisions, including reservation, based on economic criteria (2) permitting the State to make special provisions in relation to admission to private unaided institutions (3) in excluding the SEBCs/OBCs/SCs/STs from the scope of EWS reservation.

Punjab and Haryana High Court has dismissed a petition filed by the mother of a 3 year old, seeking issuance of a writ of habeas corpus to get the custody of the minor son from alleged illegal confinement of her husband and in-laws."Custody of the father as a natural guardian cannot be said to be illegal or unlawful and therefore, it would not be appropriate to issue a writ of...
Punjab and Haryana High Court has dismissed a petition filed by the mother of a 3 year old, seeking issuance of a writ of habeas corpus to get the custody of the minor son from alleged illegal confinement of her husband and in-laws."Custody of the father as a natural guardian cannot be said to be illegal or unlawful and therefore, it would not be appropriate to issue a writ of habeas corpus in 
favour of the petitioner," it said.
The bench comprising 
Justice Sant Parkash
 further held that while making orders for the appointment of guardians of minors, the most important consideration should be given to the welfare of the minor. Court further added that the legal rights of the mother must be understood subject to provisions of Section 7 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890.
 Under Section 7 of the Act, the Court should be guided by the sole consideration of the welfare of the minor, and what would be for the welfare of the minor must necessarily depend upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
 The petitioner and respondent got married in 2014 and had 2 children out of this wedlock. Due to a matrimonial dispute, they started living separately and the elder child was living with the mother while the younger child was living with the father. It is the case of the petitioner that her minor son is taken illegally by her husband and in-laws who are habitual offenders as more than 198 FIRs under the NDPS Act are registered against them. She made a complaint before the Police, SHO, and DSP but no action was taken. 
 After considering rival submissions made by the parties, the court held that a case pertaining to custody of a minor child is to be decided on the sole and predominant criterion of the interest and welfare of the minor. 
 It is a settled principle of law that whenever a question arises before a court pertaining to the custody of a minor child, the matter is to be decided not on considerations of the legal rights of parties but on the sole and predominant criterion of what would best serve the interest and welfare of the minor. If welfare of the child so demands then technical objections cannot come in the way.
 The court noted that the custody of a minor child below five years is ordinarily with the mother.
 In view of the above referred judicial precedents, it has emerged that in view of proviso to Section 6(a) of the HMG Act, the custody of a minor child who has not completed the age of five years shall ordinarily be with the mother.
 Court further noted that the duty of a court while exercising its jurisdiction under parens patraie in custody matters is more onerous. Sentiments and the welfare of the minor are supreme considerations and cannot be ignored.
 Regarding the facts of the instant case, the court stated that the mother being a natural guardian of her minor child has a preferential right to claim custody but the utmost consideration before the Court is the well-being of the child and not the legal right of a party. 
 It is true that mother being a natural guardian of a minor child has a preferential right to claim custody of her son. However, the utmost consideration before this Court is the well being of the minor and not the legal right of a particular party.
 Stating further that none of the parent's right to the custody of their minor child is absolute, the court concluded that custody of the father as a natural guardian is not illegal or unlawful.
 Taking into consideration the provisions of law and the factual matrix which is disputed, I am of the opinion that custody of the father as a natural guardian cannot be said to be illegal or unlawful and therefore, it would not be appropriate to issue a writ of habeas corpus in favour of the petitioner.
 After noting that that minor child has not been kept in illegal custody, the court dismissed the instant petition of habeas corpus finding it sans merit.

The Supreme Court has observed in a judgment that revenue record is not a document of title. The Court added that a lessee would not be entitled to any right on the land only on the basis of an entry in the revenue record.
 The bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian was hearing an appeal against the High Court's order wherein the Court had set aside the order dated July 8, 2004, passed by the Deputy Director of Consolidation, Lucknow, wherein, the revenue entry of Khasra Nos. 1576 and 1738 was ordered to be corrected in the name of Department of Forest and the claim of rival claimants were set aside.
The claimants had asserted rights over the forest land on the basis of entries in the revenue record.
The Court rejected such claim observing as follows in the case Prabhagiya Van Adhikari Awadh Van Prabhag V. Arun Kumar Bhardwaj (Dead) Thr. Lrs. 
 *The revenue record is not a document of title. Therefore, even if the name of the lessee finds mention in the revenue record but such entry without any supporting documents of creation of lease contemplated under the Forest Act is inconsequential and does not create any right, title or interest over 12 bighas of land claimed to be in possession of the lessee as a lessee of the Gaon Sabha".
 Factual Background 
 The Governor in the exercise of powers under Section 117 of the UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 had issued a notification on October 11, 1952, under Section 4 of the Act as per which 162 acres of area in Village Kasmandi Khurd was not to vest with the Gaon Samaj.
 On November 23, 1955 a notification was issued u/s 4 of the Forest Act, 1927 for inviting objections in respect of the land that formed a part of the notification and pursuant to this a proclamation was carried out on April 28, 1968 u/s 6 of the Forest Act, 1927.
 The Gaon Sabha (local management committee) on May 15, 1966, and on December 26, 1966 put lessee into possession of 7 bighas and 5 bighas of land respectively from Khasra No 1576. The Forest Department challenged the grant of lease before the Sub Divisional Officer, Lucknow but remained unsuccessful vide order dated December 19, 1969. The Department however succeeded before the Additional Commissioner, Lucknow on July 22, 1970. Although the Board of Revenue dismissed the lessee's revision but on July 22, 1970, it decided to take a fresh decision after impleading the local management committee who had granted lease to the lessee on Goan Sabha's behalf.
 When the six yearly Khatuni was prepared for the period 1380 fasli to 1388 fasli, the barren land which could be made cultivable including Khasra no. 1576 was recorded to be transferred name of Gaon Sabha village Kasmandi Khurd to Department of Forest. When the six yearly khatauni for the fasli year 1395 to 1400 was issued Khasra no. 1576 was transferred to the forest as a protected forest. Since the lessee's name appeared for the first time in khatauni prepared for the year 1407 fasli till 1412 fasli , for rectifying the revenue record from the lessee's name to that of the Forest Department, the Forest Department initiated proceedings under the Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1934 which were dismissed on July 22, 1993.
 Pursuant to the dismissal of an appeal against the order dated July 22, 1993, the Deputy Director Consolidation in revision directed for correction of the revenue entry of Khasra Nos 1576 and 1738 in the name of Forest Department and set aside the claim of rival claimants.
 The Allahabad High Court on November 30, 2005, set aside the order dated July 8, 2004, passed by the Deputy Director of Consolidation.
 Aggrieved, the Forest Department (Prabhagya Van Adhikari Awadh Van Prabhag) approached the Top Court.
 Counsel's Submission
 Relying on the notification dated October 11, 1952, counsel appearing for the Department, submitted that the notification had the effect of vesting all the rights, title and interest in the State of Uttar Pradesh. Relying on section 117 of the Abolition Act as per which the State could transfer the lands by a general or special order including forests to Gaon Sabha and other local authorities, the counsel contended that the land was not subject to any special or general orders and thus the land vested unequivocally with the State.
 He further contended that the State could only issue a notification u/s 4 of the Forest Act, 1927 if it had proprietary rights over such land or if it was entitled to produce thereof.
 It was also his contention that the lessees were not in possession of any part of the land at the time of issuance of such notification and they have not claimed rightly any right over the property and neither the Sabha claimed any right in the land measuring 162 acres notified in the notification.
 Counsel(s) for the lessee's and Gaon Sabha submitted that the details of the land in respect of which the notification u/s 4 of the Forest Act was issued were not mentioned. It was also their contention that the notification u/s 4 was vague since it did not comply with the conditions and Khasra No 1576 was only mentioned in the proclamation published u/s 6 of the Forest Act.
 Supreme Court's Observations 
 With regards to counsel for lessee's contention that the notification dated November 23, 1955 did not comply with the requirements u/s 4 of the Forest Act, the bench after relying on explanation 1 of Section 4 of the Forest Act observed that the notification had boundaries on all four sides mentioned.
 "There is no other requirement under Section 4 of the Forest Act. It is only Section 6 of the Forest Act which needs to specify the situation and limits of the proposed forest. In terms of such clause (a) of Section 6 of the Forest Act, the details of khasra numbers which were part of 162 acres find mention in the proclamation so published," bench noted in its judgement authored by Justice Hemant Gupta while observing that the notification satisfied all the procedural requirements.
 To deal with the counsel for lessee's contention with regards to publication of final notification u/s 20 of the Forest Act, 1927 the bench while referring to judgement in State of Uttarakhand and Ors v Kumaon Stone Crusher observed that,
 "A reading of Section 20 of the Forest Act does not show that for a reserved forest, there is a requirement of publication of notification but no time limit is prescribed for publication of such notification under Section 20. Therefore, even if notification under Section 20 of the Forest Act has not been issued, by virtue of Section 5 of the Forest Act, there is a prohibition against acquisition of any right over the land comprised in such notification except by way of a contract executed in writing by or on behalf of the Government. Since no such written contract was executed by or on behalf of the State or on behalf of the person in whom such right was vested, therefore, the Gaon Sabha was not competent to grant lease in favour of the appellant."
 The Top Court thereafter while observing that the findings of the High Court were clearly erroneous set aside the order and observed that the land vested in the Forest Department by virtue of notification published under the statute and that it was the lessee who had to assert the title on the forest land by virtue of an agreement in writing by a competent authority but no such agreement in writing was produced.

Revenue Record Entries Do Not Confer Title To A Property, Reiterates SC [Read Judgment] 

The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, observed that the direction in Secretary, Ministry of Consumer Affairs v. Dr.Mahindra Bhaskar Limaye And Ors. that, the Central and State Governments are required to make certain amendments to the Consumer Protection Rules, 2020 pertaining to the appointment process at the Consumer Dispute fora is to be carried out on an urgent basis, preferably within 3 months’ time. 
A Bench comprising Justice S.K. Kaul, Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Justice Aravind Kumar passed the directions in a public interest litigation challenging the inaction of the Governments in appointing President, Members and Staff of District and State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commissions across the country. It noted that the recent judgment in Secretary, Ministry of Consumer Affairs v. Dr.Mahindra Bhaskar Limaye And Ors. has an impact on the constitutional validity of certain rules concerning the appointment process, which might be relevant to the present case. 
In Secretary, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, the Supreme Court had upheld the decision of the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench)to quash the provisions of Consumer Protection Rules, 2020, framed by Central Government u/s 101 of Consumer Protection Act 2019, which prescribe a minimum professional experience of 20 years and 15 years for adjudicating members to the State consumer commissions and District forums respectively and which did away with the requirement of a written exam for appointment. The judgment held that persons having ten years of professional experience should be considered eligible for appointment as members of Consumer Commissions.It mandated that the future appointments to be done in compliance with the modified rules. In view of the same it directed the States and the Centre to modify their rules as per the order. The said judgment also had issued directions relating to selection process, by mandating a written exam.
In today's hearing, Senior Advocate, Gopal Sankaranarayanan (Amicus Curiae), informed the bench about this judgment. 
“The Central Government and State Governments have been directed to amend rules for the appointment process and we expect the needful to be done on an urgent basis, preferably within 3 months’ time.”, the bench then noted.
Mediation Cells 
The Amicus Curiae, Gopal Sankaranarayanan apprised the Bench that 23 states have notified and set up Mediation Cells for which 1 month’s time was granted; 7 states have notified and set up but empanelment was not done. The Bench noted that it expected the remaining process to be completed at the earliest on an urgent basis. It further observed - 
“Establishment of mediation cells is still under process in the UT of J&K, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman And Diu and Ladakh. We expect the States who have not complied yet to do so in 1 month from today.”
The Counsel appearing for the NCT of Delhi informed the Bench that in Delhi there is a Dispute Resolution Society which takes care of the need of mediation in 11 centres. At present the issue of whether the DDRS can take care of consumer disputes as well is pending before the Delhi High Court in a writ petition. However, the Bench indicated that in the interim there should be a mediation mechanism for consumer disputes in NCT of Delhi. 
Utilisation Certificate
On the last date of hearing, the Court had marked three States (West Bengal, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh) which were responsible for 46% of the total un-utilised funds. On Tuesday, the Amicus informed the Bench that as on 06.03.2023, State of Uttar Pradesh has used INR 36.05 crore out of the un-utilised funds of INR 53.55 crore. The Senior Counsel appearing for the State of West Bengal and Rajasthan submitted that the respective States have also substantially utilised the un-utilised funds. However, since their affidavits were not on record, the Bench noted - 
“State of Rajasthan submits that something was filed yesterday which shows decline in utilisation certificate. Insofar as the State of West Bengal is concerned it is submitted….10% balance remains from the original amount. The aforesaid may be looked into…”
Presidents of State Commission Chairperson To be Designated as Head of the Department
By way of the last order, the Bench noted that some of the Presidents had not been notified as Head of the Department and granted one month’s time to the concerned States to take necessary steps. On Tuesday, the Bench was informed that 13 States were in non-compliance of the said direction. Accordingly, the Bench granted another 4 weeks’ time to comply with the order, failing which the Secretaries of the respective States would be present before the Court on the next date of hearing. 
Presidents of the State Commissions As Disciplinary Authority 
On the last occasion, the Apex Court had directed that the States comply with the mandate of notifying the President of the State Commission as the disciplinary authority qua the staff of the Commission. That Amicus apprised the Bench that 19 States have appointed Presidents as the Disciplinary Authority. The Bench directed that the States that are yet to comply with the directions are granted 4 weeks’ time as last opportunity, failing which, the Secretaries of the respective States would be required to remain present before the Court on the next date of hearing. 
Vacancy of Registrar at NCDRC 
On the last date of hearing, the Bench had flagged the issue of absence of Registrar in NCDRC. Appearing before the Bench, on Tuesday, Additional Solicitor General, Balbir Singh informed it that the appointment rules had been issued in the month of March and the circular for vacant posts is to be issued shortly. He added that it is expected that the process would be completed within 3 months. It was pointed out by the Amicus that there are 4 prospective vacancies for members and one for Chairperson. The ASG assured the Bench that the process is on for the 5 posts (4 prospective and one existing vacancy) for members and one for the Chairperson.

The Allahabad High Court recently denied bail to Kairana MLA Nahid Hasan in connection with a case of criminal intimidation. The Bench of Justice Samit Gopal denied him bail looking to his criminal history and the order-sheet of the trial court showing that he avoided appearing before the trial court.
Essentially, an FIR was registered under Section 406, 504, 506, I.P.C against Hasan and one Nawab by one Shahjahan alleging therein that her husband had given a Bolero pick-up vehicle of which he was the registered owner on rent in the year 2015 to co-accused Nawab.
Case in brief
It was further alleged that Nawab did not pay the required monthly rent of the same and therefore, finally on 22.04.2019, when they came to know that the vehicle was standing in the premises of the applicant (Hasan), both the first informant and her husband went there to see the vehicle and that is when they got a phone call from the applicant (Hasan) who threatened them and told them to go back. 
It was thier case that they were also abused and threatened for life and even threat was extended that they would be got involved in false cases. Her husband due to fear went to Police Station Kotwali after which the Inspector in-charge was sent to the place where the vehicle was standing and then again a threatening call was received and there were abuses received by the first informant and the threat of life was extended. 
Hasan's counsel argued before the court that the incident is a petty offence and even otherwise as per the prosecution case, the vehicle was given on rent to coaccused Nawab. The applicant was not entrusted with the vehicle.
On the other hand, the state argued that the applicant had been avoiding appearance in the Court in spite of service of summons and that there are good chances of him not co-operating with the trial in the instant case, and that he may abscond and tamper with evidence and threaten the witnesses in spite of the fact that he is a public representative
Court's observations 
After having heard the counsel for the parties and perusing the record, the Court observed that although as per the prosecution case, the vehicle in question was not given to the applicant by the first informant and her husband, but the said vehicle was recovered from the premises of the applicant. 
Further, the Court noted that he has criminal history of 17 cases and as per the the order-sheet of the trial court, in spite of service of summons on 03.03.2021, the applicant kept on avoiding appearance before the trial court. It was only when he was arrested in another case he was then taken on remand in this case on 29.01.2022. 
"In these circumstances, as of now, looking to the criminal history of the applicant and the order-sheet of the trial court which shows the absondence of the applicant and the apprehension of the applicant not co-operating in the trial and their being an apprehension of his tampering with evidence and threatening the witnesses, this Court is not inclined to release the applicant on bail. The applicant may renew his prayer of bail after the evidence of first informant and her husband has been recorded by the trial court in the present case," the Court observed as it denied him the benefit of bail.

While stressing that during the trial of a case, the testimonies of the interested witnesses have to be examined with extra care and caution, the Allahabad High Court today dismissed an appeal filed by the informant of the case challenging the acquittal order of the trial court in an attempt to murder case.
Finding serious discrepancies in the statements of the interested witnesses in the case, the Bench of Justice Vivek Kumar Birla and Justice Subhash Vidyarthi upheld the October 2014 judgment and order passed by the ASJ, Mahoba acquitting two accused charged for offences under Sections 387, 307/34, 452, 323/34 and 427 IPC.
The case in brief 
Essentially, the informant/appellant gave a report in the Police Station that when he was going to his home, Hariram Prajapati (the accused respondent No. 2) and Dhirendra Singh (the accused-respondent No. 3) caught hold of the informant and they assaulted the informant by but of a gun, kicks and fists and said that they would set him free only when he pays Rs. 10,000/-. 
It was further alleged that they threatened to kill him with a gun and country-made pistols. Upon finding an opportunity, the informant ran towards his home and that is when another accused (Dhanni) fired towards him with a 315 bore country made pistol with the intention to kill him. 
However, the shot missed the informant's temple and he had a narrow escape. Thereafter, the accused persons allegedly entered the informant's house and assaulted the informant's mother and sister with kicks, fists and shoes and destroyed the house-hold goods. Further, the accused threatened that if the informant makes a report of it, it will not be good for him. 
On the aforesaid allegation, a case was registered and after the investigation, a charge sheet under Sections 387, 307/37, 452, 323/34, 427 IPC was submitted in the Court against the accused-respondents. After the trial, the Court acquitted them of the charges.
Court's observations
At the outset, the Court noted that in the instant case, the prosecution primarily examined the 3 witnesses, PW-1, 2, and 4, who are informants, his mother, and his sister respectively. 
Further, the Court also found the following discrepancies in the testimonies of interested witnesses, and therefore, it held that prosecution witnesses do not appear to be trustworthy:
The testimony of the informant/PW-1 indicated that the accused had threatened him to lodge an FIR and therefore, the Court noted that the conduct of PW-1 in going alone to lodge FIR immediately after having been threatened by the accused persons was unnatural.PW-1 had alleged that the accused persons had hit him with but of the gun, stick, and kicks but the same did not leave marks or cause bleeding. The accused had not hit him hard but had hit him slowly. PW-3 who conducted a medical examination of PW-1 did not find any injury on the person of PW-1.PW-1 has stated that the medical examination of his sister was also conducted on the same day whereas the sister PW-4 had stated that she was not medically examined. No report of PW-4 is available on record and no statement in this regard has been made by PW-3.PW-1 had stated that he had gone to the Police Station alone, however, PW-2 stated that her daughter had also gone to the Police Station with her.The statement of PW-4 (informant's sister) that the accused persons hit her mother with but of country-made pistol and thrown away the goods of the shop and take away the jewelry and other articles of the marriage of PW-4 and her sister-in-law was not corroborated by the statements of PW-1 and PW-2 and appears to be false and unnatural.PW-2 had stated that the accused broke down the goods when the informant had gone to the Police Station for lodging a report, however, the breakage of goods was also mentioned in the report lodged by the Informant, which indicated, as the court noted, that the entire prosecution story was planned, concocted and fabricated, else this fact could not have been mentioned report.
In view of this, holding that the Court below had thoroughly examined the statements of all the prosecution witnesses and finding that upon scrutiny of the statements of the PW-1, PW-2, and PW-4, 8 serious discrepancies had come to light, the HC concluded that the appellant had failed to make out any ground for admission of the appeal and thus, the appeal was dismissed at the stage of admission itself.
Case title - Nokhe Lal v. State of U.P. and 2 OthersCase citation:  (AB) 116

In a significant order, the Supreme Court on Friday directed that each protected forest should have an Eco Sensitive Zone (ESZ) of 1 kilometre.
The Court further directed that no permanent structure will be allowed within the ESZ. Mining within national wildlife sanctuary or national park cannot be permitted.
If the existing ESZ goes beyond 1 km buffer zone or if any statutory instrument prescribes a higher limit, then such extended boundary shall prevail.
A bench comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao, BR Gavai and Aniruddha Bose passed the directions in applications filed in the TN Godavarman Thirumalpad case. Justice Bose read out the operative portion of the judgment.
The Chief Conservator of Forests of each state has been directed to make a list of subsisting structures at the ESZs and submit a report to the court within 3 months period.
The present set of applications arose out of a report of the Central Empwered Committee (CEC which was constituted by the Court in 2002) dated 20th November 2003. This report specifically pertains to Jamua Ramgarh wildlife sanctuary. This sanctuary covers an area of about 300 square kilometres. The Court noted that the said report gave a horrific picture of ravaging of a protected forest mainly by private miners mostly with temporary working permits obtained from the Governmental agencies.
On 20th September 2012, a second report was submitted by the CEC. The recommendations made in the second report went beyond the Jamua Ramgarh Sanctuary and dealt with creation of identification and declaration of safety zones around protected forests all across the country.
The question of having ESZ around the protected forests was examined by this Court earlier in another Writ Petition [W.P. (Civil) No. 460 of 2004] in Goa Foundation v. Union of India, in which certain directions were passed on 4th December 2006 [reported in (2011) 15 SCC 791.
A set of Guidelines for Declaration of Eco­Sensitive Zones (ESZ) around National Park and Wildlife Sanctuaries had been formulated by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) of the Government of India on 9th February 2011 [F. No.1­9/2007 WL – I (pt)]. These Guidelines deal with the process and procedures to be adopted for declaring ESZ. 
In the present order, passed in a set of applications filed by the miners, the Court held that the guidelines issued on February 9, 2011 are "reasonable".
The following are the directions issued :
(a )Each protected forest, that is national park or wildlife sanctuary must have an ESZ of minimum one kilometre measured from the demarcated boundary of such protected forest in which the activities proscribed and prescribed in the Guidelines of 9th February 2011 shall be strictly adhered to. For Jamua Ramgarh wildlife sanctuary, it shall be 500 metres so far as subsisting activities are concerned.
(b) In the event, however, the ESZ is already prescribed as per law that goes beyond one kilometre buffer zone, the wider margin as ESZ shall prevail. If such wider buffer zone beyond one kilometre is proposed under any statutory instrument for a particular national park or wildlife sanctuary awaiting final decision in that regard, then till such final decision is taken, the ESZ covering the area beyond one kilometre as proposed shall be maintained.
(c) The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests as also the Home Secretary of each State and Union Territory shall remain responsible for proper compliance of the said Guidelines as regards nature of use within the ESZ of all national parks and sanctuaries within a particular State or Union Territory. The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests for each State and Union Territory shall also arrange to make a list of subsisting structures and other relevant details within the respective ESZs forthwith and a report shall be furnished before this Court by the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests of each State and Union Territory within a period of three months. For this purpose, such authority shall be entitled to take assistance of any governmental agency for satellite imaging or photography using drones.
(d) Mining within the national parks and wildlife sanctuaries shall not be permitted.
(e) In the event any activity is already being undertaken within the one kilometre or extended buffer zone (ESZ), as the case may be, of any wildlife sanctuary or national park which does not come within the ambit of prohibited activities as per the 9th February 2011 Guidelines, such activities may continue with permission of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests of each State or Union Territory and the person responsible for such activities in such a situation shall obtain necessary permission within a period of six months. Such permission shall be given once the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests is satisfied that the activities concerned do not come within the prohibited list and were continuing prior to passing of this order in a legitimate manner. No new permanent structure shall be permitted to come up for whatsoever purpose within the ESZ.
(f) The minimum width of the ESZ may be diluted in overwhelming public interest but for that purpose the State or Union Territory concerned shall approach the CEC and MoEF&CC and both these bodies shall give their respective opinions/recommendations before this Court. On that basis, this Court shall pass appropriate order.
(g) In the event the CEC, MoEF&CC, the Standing Committee of National Board of Wildlife or any other body of persons or individual having special interest in environmental issues consider it necessary for maintaining a wider or larger ESZ in respect of any national park or wildlife sanctuary, such body or individual shall approach the CEC. In such a situation the CEC shall be at liberty to examine the need of a wider ESZ in respect of any national park or wildlife sanctuary in consultation with all the stakeholders including the State or Union Territory concerned, MoEF&CC as also the Standing Committee of National Board of Wildlife and then approach this Court with its recommendations.
(h) In respect of sanctuaries or national parks for which the proposal of a State or Union Territory has not been given, the 10 kilometres buffer zone as ESZ, as indicated in the order passed by this Court on 4th December 2006 in the case of Goa Foundation (supra) and also contained in the Guidelines of 9th February 2011 shall be implemented. Within that area, the entire set of restrictions concerning an ESZ shall operate till a final decision in that regard is arrived at.

The Allahabad High Court has directed the Uttar Pradesh Government to consider giving employment of one of the family members of the Hathras Gang rape Victim under the Government or Government Undertaking commensurate with the qualification possessed by them.
The bench of Justice Rajan Roy and Justice Jaspreet Singh further directed the government to consider their relocation to any other place within the State outside Hathras keeping in mind their social and economic rehabilitation and also the educational needs of the children.
The Court noted that after the Hathras Rape incident happened, it hogged in newspapers and social media, etc., and therefore, the Court added, one can very well imagine that it would not be easy for the family to live in a village Boolgadhi (district Hathras).
"It is not too much for the family to ask for relocation outside Hathras in the circumstances in which they find themselves wherein their movements are highly restricted on account of their security by the CRPF and also on account of the alleged hostile behaviour/attitude of the other villagers who belong to the upper caste," the Court added.
The Court also took into account the fact that none of the male members of the victim's family is employed as of now as a consequence of the atrocity committed against them.
The case in brief
These directions have been issued by the bench which was hearing a Suo-Moto case instituted over the Hathras Rape and Cremation case to examine the right to decent and dignified last rites/cremation.
The Court had taken cognizance of the rape of a 19-year-old girl belonging to the SC community followed by her cremation in the wee hours of the night intervening 29/30 September 2020 which appeared to be against the wishes of her family members.
The Court had noted that these incidents had raised important questions pertaining to the fundamental right to a decent burial and the role of State authorities in this regard.
In these very proceedings, the victim's family had claimed employment for one of its members i.e. the elder brother in view of Item 46 of Schedule Annexure-I referable to Rule 12(4) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995 and Section 15A of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, and the assurance given to it on 30 September 2020 by the Head of the State which has been recorded in a document of the same date.
The family had also claimed relocation as per the provisions of the Act 1989 considering the inimical condition in its village.
State's submissions 
The Government of UP submitted before the Court that the benefits prescribed under Item 46 of the Schedule Annexure-I to the Rules 1995 are not mandatory. It was also submitted that the employment referred in Item 46 of Schedule Annexure-I to the Rules 1995 was only with respect to 'dependents' of the victim or widow which the family members were not.
It was also submitted that the assurances (of providing employment) recorded in the minutes dated 30.09.2020 are contrary to the provisions of Rules 1995 and are not enforceable in a Court of law.
The Counsels for the State suggested that the Government could arrange private employment to one of the members of the family, however, when the Court asked as to how the State will arrange private employment, it was submitted that after the conclusion of the trial the State is agreeable to consider the grant of employment to one member of the family.
Lastly, the UP Government also opposed the redressal of the grievance of the family members of the hathras rape victim as it was submitted that these proceedings, being in the public interest, cannot be used by the victim's family for redressal of their individual grievance.
It was contended that the jurisdiction, if at all in this regard, is with the Special Court under Section 15A (6) of the Act 1989, therefore, this Court should not consider this issue.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court noted that the Court has initiated suo moto proceedings on account of the fact that the victim and her family belong to the downtrodden class of the society i.e. they were from the socially and economically weaker section of the society, poorest of the poor, who have been given certain protections by the Constitution and also statutorily by the Act 1989.
"...such persons are often not in a position to raise their grievance or assert their rights for various reasons including their unawareness and their social, educational and economic status," the Court observed.
Further, analyzing Act 1989 and the Rules made thereunder, the Court came to a firm conclusion that the victim's family has a legal basis for its claim of relocation and job. Further, rejecting the argument of the state that the provision of employment in such a case would violate Articles 14 and 16 is without any constitutional and legal basis, the Court held thus:
"We have already held that the family members of the deceased are 'victims', therefore, one of the family members is entitled to employment and it is on account of this that the Head of the State assured employment to one of the family members on a Group 'C' post as is recorded in the document dated 30.09.2020 which we have quoted hereinabove. This document is signed by the District Magistrate and various other public authorities. The father of the deceased has also signed it. We have already held that the said assurance and the document dated 30.09.2020 is not contrary to the provision of the Act 1989 and Rules 1995, especially Item 46 of Schedule Annexure-I to the Rules 1995, because such an act has statutory backing and there is a rationale behind it i.e to provide relief and rehabilitation to the family of the victim which belongs to SC/ST which is in furtherance of the object of the Act 1989...The only other source of income available is one and half bigha land in their possession, therefore, clearly a family which comprises of nine members with three children who in the days to come will go to school, does not have adequate means of sustenance. Clearly the family is in need of employment and that is why the same was promised by the Head of the State. The promise is not based on any whims or fancy, but it is referable to statutory provisions and the Rules made thereunder..."
The Court also noted that the offer of a private job to the victim's family was something that was not expected from the State Government and absolutely uncalled for. Now, so far as the claim for relocation of the family members was concerned, the Court said that the provision for it existed in Section 15-A (6)(d) and Rule 15 (aa),(b), and (c) of 1989 Act.
The Court also took into account the fact that the majority of the population in the village belongs to the upper castes and it is stated that the family is always targeted by other villagers and even after being under the security of CRPF whenever the family members go out, they are subjected to abuse and objectionable comments in the village.
In view of this, considering the social and economic condition of the victim's family as also the mental state in which the family members claim to be, which, the Court noted, was not improbable in view of the social strata to which they belong and the demography of the village, therefore, the Court was of the opinion that the State should consider their relocation to any other place within the State outside Hathras keeping in mind their social and economic rehabilitation and also the educational needs of the children.
The Court further gave 6 months to the state government to take a decision in this respect as the Court noted that the area of relocation has to be socially conducive to the family members apart from being conducive to their economic and educational rehabilitation, which would take some time.
The Court also asked the District Magistrate, Hathras to look into the request by the family members on a representation regarding reimbursement of traveling and maintenance expenses to witnesses, including the victims of atrocities, during the investigation and trial of offences under the SC/ST Act.

Dismissing the criminal revision plea of a convict who hit a bike in a rash and negligent manner thereby causing the death of two persons, the Madhya Pradesh High Court last week noted that the court should not award a flea-bite sentence for offence under Section 304-A of IPC by showing undue sympathy.
Section 304-A Indian Penal Code deals with Causing death by negligence [Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both]
This assertion came from the bench of Justice G. S. Ahluwalia that observed that the convict wasn't even eligible for a reduction of the jail sentence as two persons lost their lives due to the applicant/convict, who was solely negligent in causing the accident by hitting the motorcycle by coming from the wrong direction.
The background of the case
The Court was dealing with a Criminal Revision filed against the judgment and sentence dated September 15, 2021, passed by First Additional Sessions Judge, Ganjbasoda, Link Court Kurvai, District Vidisha, affirming the judgment and sentence, by which the applicant had been convicted for 279, 338 and 304-A of IPC.
It was submitted by the counsel for the applicant that four persons, i.e. two males and one woman were riding on a motorcycle along with a minor girl and thus, it was clear that they themselves were negligent as only two persons can ride on a motorcycle. 
It was further submitted that in fact, no accident had taken place from the motorcycle of the applicant and since the driver of the motorcycle could not control the motorcycle, therefore, it slipped, and as a result, two persons riding on the said motorcycle died on the spot.
Court's observations 
Perusing the post mortem report, the Bench observed that the deceased (Priti and Chandrashekhar) had sustained multiple external and internal injuries including multiple fractures, as a result, they died on the spot, and that the death of both persons was accidental in nature.
Further, taking into account the spot map prepared by the police, the Court concluded that the accident took place on the extreme side of the road, and thus, the Court held thus:
"...the evidence of the witnesses that the deceased was driving the vehicle on the extreme left side, whereas the applicant hit the motorcycle by coming from the wrong side appears to be correct."
The Court further noted that according to the applicant himself, the deceased persons were on their left side and since the accident took place on the extreme left side of the road, therefore, the Court concluded as follows :
"...it is clear that the applicant was driving the motorcycle in a wrong direction and hit the motorcycle of the deceased Chandrashekhar, while they were on the extreme left side of the road. Thus, it is the applicant who was at fault. Merely because three male persons and one minor girl were riding on the motorcycle, would not give any authority to the applicant to hit the said motorcycle by coming from the wrong direction."
Concludingly, the Court opined that it was the applicant himself, who was driving the offending vehicle and by coming from the wrong side, hit the motorcycle of the deceased, resulting in the death of two persons. 
As the findings of facts recorded by the Courts below cannot be said to be perverse or contrary to the record, accordingly, the Court upheld the conviction of the applicant for the offences under Sections 279, 338, and 304-A of IPC.

Relying on instances of high degree of "mental cruelty" meted out by a wife to her 36-year-old husband, the Bombay High Court's Nagpur Bench granted him a divorce.
 Justice GA Sanap held that the evidence on record proves that the respondent-wife inflicted upon the appellant-husband mental pain and sufferings which would make it impossible for him to live with her. It has been proved that the mental cruelty is such that it would in all probability cause injury to the health of the appellant, he added.
It was further held that the family court had failed to consider the wife's marriage profiles on two matrimonial websites while rejecting the man's divorce petition last year.
 "On the basis of this document, it can be inferred that she wanted to get rid of the appellant and wanted to perform the second marriage," the court said in its ex-parte order.  
 Moreover, the court noted that the woman's conduct wasn't consistent with her written statement in which she claimed to be an "obedient wife" despite which her in-laws wanted to get rid of her. 
 Case before Court:
 It was the husband's case that after their marriage in July, 2014 in Akola, he began living with his wife in Panjim as he was employed with at Goa. However, the woman insisted on living in Akola, and finally left his house within a year. 
 The wife had in turn filed several complaints in the police station, women's commission, and an application under Section 125 of the CrPC before the family court, alleging a case under the Domestic Violence Act and another complaint under Section 498 of the CrPC, against him and his family members.
 In 2020, while the family court had accepted that the wife had treated the man with cruelty, the court said it was not enough to cause reasonable apprehension that it would be harmful or injurious for him to live with the wife.
 The husband thus approached High Court.
The appellant went on to point out that his wife had a matrimonial profile.
 While passing an ex-parte order, the High Court observed that the man was left to fight divorce proceedings six years after the woman walked out of their marital home in 2015.
"The evidence clearly indicate that the respondent had no wish and desire to remain in company of the appellant. If the respondent had sincere wish and desire to save her marriage she would not have taken a conscious decision to perform the second marriage even before the final out come of the divorce petition. The evidence placed on record by the appellant coupled with the conduct of the respondent through-out and subsequent to the filling of the petition would prove beyond doubt that the respondent had made the life of the appellant miserable," said the Court.
The Court further noted that the wife had made "wild" and "unfounded" complaints against the respondent and the concerned Magistrate had rightly rejected the wife's domestic violence complaint on merits.
 "It is further pertinent to note that the conduct of the respondent to perform the second marriage and not to lead the life with the appellant is writ large from the fact that she did not apply for restitution of conjugal rights…In our opinion, the appellant on the basis of cogent and concrete evidence has made out the case that he was made to suffer mental cruelty of high degree and therefore, he took a conscious decision to get separated from the respondent."

Merely intimidating a kidnapped child to stop him from shouting for help did not prove the ingredient of threat resulting in a reasonable apprehension that such person may be hurt or killed as required for sustaining a conviction under Section 364A (kidnapping for ransom, etc.) of the Indian Penal Code, said the Supreme Court last week.
 A division bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and B.V. Nagarathna, while substituting the convictions under Section 364A of four men accused of kidnapping a school-going-boy for ransom, for a lesser offence of kidnapping simpliciter given under Section 363 (punishment for kidnapping) of the criminal code, held:
 “The second ingredient of the charge under Section 364A, namely, threat resulting in giving rise to a reasonable apprehension that such person may be put to death or hurt have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The courts below did not thoroughly address this doubt before convicting the appellants. For proving the ingredient of threat, the intimidation of the child victim, for the purpose of making him silent, cannot be enough. If the sentence carrying a maximum sentence of death and a minimum sentence of life sentence has such a low evidentiary threshold, the difference between punishments for kidnapping under 363, 364 and 364A shall become meaningless.”
 This set of appeals had arisen out of a kidnapping case, in which five accused (of whom one died during the pendency of appeal) were convicted under Sections 148 and 364A read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Before travelling in appeal to the top court, the appellate jurisdiction of the Punjab and Haryana High Court had been invoked. Upholding the impugned order, the High Court had held that all ingredients of Section 364A had been satisfied. The high court also rejected the appellant’s contention that there were material discrepancies in the prosecution’s case, affirming the veracity of the statement of the kidnapping victim, who was a fourteen-year-old boy at the time of the incident.
 However, by comparing the victim’s statement to the police immediately after the incident, with that recorded by the trial court two years later, the apex court noted that the statement had been modified to reflect three differences, namely, a change in the exact timing of the threat, the specificity of the delivery of the threat to kill, and an omission of the intent behind the threat. These amended details were crucial for proving the second ingredient of a charge under Section 364A and bringing home the guilt under this provision. Therefore, the second ingredient, the court held, had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. On this ground, the Supreme Court took a different stand than the courts below it and set aside the conviction of the accused under Section 364A. In doing so, it placed heavy reliance on its decision in Sk. Ahmed v. State of Telangana, (2021) 9 SCC 59, in which the three stages or components of the said section were outlined as follows:
 Kidnapping or abduction of a person and keeping them in detention,Threat to cause death or hurt, and the use of kidnapping, abduction, or detention with a demand to pay the ransom,When the demand is not met, then causing death.
 According to the bench, the second ingredient was missing from the present case, which is why they held a conviction under Section 364A to be unsustainable. Thus, noting that it possessed a wide power to alter charges under Section 216 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 whilst not causing prejudice to the accused, the court allowed the appeals in part and substituted the convictions under Section 364A with that for an offence under Section 363. Justice Nagarathna wrote: 
 “The appellants are now convicted for the offence under Section 363, i.e., kidnapping and sentenced to imprisonment for seven years and a fine of Rs. 2000/-. If the appellants have completed imprisonment of more than seven years with remission and have paid the fine of Rs. 2000/-, we direct the appellants to be released forthwith; if not on bail. If not, the appellants shall surrender within a period of four weeks and serve the remainder of the sentence.”

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently stressed that when an under trial has been in custody for a significant period of time and the trial is being held up for no fault on his part, the Courts cannot be expected to be a mute spectator and should rather unhesitatingly interfere for securing the personal liberty of an under trial.
With this, the bench of Justice Manjari Nehru Kaul granted bail to an NDPS Accused who was in custody since October 2020 as the Court noted that the trial has come to a virtual standstill due to the non-appearance of the official witnesses.
"The petitioner cannot be left to languish for an indefinite period during the pendency of a trial for reasons not attributable to him. It needs to be reiterated that the right to life and personal liberty granted by the Constitution of India also covers the right to a speedy trial."
The petitioner (Gurbir Singh) moved the instant 3rd regular bail plea in connection with a criminal case registered against him under Section 21 of the NDPS Act. It was his counsel's submission that after the dismissal of his earlier two bail pleas, the trial had come to a virtual standstill as none of the prosecution witnesses (all official witnesses), failed to put an appearance before the Court below to get their evidence recorded.
The state's counsel couldn't controvert the submissions made by the petitioner's counsel that despite the issuance of bailable as well as non-bailable warrants to secure the presence of the other prosecution witnesses, including the Investigating Officer and Gazetted Officer, they had failed to put in an appearance and get their evidence recorded before the trial Court,
In view of this, reiterating that the right to life and personal liberty granted by the Constitution of India also covers the right to a speedy trial, the Court granted bail to the accused.
Case title - GURBIR SINGH v. STATE OF PUNJAB

Stating that many individuals on Youtube are propagating "wrong and deceitful" information, the Madras High Court has said that the use of digital media "to vent ire" against constitutional functionaries and senior officers of the state and centre government "would not only be a personal attack on their privacy and prestige" but would also damage their reputation and have cascading effect on their work.
"The opinion among the public about the said officials would be blown to smithereens, which would not be in the interest of the Nation," Justice M. Dhandapani said.
The court at the outset noted that a decade and a half ago, it was only the print media which would disseminate news. The media was very conscious of their reporting, which resulted in the citizens being fed with good information, the court said.
"But the emergence of the digital media, more especially the social media platforms, and coupled with the rights that have been vested on the citizens by the Constitution, not having been understood properly, the citizens, through the various social media platforms cause havoc to the nation and degrade the credibility and respect which the other countries around the globe have on Mother India," it added.
Social Media Surveillance
The court on January 29 in 2020 had directed the state Director General of Police to constitute separate, dedicated and special cell in each Station House, both at District Level as well as State Level for tracking the "unscrupulous offenders", who "post filthy and derogatory messages/videos in the social media not only against the constitutional functionaries and high officials in the State and Central Government, but also against the common man"
The Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu, which had been asked to invite bids for purchase of equipment for surveillance of social media, on October 18 told the court that tenders have been received and they will be opened within a week, adding that a report regarding it will be filed before the court by next date of hearing.
"The said statement is recorded and the respondents are directed to take steps for procuring the equipments upon opening of the tender and establish the Special Cells at the earliest, as the matter has been on board of this Court for more than a year and half without much progress having been made in the constitution and functioning of the Special Cells, which were directed to be constituted," said the court.
The bench further said it had directed the constitution of Special Cells so that as and when complaints are received, the same could be dealt with and "the scurrilous acts" could be nipped in the bud.
"This Court is not pointing out any particular instance or channel that castigates the individuals and the officials in the State and Central Government and the constitutional functionaries," it said.
The court added that it could "wield its judicial power to curb the menace" and maintain the "social decorum and harmony" in the society but it is the duty of the law enforcing agencies to be more vigilant and come to the rescue of the affected persons, rather than putting it on the head of the Court to interfere in each and every single instance.
"Only with that view in mind this Court had constituted the Special Cells and, therefore, the operation of the Special Cells at the earliest is of utmost importance," said the court.
Seeking a comprehensive report from the DGP and for considering the report of the Electronics Corporation, the court listed the matter for hearing on November 02.
The court has been passing the orders regarding constitution of special cells in a bail matter of a person, who was accused of posting "defamatory, abusive and unsubstantiated statements not only against an advocate "but also against a serving Judge of this Court and the entire Judicial system".

"Custodial violence, custodial torture and custodial deaths have always been a concern for civilized society. Times and again the judicial verdicts of the Apex Court and other Courts have shown their concern and anguish in such matters," observed Allahabad High Court as it denied bail to a cop in connection with the custodial death of a 24-year-old man.
The bench of Justice Samit Gopal categorically observed that it was not only a case of police excess but a clear-cut case of abuse of police powers and police high-handedness. 
The Court was essentially dealing with the bail application of a UP police official who is accused of taking away the deceased from his house to the Police Station and therefater killing him in connivance with other police officials.
The allegations against the police officials are also that they forcibly entered his house and after breaking the lock of the box took away Rs.60,000/- and other articles and used filthy language against the family members of the deceased.
When the informant (brother of the deceased) went to the police station, he was not allowed to meet with his brother (deceased), and in the morning, the information was received that his brother died in police custody as he was murdered by the policemen. 
Thereafter, a case was registered against the accused police officers under Sections 302, 394, 452 & 504 I.P.C. Initially, the case was being probed by the local police, thereafter, the matter was transferred to the CBI, as per the High Court's order.

The High Court noted that an arrest memo was prepared regarding the arrest of the deceased by the officials of the police and in the arrest memo, the applicant was one of the persons arresting him and was also a signatory to it.
The Court further took into account the fact that the injuries as received by the deceased covered basically the entire back side of his body and the opinion of the Board of AIIMS, New Delhi was specific to the fact that he died due to the collective effect of the injuries received by him. 
"The same would go to show that the death was not natural. The present case is a case of custodial torture and death with robbery in a well planned conspiracy. The applicant is in the police force which is considered to be disciplined force and enshrined with the pious duty of maintaining law and order and protecting the citizens. The present case is not a case of police excess but a clear cut case of abuse of police powers and police high-handedness," the Court further noted as it did not find it a fit case for bail.

The Allahabad High Court has clarified that the charge under Section 326A IPC can be framed against the accused even if no grievous hurt has been caused to the acid attack survivor and that grievous hurt to an acid attack survivor is not mandatory in each case.It may be noted that this provision deals with the offence and punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid, etc....
The Allahabad High Court has clarified that the charge under Section 326A IPC can be framed against the accused even if no grievous hurt has been caused to the acid attack survivor and that grievous hurt to an acid attack survivor is not mandatory in each case.
It may be noted that this provision deals with the offence and punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid, etc. It says that whoever causes permanent or partial damage or deformity to, or burns or maims or disfigures or disables, any part or parts of the body of a person or causes grievous hurt by throwing acid on or by administering acid to that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years but which may extend to life imprisonment.
It may be noted that Section 320 of IPC defines 'Grievous hurt'.
The case in brief
Essentially, the Bench of Justice Om Prakash Tripathi was dealing with a revision plea filed by an accused booked under Sections 326-A, 504, 506 IPC against the order of the lower court rejecting his discharge application under Section 227 Cr.P.C.
It was his case that prima facie, charges under Section 326A IPC was not made out against him as there was no grievous injury on the body of the acid attack survivor. It was further argued that there was no permanent or partial damage or deformity to or burns or maims or disfigures or disables, any part or parts of the body, so charge under Section 326A or 326B was not made out. 
On the other hand, the state's counsel submitted that there is prima facie material to frame the charge under Section 326A IPC against the revisionist and that a co-accused had already been convicted under Sections 326A and 506 IPC.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court observed that in total 9 "OR" has been used in this section which shows that the charge under Section 326A IPC can be framed without grievous hurt to the victim/survivor. 
"But grievous hurt to acid burn victim, is not mandatory in each case. Nine "OR" has been used to show that in case of permanent or partial damage, deformity, burns, maims, disfigures, disables any part of the body of the person, or by administering acid to that person, charge under Section 326A IPC should be framed in such situation. Thus, the submission of the learned counsel for the revisionist has no force," the Court observed as it discarded the argument of the counsel for the accused.
The Court also took into account the injuries received by the 18-year-old survivor to stress that she had sustained burn acid injury.
Further, noting that the trial is at the stage of framing the charges, the Court stressed that at the time of framing of charge, the court is not required to screen evidence or to apply the standard of whether the prosecution will be able to prove the case against the accused at the trial. 
"Charge can be framed even on the basis of strong suspicion founded on material before the Court. On the basis of above discussion, this Court is of the view that trial court has passed a legal order, there is not manifest error or material irregularity in the impugned order. There is prima facie evidence material against the revisionist to frame charge against the revisionist under Section 326A IPC also and in such circumstances applicant is not liable to be discharged," the Court added.
Consequently, finding no force in the criminal revision, the plea was dismissed.

The Supreme Court, in a judgment passed last week, examined the applicability of res judicata between co-defendants.The court observed that the requisite conditions to apply the principle of res judicata as between co-defendants are that :(a) there must be conflict of interest between the defendants concerned; (b) it must be necessary to decide this conflict in order to give the plaintiff the relief he claims; and (c) the question between the defendants must have been finally decided.It also observed that the principle of Res Judicata will not apply if the subject matter of the suit is not same as that of earlier suit. For res judicata to apply, the matter in the former suit must have been alleged by one party and either denied or admitted, expressly or impliedly by the other, the bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta reiterated.Background facts
Legal heirs of Late S.V. Srinivasulu Naidu filed an application before the Special Court, Hyderabad (Tribunal) under Section 8 of the Andhra Pradesh Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act,1982, alleging that their land grabbed by the Union of India. The applicants alleged that their father had purchased the said land from one Shaik Ahmed. That, their father sold it to some persons, who later filed a suit against their father, Union of India, State of Andhra Pradesh. In the said suit, the Plaintiff claimed that his vendor Shaik Ahmed and then the father of the applicants was the owner in possession of the property since purchase of the property on 20.3.1964, but the contractors of the Union of India, trespassed into the schedule property. That their father filed written statement in which he asserted that he had no objection to the Plaintiff suit being decreed. This suit was thus decreed on 13.8.1970 declaring the plaintiffs as title holders of the suit property. An appeal filed by the Union of India before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh was dismissed on 31.3.1975. Later, before the Tribunal, the applicants contended that they are original owners of the land in question and the Government had no right or title over the property. The Tribunal allowed the application and the High Court affirmed the order of tribunal.

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday observed that unreasonable denial of an employee's request seeking inter cadre transfer by the State impinges upon such person's right to demand respect for her or his family life.
"We have no doubt that the right to meaningful family life, which allows a person to live a fulfilling life and helps in retaining her/his physical, psychological and emotional integrity would find a place in the four corners of Article 21 of the Constitution of India2. Therefore, when the State unreasonably denies a request of an employee [in this case, the petitioner] seeking inter-cadre transfer, it impinges upon such person's right to demand respect for her/his family life," a bench comprising Justice Rajiv Shakdher and Justice Talwant Singh observed.
The Court was dealing with a plea filed by Lakshmi Bhavya Tanneeru, an IAS Officer, challenging an order dated 02.02.2021 passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal wherein her request for inter-cadre transfer on the ground of marriage to another officer belonging to All India Services was declined. 
The petitioner was allocated the State of West Bengal cadre on 01.09.2015 pursuant to which she had entered into matrimony on 25.03.2016, with, one, Raja Gopal Sunkara, who was also an IAS officer, belonging to the Tamil Nadu cadre.
The case of the petitioner was that the Tribunal, after setting aside the order, had remanded the matter, whereas the relief sought by her was the issuance of a direction to the State of West Bengal to communicate its no objection to the Government of India, Department of Personnel and Training concerning her request for inter-cadre transfer. 
While the proceedings were ongoing, the State of West Bengal had passed a fresh order dated 02.08.2021 wherein it had once again rejected the request of the petitioner for grant of no objection.
It was thus submitted on behalf of the petitioner that discriminatory treatment had been meted out against her and that while her request for inter-cadre transfer was rejected on 25.11.2016 on the ground of shortage of officers, the request of several other officers, on similar ground, was considered.
Further stating that the failure on the part of the State of West Bengal to issue a no-objection for effecting her inter-cadre transfer had gravely impacted her well-being and familial relationships. 
It was also argued that the said action of the State of West Bengal had resulted in a violation of the her fundamental rights, under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.
On the other hand, the State of West Bengal submitted that the inter-cadre transfer could only be effected with the concurrence of the State, which was in accordance with Rule 5(2) of the 1954 Cadre Rules.
It was also argued that owing to the Covid-19 pandemic in the State, the administration was in dire need of the services of it's officers, who were tasked to deal with the pandemic.
"State of West Bengal's attempt to defend its decision, to reject the petitioner's request for inter-cadre transfer by citing the occurrence of the pandemic does not impress us, as it seems tenuous for the very same reason. The petitioner has placed on record the details of officers who have been transferred by other State Governments on the ground of marriage, during the pandemic; presumably having regard to the familial interest of the officers. As a matter of fact, the State of West Bengal has received via inter- cadre transfers, three IAS officers from the States of Manipur, Kerala and Rajasthan," the Court observed at the outset. 
The Court also added that the refusal of the request made for inter-cadre transfer by an officer on the ground of marriage can only be sustained if it is backed by cogent reasons, as such a decision is subject to judicial review.
The Court therefore set aside the two orders and directed the State of West Bengal to issue a no-objection directive to the petitioner in order to enable effectuation of her request for inter-cadre transfer within two weeks. 
"Respondent no.1 will act on the said no objection, and accordingly, effect inter-cadre transfer of the petitioner from the State of West Bengal to the State of Tamil Nadu," it added. 
Title: LAKSHMI BHAVYA TANNEERU v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS.

The Gujarat High Court has held that merely because an employee appointed to Class-IV post is handed over additional duties with respect to a higher post for a temporary period, may be during the leave vacancy of actual employee, cannot demand entire salary differential.
The Court took into account the differential aspect of appointment in Class-IV and Class-III category and concluded that merely because the petitioner, a Class-IV workman was doing additional work of Class-III category, it did not imply that he will be entitled to the pay-scale of Class-III post. 
In the instant case, the workman was appointed to the post of a Ward-boy and would take additional responsibilities of a Telephone Operator which was a Class-III post. In such a case, the workman was not entitled to salary differential between the two posts. Justice Kogje explained the fallacy in the Industrial Tribunal's order in the following manner:
"The requirement of the Recruitment Rules specifies that a Ward-boy only to be literate and there is no specification with regard to selection process whereas… post of Telephone Operator being Class-III, the post had prescribed qualification of SSC pass and experience of Telephone Exchange and such person would be eligible for selection process. This being the most important aspect, the Industrial Tribunal ought not to have granted the pay scale of Class-III post to the respondent, who was admittedly appointed on the post of a Ward-boy."
The Petitioner-Corporation herein challenged the IT's order directing him to grant INR 5.4 lacs as differential amount in salary by treating the Respondent-workman as a Telephone Operator in place of a Ward-boy. It was asserted that only in the times of necessity, was the workman required to undertake duties of a Telephone Operator. The workman as a Ward-by had not undergone any selection procedure, as well. Therefore, he could claim only 'charge allowance' at best for the additional work. Per contra, the workman insisted that the Tribunal had take into consideration the duties discharged to conclude that the workman was entitled to the salary differential. Further, the Petitioner had also issued internal advertisement for appointment to the post of a Telephone Operator amongst the existing employees which included the workman.
Perusing these contentions, the Bench observed that the workman, due to past knowledge of telephone operation, undertook the duties by a 'stop-gap arrangement.' The duties were never constant or continuous. It was 'misleading' to state that the workman had performed the duty on a permanent vacant post since 1998. No such entry was made in the service book of the workman, as well. A Ward-boy could not be legally appointed to the Telephone Operator (Class-III), per the Bench. There was also no explanation as to why the Petitioner had waited for almost 11 years to raise the industrial dispute in 2009. Per Justice Kogje, the Tribunal had failed to consider that the Ward-boy's work was more physical than the Telephone Operator's. Thus, the workman got advantage out of his own choice to work as an Operator.
Keeping in view these factors, the Bench set aside the Tribunal's order granting salary differential. However, considering that the workman had worked as an operator at times, he was entitled to INR 2 lacs as difference in salary and not the entire wage differential.

Case Title: SHARDA CHIMANBHAI LALBHAI v/s DINESH MOHANBHAI PRAJAPATI

The Karnataka High Court has said that maintenance under Section 125 CrPC is a matter of right to a neglected wife, even in cases where she withdraws the petition seeking divorce.
 A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna said, "The divorce petition being withdrawn by the wife is of no avail as the wife is still in the matrimonial fold with the husband. So long as the respondent remains a legally wedded wife of the petitioner and the fact that she has been deserted by the husband, interim maintenance is a matter of right to the wife."
 It added, "The order of the trial Court on an application  filed by the wife under Section 125(1) CrPC cannot be taken exception merely because the petitioner is ready and willing to take her back."
 Case Details: 
 The Petitioner-husband approached the court questioning the order of Family court directing him to pay Rs 7,000 interim maintenance to his estranged wife.
 It is the case of the petitioner that he got married to the Respondent in March 2020 when they were aged 64 years and 58 years old, respectively. However, by May 2020, the respondent deserted him, left the matrimonial home and instituted two proceedings – one seeking divorce from him and the other under Section 125 of CrPC seeking maintenance.
 The petition seeking divorce was withdrawn by her. However, on the application filed under Section 125(1) of CrPC, an order was passed directing payment of interim maintenance of Rs.7,000/- per month.
 Petitioner's arguments:
 The counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that interim maintenance is to be paid to a wife who has been neglected and deserted by the husband, but even as on date the petitioner is ready and willing to welcome the respondent back and lead a happy married life as both of them got married only for companionship.
 On the other hand the respondent opposed the plea by contending that though she stayed with the petitioner for a month, it became impossible for her to live with him as he was constantly harassing her.
 Findings:
 The bench on going through the averments made in the petition and considering the reply by the respondent said, "So long as the respondent remains the wife, it is the duty of the petitioner to maintain his wife. Any other interpretation that the learned counsel for the petitioner would seek to render to the provision, Section 125 of the CrPC, or the order passed by the concerned Court answering the application under Section 125(1) of the CrPC, would defeat the object of the provision itself."
 Referring to the order passed by the trial court the bench said, "The reasons rendered are cogent and coherent which would not call for any interference at the hands of this Court."
 Accordingly it dismissed the petition.

While dropping the proceedings under Section 145 CrPC because of the pendency of civil litigations, a Magistrate cannot make any observations or return any findings as regards rights of the parties qua the property in question, the Supreme Court observed.
Section 145 deals with the power of an Executive Magistrate in cases where dispute concerning land or water is likely to cause breach of peace. It provides that 'whenever an Executive Magistrate is satisfied from a report of a police officer or upon other information that a dispute likely to cause a breach of the peace exists concerning any land or water or the boundaries thereof, within his local jurisdiction, he shall make an order in writing, stating the grounds of his being so satisfied, and requiring the parties concerned in such dispute to attend his Court in person or by pleader, on a specified date and time, and to put in written statements of their respective claims as respects the fact of actual possession of the subject of dispute.'
In the present case, the Magistrate after noticing that different cases are sub-judice in civil courts for the same property between these parties dropped the proceedings initiated under Section 145 CrPC. However while doing so, the Magistrate directed to maintain status quo on the spot by the time competent civil court passes any final decision. In this Special Leave Petition, the issue raised was regarding the jurisdiction of the Magistrate to issue such directions.
"While dropping the proceedings under Section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 ('CrPC') because of the pendency of civil litigations, the learned Magistrate could not be considered justified in making any observations or returning any findings as regards rights of the parties qua the property in question. The learned Magistrate had proceeded to record the findings, as if the possession of the respondent on the questioned property was proved from the documentary evidence from the date of issuing notice and two months prior to the same and then, had also proceeded to order that the second party would not interfere in the peaceful possession of the first party until the competent Civil Court passes final judgment in the matter, and that status quo shall be maintained.", the bench comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sudhanshu Dhulia observed.
While disposing the SLP, the bench observed that the Magistrate ought to have left all the relevant aspects for consideration of the competent civil court and without recording any finding in the matter.

While dismissing the anticipatory bail application filed in a fake lawyer case, the Kerala High Court remarked that a lawyer owes paramount responsibility to his client first, and to the court second.
Justice Shircy V in her order also observed that the legal profession was one of the noblest:
"The lawyers' profession is considered to be one of the noblest professions. Lawyers have to play a pivotal role in the administration of justice as only with their sincere and purposeful effort and assistance the Courts could administer justice properly."
The Bench laid down a few duties shouldered by the legal fraternity in its judgment, particularly towards the Courts:
"They owe onerous responsibility and duty towards the Courts and they are considered as the officers of the Courts."
However, it was substantiated that their foremost duty lay towards their clients. 
"Their first responsibility is towards their clients and then to the courts. So, misrepresenting or presenting as an Advocate before a client and obtaining his/her brief as if she is an Advocate, itself would amount to cheating towards the public."
While denying pre-arrest bail to Xavier, the Single Judge ruled that the Bar Associations must cross-check and verify with the Bar Council before admitting a new member to prevent similar incidents in the future. 
The observation came in a matter where the petitioner had practised in the State as an Advocate for over two years without enrollment and had approached the Court with an anticipatory bail application upon the incident coming to light. 
The Bench while dismissing the application observed that she had not merely deceived the Bar Association or the general public, but the entire Judicial system.

The Supreme Court on Monday ordered the constitution of a 3-member independent expert committee to probe into the allegations of widespread and targeted surveillance of activists, journalists, politicians and constitutional authorities using the Pegasus spyware. The committee will be headed by former Supreme Court judge Justice RV Raveendran.
A Bench comprising the Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, Justice Surya Kant and Justice Hima Kohli on Monday expressed strong reservations against the practice of indiscriminate surveillance of individuals in a democracy that lead to a  'chilling effect' on the freedom of speech. 
"In a democratic country governed by the rule of law, indiscriminate spying on individuals cannot be allowed except with sufficient statutory safeguards, by following the procedure established by law under the Constitution", the Bench observed. 
The Court also observed that surveillance will have a chilling effect on the freedom of press. The Court noted that the protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for the freedom of press.
The judgment observed :
"An important and necessary corollary of such a right is to ensure the protection of sources of information. Protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for the freedom of the press. Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest.
Having regard to the importance of the protection of journalistic sources for press freedom in a democratic society and the potential chilling effect that snooping techniques may have, this Court's task in the present matter, where certain grave allegations of infringement of the rights of the citizens of the country have been raised, assumes great significance. In this light, this Court is compelled to take up the cause to determine the truth and get to the bottom of the allegations made herein".
Any restriction on right to privacy must necessarily pass constitutional scrutiny 
The Court acknowledged that while technology is a useful tool for improving the lives of the people, it can also lead to unreasonable State intrusions and breach the right to privacy of an individual. It was also categorically underscored that any any restrictions imposed on the right to privacy must necessarily pass constitutional scrutiny. 
"Members of a civilized democratic society have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Privacy is not the singular concern of journalists or social activists. Every citizen of India ought to be protected against violations of privacy. It is this expectation which enables us to exercise our choices, liberties, and freedom", the Court further opined. 
Interference with right to privacy must take place only when it is proportional and is absolutely necessary for protecting national security/interest 
The Bench further enumerated that the State must at all times strive to achieve a balance between State's duty to protect national interests and infringement of privacy of citizens. Citing an instance, the Court lamented that in today's world, information gathered by intelligence agencies through surveillance is essential for the fight against violence and terror. However, any interference with the right to privacy of an individual must be carried out 'only when it is absolutely necessary for protecting national security/interest and is proportional', the Court highlighted. The considerations for usage of such alleged technology, ought to be evidence based, it was further noted. 
It may be noted that during prior hearings, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had argued before the Bench that the instant matter was related to national security, and hence cannot be made a subject matter of a judicial debate or public discourse. He had further expressed the Centre's unwillingness to file any additional affidavit divulging whether the Centre had used any particular software for security purposes by citing concerns of national security. 
Surveillance causes chilling effect on the freedom of press which is an important pillar of democracy 
The Court further held that it is undeniable that surveillance and the knowledge that one is under the threat of being spied on can affect the way an individual decides to exercise his or her rights. This in many instances can lead to self-censorship, the Court pointed out. 
Opining on the effect disproportionate State surveillance can have on the freedom of press, the Court remarked, 
"This is of particular concern when it relates to the freedom of the press, which is an important pillar of democracy. Such chilling effect on the freedom of speech is an assault on the vital public-watchdog role of the press, which may undermine the ability of the press to provide accurate and reliable information."
The Bench thus noted that it is compelled to 'take up the cause to determine the truth and get to the bottom of the allegations' in light of the pressing need to protect journalistic sources for press freedom in a democratic society and the potential chilling effect that snooping techniques may have.

Case Title : Manohar Lal Sharma versus Union of India and connected cases

The Karnataka High Court has held that even if the plaintiff has not sought a relief of possession in a suit for specific performance, but had only sought the prayer for execution of the sale deed, the Execution Court can issue a delivery warrant directing the Judgment debtor to handover possession of the property, upon decree holder performing all obligations as stated in decree.
 A single judge bench of Justice Suraj Govindaraj sitting at Dharwad said, "Such an order would be within the purview of Subsection (3) of Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 and would not amount to going beyond the decree for specific performance."
 The bench held thus while dismissing a petition filed by one Dada challenging an order passed by the Execution court allowing an application made by the decree holder and issuing a delivery warrant against the judgment debtor in respect of the subject suit property.
 Case details:
 The respondents (original plaintiffs) had filed a suit against the petitioners herein seeking a decree of specific performance and a direction to the petitioners herein to execute a sale deed in respect of the suit land as per the agreement of sale. The same was decreed vide Judgment dated 26.06.2013 and an application preferred by the petitioners under Order 9 Rule 13 of CPC seeking for setting aside the Judgment also came to be dismissed. 
The respondents herein then filed Execution Proceedings. An application was also filed seeking issuance of delivery warrant as regards the possession of the property. The execution court allowed the same.
 Aggrieved thereof, instant proceedings were initiated by the original defendants. Advocate Surabhi Kulkarni argued that the impugned order violates principles of natural justice. He submitted that a delivery warrant in respect of possession could not have been issued without a specific prayer having been sought for in the suit. Further, there being no decree directing handing over of possession, issuance of delivery warrant would amount to going beyond the decree which is impermissible.
 Advocate Arun P. Bolaji for the Respondent herein argued that there is no requirement as such for a plaintiff in a suit to specifically seek for possession. The execution Court can always in furtherance of getting sale deed executed in favour of the decree holder direct handing over of possession.
 Findings:
 The bench observed that Section 22(1) of SRA provides the manner and nature of relief that could be sought for by the plaintiff. Section 22(2) provides that the reliefs which have been sought for in sub-clause (a) and (c) of Section 22(1) of the Act cannot be granted unless it has been specifically claimed. The proviso, however, provides an opportunity to the plaintiff to seek the said relief at any stage of the proceedings of the suit if not already sought by way of amendment to include such a claim or relief.
 It then observed, "it is clear that unless the relief of possession or partition and separate possession of the property in addition to performance is sought for, no such relief can be granted."
 Then the court adverted to Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act and said "A perusal of Sub-section (3) of Section 28 indicates that if the purchaser or lessee pays the purchase money as directed, then such a purchaser would be entitled to the execution of the proper conveyance or lease, delivery of possession or partition and separate possession and further that no separate suit in respect of any relief which could be claimed under the Section would lie at the instance of the vendor, purchaser, lessor or lessee."
 Following which it held, "The decree-holder having paid the consideration amount and having complied with the directions issued in the decree, I am of the considered opinion cannot be deprived of possession of the property inasmuch as the mere execution of a sale deed would confer no right on the purchaser/decree holder and the title of the purchaser would only remain on paper without the purchaser being entitled to make use of the property subject matter of the decree, despite having made payment of valuable consideration for the same."
 Accordingly it dismissed the petition.

The Bombay High Court has ruled that once a settlement is arrived at by the parties, the contract between the parties stands discharged by mutual agreement and hence, the dispute arising under the said contract is a deadwood which cannot be referred to arbitration.

The Bombay High Court has ruled that once a settlement is arrived at by the parties, the contract between the parties stands discharged by mutual agreement and hence, the dispute arising under the said contract is a deadwood which cannot be referred to arbitration. 
Observing that a party who conceals or suppresses facts, including the factum of a settlement, is disentitled to relief under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act), the Single Bench of Justice G.S. Kulkarni held that a party cannot be allowed to resurrect the dead issues and foist an unwarranted arbitration after the contract between them stood discharged by a complete accord and satisfaction in terms of the settlement agreement arrived between them.
 The applicant Vishwajit Sud & Co. and the respondent L & T Stec JV entered into Sub-Contract Agreements, under which the applicant was appointed as a sub-contractor. After the respondent allegedly refused to make payments for the work done by the applicant, the applicant issued a notice invoking the arbitration clause. The respondent, in its reply to the said notice, contended that a settlement was arrived at between the parties and therefore, the contract between the parties was discharged. The respondent averred that once a contract was discharged by way of settlement, neither the contract nor any dispute arising under the contract survived.
 Consequently, the applicant filed an application under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act) before the Bombay High Court for appointment of an Arbitral Tribunal.
 The respondent- L & T Stec JV submitted before the High Court that a Settlement Agreement was executed by the parties and all the disputes under the Contract were put to an end, which was deliberately suppressed by the applicant in its application under Section 11 of the A&C act.
 The applicant Vishwajit Sud & Co. averred that the issue whether there was an accord and satisfaction arrived at between the parties is required to be adjudicated by the Arbitral Tribunal.
 Noting that there was a settlement arrived at between the parties, the terms and conditions of which were completely known to the applicant, the Court accepted the contention of the respondent that the applicant attempted to arbitrate a dispute which was absolutely a deadwood.
 The Court observed that eight months after the settlement agreement was signed by the parties, the applicant intended to wriggle out from the terms of the settlement on the ground that it was not an appropriate settlement and issued a notice invoking the arbitration agreement. The Court further noted that thereafter, the applicant issued a letter unconditionally withdrawing the said notice invoking arbitration and confirmed that the dispute stood amicably settled between the parties. However, after the respondent rejected the demand for further payment, as reagitated by the applicant, the applicant withdrew the settlement agreement and issued a fresh notice invoking arbitration.
 Rejecting the contention of the applicant that there was any coercion or duress exercised by the respondent for getting the settlement agreement executed, the Court held that the said bald pleas of coercion were made without any supporting material and that the conduct of the applicant was clearly reprehensible.
 Holding that no disclosure regarding the settlement between the parties was made in the pleadings filed before the Court, the Court held that the intention of the applicant to suppress materials and misguide the Court was clear.
 "There is thus a clear attempt on the part of applicant appears to be to wriggle out of the settlement and drag the respondent into unwarranted arbitration so as to resurrect dead issues. The Court cannot be oblivious to such conduct of the applicants in which considering the reliefs as prayed for as such conduct of the applicants is certainly not a conduct of a bonafide litigant."
 The Bench observed that the Delhi High Court in Sugam Construction (P) Ltd. versus Northern Railway Administration (2012) and in Fiberfill Engineers versus Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (2016) has held that the party who conceals or suppresses facts is disentitled to relief under Section 11 of the A&C Act and that on such ground itself, the proceedings under Section 11 are liable to be dismissed.
 The Bench held that it was a clear case of accord and satisfaction, wherein the parties under the settlement agreement had decided to discharge the contract in full and final settlement.
 "The legal position which would be brought about by virtue of a settlement agreement as entered between the parties is that such settlement would discharge the contract by mutual agreement which is a process akin to the process the parties having entered into a contract, thereafter decide to discharge the contract by mutual agreement. Such eventuality is well-known in common law as accord and satisfaction by substituted agreement.", the Court said.
 Further, the Court noted that the Supreme Court in Union of India versus Kishorilal Gupta & Bros. (1959) had held that when there is an accord and satisfaction, the arbitration clause itself would perish with the original contract. The Apex Court had ruled that it is for the Court to decide in the facts of the case before it as to whether any cause of action at all would survive, not only under the contract but also under the arbitration agreement.
 Additionally, in view of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Union of India & Ors. versus Master Construction Company (2011), the Court observed that where the dispute raised by the claimant with regard to the validity of the discharge voucher or no-claim certificate or the settlement agreement, prima facie, appears to be lacking in credibility, the dispute is not required to be referred to arbitration at all.
 "Adverting to the position in law as being consistently held by the Supreme Court in the decisions as noted above, in the facts of the present case, it is crystal clear that the applicants with open eyes had entered into a settlement agreement with the respondent. If there was to be any apprehension of a fraud, coercion, undue influence or duress, the settlement agreement which was conceived on 31 October, 2020 could not have have ever been signed by the applicants on 2 July, 2021", the Court said.
 Holding that the allegations of coercion were ex facie false which did not require adjudication, the Court ruled that in view of the complete accord and satisfaction in terms of the settlement agreement arrived at by the parties, the contract itself stood discharged.
 The Court ruled that the applicant was attempting to resurrect the dead issues and foist an unwarranted arbitration on the respondent. Thus, the Bench dismissed the applications and imposed a cost of Rs. 50,000/- on the applicant for each of the applications filed by it.

The prescription of a Higher educational qualification as a qualification for promotion to a post cannot be held as violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has reiterated.
The bench headed by the Chief Justice of India SA Bobde observed thus while setting aside a Judgment of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court which quashed  an administrative Order of the Chief Justice prescribing certain qualifications for promotion to the post of Head Assistant.
One of the reasons for quashing given by the High Court was that all persons working as Senior Assistants constituted a homogenous group and hence there cannot be any differentiation among them on the basis of educational qualifications. Before the Apex Court, the aggrieved parties contended that a classification is permissible on the basis of educational qualifications, even within a homogenous group, for the purpose of promotion to a higher post.
To answer this, the bench, also comprising of Justices AS Bopanna and V. Ramasubramanian, referred to a 1968 Constitution Bench Judgment viz. State of Mysore & Anr. vs. P. Narasinga Rao  AIR 1968 SC 349, in which it was observed that Article 16(1) does not bar a reasonable classification of employees or reasonable test for their selection. The court further noted that in Jammu & Kashmir vs. Triloki Nath Khosa (1974) 1 SCC 19, it was held that the Rule providing for graduates to be eligible for promotion to the exclusion of diploma holders is not violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Further referring to T.R. Kothandaraman vs. Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (1994) 6 SCC 282, the bench observed:
"The legal position in this regard was summarised as follows:­ (i) Higher educational qualification is a permissible basis of classification, acceptability of which will depend on the facts and circumstances; (ii) Higher educational qualification can be the basis not only for barring promotion, but also for restricting the scope of promotion; (iii) restriction placed cannot however go to the extent of seriously jeopardising the chances of promotion."
While allowing the appeal, the bench further observed:
As pointed out in T.R.Kothandaraman (supra), the Court shall have to be conscious about the need for maintaining efficiency in service, while judging the validity of the classification. Though the High Court took note of these decisions, the High Court fell into an error in thinking that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court could not establish the necessity for higher qualification for the efficient discharge of the functions of higher posts. It is apparent from the facts and circumstances of the case that the non graduates have had opportunities to qualify themselves, which they have also done. Therefore, the prescription of graduation as a qualification for promotion to the post of Head Assistant cannot be held as violative of Articles 14 and 16.

Cracking the whip against revenue authorities who failed to execute MahaRERA orders in favour of a flat purchaser, the Bombay High Court directed the attachment and sale of a builder's property within merely 15 days if settlement talks fail.
 A division bench of Justices SV Gangapurwala and MG Sewlikar said, 
 "If within a period of two months settlement between Petitioner and Respondent Nos.5 to 8 is not arrived at then immediately within 15 days the Tahasildar/Competent Revenue Authority shall execute the recovery warrant as per the provisions of Maharashtra Land Revenue Code by attaching and selling the property of the Respondents."
 The bench added that shouldn't be any "laxity on the part of the Authority in executing the said recovery certificates" based on MahaRERA for execution of recovery certificates by selling a builder's properties to pay a flat purchaser. This is the last resort left for a flat buyer to recover his/her money. 
 The court was hearing a clutch of petitions by original flat purchasers against the developer and revenue authorities. One of them, Ansari Zaki had initially approached MAHARera for refund of the part payment for his 710 sq fleet flat in Malad as the builder hadn't received permissions for starting development for a considerable period of time. 
 On June 18, 2019 MAHARera ordered the builder to refund of the amount over Rs. 27 lakhs with 10.75% simple interest. In September, MAHARera issued a Recovery Warrant under section 40(1) of the Rera Act for over Rs. 40 lakhs, which included the interest component. 
 Zaki along with several other like him approached the High Court claiming that orders remained unexecuted. Zaki was represented by Advocates Manish and Nilesh Gala. 
 "The grievance is made that the orders passed by MahaRERA, Mumbai are not being executed by the Revenue Authorities," the petitioners claimed.
 The builder, Vidhi Realtors claimed that they has entered into several settlement agreements and could do the same with the petitioners and they would accordingly make payments in instalments.
 However, the court ordered that if the parties failed to arrive at a settlement within two months, the Tehsildar or whoever is the competent authority must dispose of the builders assets to pay off the flat purchasers.

The Supreme Court observed that a writ petition challenging proceedings under SARFAESI Act initiated by private banks/Asset Reconstruction Companies is not maintainable."If proceedings are initiated under the SARFAESI Act and/or any proposed action is to be taken and the borrower is aggrieved by any of the actions of the private bank/bank/ARC, borrower has to avail the remedy under the...
The Supreme Court observed that a writ petition challenging proceedings under SARFAESI Act initiated by private banks/Asset Reconstruction Companies is not maintainable.
"If proceedings are initiated under the SARFAESI Act and/or any proposed action is to be taken and the borrower is aggrieved by any of the actions of the private bank/bank/ARC, borrower has to avail the remedy under the SARFAESI Act and no writ petition would lie and/or is maintainable and/or entertainable.", the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna said.
The court said that the activity of the bank/ARC (of lending the money to the borrowers) cannot be said to be as performing a public function which is normally expected to be performed by the State authorities.
In this case, the High Court of Karnataka entertained the writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India filed by borrowers against an Assets Reconstructing Company and passed an interim order directing for maintaining status quo with regard to SARFAESI action (possession of the secured assets). Challenging this, the Assets Reconstructing Company (ARC) preferred appeals before the Apex Court.
The ARCs contended that the writ petitions against the private party – ARC and that too against the communication proposing to take action under the SARFAESI Act would not be maintainable at all, and, therefore, the High Court ought not to have entertained such writ petitions and ought not to have granted the interim protection to the borrower. On the other hand, the borrowers contended that the ARC to act fairly while dealing with the security so as to secure the interest of the borrower as well as public at large (depositors). As the ARC has not performed the statutory duty cast upon it and there is a contravention of the statutory duty imposed under the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002, a writ would lie against ARC against such an illegal action, it was contended.
 Agreeing with the contention raised by the ARC, the Apex Court bench observed thus:
12....It is required to be noted that a writ petition against the private financial institution – ARC – appellant herein under Article 226 of the Constitution of India against the proposed action/actions under Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act can be said to be not maintainable. In the present case, the ARC proposed to take action/actions under the SARFAESI Act to recover the borrowed amount as a secured creditor. The ARC as such cannot be said to be performing public functions which are normally expected to be performed by the State authorities. During the course of a commercial transaction and under the contract, the bank/ARC lent the money to the borrowers herein and therefore the said activity of the bank/ARC cannot be said to be as performing a public function which is normally expected to be performed 21 by the State authorities. If proceedings are initiated under the SARFAESI Act and/or any proposed action is to be taken and the borrower is aggrieved by any of the actions of the private bank/bank/ARC, borrower has to avail the remedy under the SARFAESI Act and no writ petition would lie and/or is maintainable and/or entertainable. 
Addressing the contention of the borrowers that the Supreme Court ought not to interfere with the interim / interlocutory orders passed by the High Court, the bench said that the writ petitions by the borrowers before the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is an abuse of process of the Court. While allowing the appeals, the court observed thus:
13.2... The writ petitions have been filed against the proposed action to be taken under Section 13(4). As observed hereinabove, even assuming that the communication dated 13.08.2015 was a notice under Section 13(4), in that case also, in view of the statutory, efficacious remedy available by way of appeal under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act, the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petitions. Even the impugned orders passed by the High Court directing to maintain the status quo with respect to the possession of the secured properties on payment of Rs.1 crore only (in all Rs.3 crores) is absolutely unjustifiable. The dues are to the extent of approximately Rs.117 crores. The ad-interim relief has been continued since 2015 and the secured creditor is deprived of proceeding further with the action under the SARFAESI Act. Filing of the writ petition by the borrowers before the High Court is nothing but an abuse of process of Court. It appears that the High Court has initially granted an ex-parte ad-interim order mechanically and without assigning any reasons. The High Court ought to have appreciated that by passing such an interim order, the rights of the secured creditor to recover the amount due and payable have been seriously prejudiced. The secured creditor and/or its assignor have a right to recover the amount due and payable to it from the borrowers. The stay granted by the High Court would have serious adverse impact on the financial health of the secured 24 creditor/assignor. Therefore, the High Court should have been extremely careful and circumspect in exercising its discretion while granting stay in such matters. In these circumstances, the proceedings before the High Court deserve to be dismissed."

The Supreme Court, while issuing directions to reduce delays in the execution proceedings, observed that an Executing Court must dispose of the Execution Proceedings within six months from the date of filing, which may be extended only by recording reasons in writing for such delay.
The bench headed by former CJI SA Bobde asked the High Courts to reconsider and update all the Rules relating to Execution of Decrees, made under exercise of its powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India and Section 122 of CPC, within one year of this order.
"These directions are in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 142 read with Article 141 and Article 144 of the Constitution of India in larger public interest to subserve the process of justice so as to bring to an end the unnecessary ordeal of litigation faced by parties awaiting fruits of decree and in larger perspective affecting the faith of the litigants in the process of law.", the bench, also comprising Justices L. Nageswara Rao and S. Ravindra Bhat observed.
Till such Rules are brought into existence, the following directions shall remain enforceable:
In suits relating to delivery of possession, the court must examine the parties to the suit under Order X in relation to third party interest and further exercise the power under Order XI Rule 14 asking parties to disclose and produce documents, upon oath, which are in possession of the parties including declaration pertaining to third party interest in such properties.  In appropriate cases, where the possession is not in dispute and not a question of fact for adjudication before the Court, the Court may appoint Commissioner to assess the accurate description and status of the property.  After examination of parties under Order X or production of documents under Order XI or receipt of commission report, the Court must add all necessary or proper parties to the suit, so as to avoid multiplicity of proceedings and also make such joinder of cause of action in the same suit.Under Order XL Rule 1 of CPC, a Court Receiver can be appointed to monitor the status of the property in question as custodia legis for proper adjudication of the matter. The Court must, before passing the decree, pertaining to delivery of possession of a property ensure that the decree is unambiguous so as to not only contain clear description of the property but also having regard to the status of the property. In a money suit, the Court must invariably resort to Order XXI Rule 11, ensuring immediate execution of decree for payment of money on oral application.In a suit for payment of money, before settlement of issues, the defendant may be required to disclose his assets on oath, to the extent that he is being made liable in a suit. The Court may further, at any stage, in appropriate cases during the pendency of suit, using powers under Section 151 CPC, demand security to ensure satisfaction of any decree. The Court exercising jurisdiction under Section 47 or under Order XXI of CPC, must not issue notice on an application of third-party claiming rights in a mechanical manner. Further, the Court should refrain from entertaining any such application(s) that has already been considered by the Court while adjudicating the suit or which raises any such issue which otherwise could have been raised and determined during adjudication of suit if due diligence was exercised by the applicant.The Court should allow taking of evidence during the execution proceedings only in exceptional and rare cases where the question of fact could not be decided by resorting to any other expeditious method like appointment of Commissioner or calling for electronic materials including photographs or video with affidavits.  The Court must in appropriate cases where it finds the objection or resistance or claim to be frivolous or mala fide, resort to Sub-rule (2) of Rule 98 of Order XXI as well as grant compensatory costs in accordance with Section 35A.  Under section 60 of CPC the term "…in name of the judgment- debtor or by another person in trust for him or on his behalf" should be read liberally to incorporate any other person from whom he may have the ability to derive share, profit or property. The Executing Court must dispose of the Execution Proceedings within six months from the date of filing, which may be extended only by recording reasons in writing for such delay.  The Executing Court may on satisfaction of the fact that it is not possible to execute the decree without police assistance, direct the concerned Police Station to provide police assistance to such officials who are working towards execution of the decree. Further, in case an offence against the public servant while discharging his duties is brought to the knowledge of the Court, the same must be dealt stringently in accordance with law.  The Judicial Academies must prepare manuals and ensure continuous training through appropriate mediums to the Court personnel/staff executing the warrants, carrying out attachment and sale and any other official duties for executing orders issued by the Executing Courts.
The court was considering an appeal arising out of an execution proceedings which is pending for over 14 years. While dismissing the appeals, the bench observed that these appeals portray the troubles of the decree holder in not being able to enjoy the fruits of litigation on account of inordinate delay caused during the process of execution of decree. The court said that there is steady rise of proceedings akin to a re-trial at the time of execution causing failure of realisation of fruits of decree and relief which the party seeks from the courts despite there being a decree in their favour. The court made following observations in this regard:
There is steady rise of proceedings akin to a re-trial at the time of execution
These provisions contemplate that for execution of decrees, Executing Court must not go beyond the decree. However, there is steady rise of proceedings akin to a re-trial at the time of execution causing failure of realisation of fruits of decree and relief which the party seeks from the courts despite there being a   decree in their favour. Experience has shown that various objections are filed before the Executing Court and the decree holder is deprived of the fruits of the litigation and the judgment debtor, in abuse of process of law, is allowed to benefit from the subject matter which he is otherwise not entitled to.
Judgement debtor sometimes misuses the provisions of Order XXI Rule 2 and Order XXI Rule 11 to set up an oral plea
The general practice prevailing in the subordinate courts is that invariably in all execution applications, the Courts first issue show cause notice asking the judgment debtor as to why the decree should not be executed as is given under Order XXI Rule 22 for certain class of cases. However, this is often misconstrued as the beginning of a new trial. For example, the judgement debtor sometimes misuses the provisions of Order XXI Rule 2 and Order XXI Rule 11 to set up an oral plea, which invariably leaves no option with the Court but to record oral evidence which may be frivolous. This drags the execution proceedings indefinitely.. This is anti-thesis to the scheme of Civil Procedure Code, which stipulates that in civil suit, all questions and issues that may arise, must be decided in one and the same trial. Order I and Order II which relate to Parties to Suits and Frame of Suits with the object of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings, provides for joinder of parties and joinder of cause of action so that common questions of law and facts could be decided at one go.
Ensure that a clear, unambiguous, and executable decree is passed in any suit.
We are of the opinion that to avoid controversies and multiple issues of a very vexed question emanating from the rights claimed by third parties, the Court must play an active role in deciding all such related issues to the subject matter during adjudication of the suit itself and ensure that a clear, unambiguous, and executable decree is passed in any suit.
 

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that a mere recommendation by the Selection Committee for enlarging the wait list, without there being a decision of the Government in accepting the said recommendation, does not give any right on the concerned candidates to seek enlargement of the waiting list.
 The observations came from Justice Sanjay Dhar in a petition whereby the petitioner had challenged the order whereby his claim for engagement for the position of Rehbar-e-Khel was rejected.
 Taking recourse to the available record the bench noted that the official respondents had invited applications from eligible candidates for engagement as Rehbar-e-Khel for District Kupwara wherein the petitioner participated and after undergoing the selection process he was placed at serial No.21 of the merit list. Accordingly the respondents issued a final selection list, according to which first 17 candidates were selected whereas a wait list of three candidates was also published.
 Court further noted that three candidates from the select list and one candidate from the wait list did not opt to take up the engagement, as such, two candidates from the wait list figuring at serial No.2 and 3 were engaged whereafter the Chairman of the Selection Committee, addressed a communication dated 06.0.2019 to the Director General, Youth Services and Sports, seeking permission to enlarge the waiting list to four number of candidates, which was not granted. This resulted in filing of instant petition.
 Dealing with the main contention of the petitioner that the Chairman of the Selection Committee i.e., respondent No.3, had sought permission for extending the waiting list by making it 25% of the vacancies and the same should have been done the bench observed that mere recommendation of respondent No.3 for enlarging the waiting list without there being a decision of the Government accepting the said recommendation does not give any right to the petitioner to seek a direction to the respondents to enlarge the wait list so as to include him therein and thereafter issue an engagement order in his favour.
 Buttressing the said position of law the bench placed firm reliance on the Supreme Court judgement in Sethi Auto Service Station and another vs. Delhi Development Authority and others, (2009) wherein SC recorded,
 "Notings in a departmental file do not have the sanction of law to be an effective order. A noting by an officer is an expression of his viewpoint on the subject. It is no more than an opinion by an officer for internal use and consideration of the other officials of the department and for the benefit of the final decision-making authority. Needless to add that internal notings are not meant for outside exposure. Notings in the file culminate into an executable order, affecting the rights of the parties, only when it reaches the final decision- making authority in the department; gets his approval and the final order is communicated to the person concerned".
As a consequence to the above discussion the bench concluded that the petitioner has been unable to convince this Court that there is a right existing in his favour so as to seek a direction upon the respondents to enlarge the limit of waiting list of candidates with a corresponding duty upon the respondents to do so.
 Accordingly the bench dismissed the petition for being devoid of any merit.

The Supreme Court has observed that the provision in Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, which requires the consent of State Government for CBI to exercise of powers and jurisdiction, are in tune with the federal character of the Constitution.
"Though Section 5 enables the Central Government to extend the powers and jurisdiction of Members of the DSPE beyond the Union Territories to a State, the same is not permissible unless, a State grants its consent for such an extension within the area of State concerned under Section 6 of the DSPE Act. Obviously, the provisions are in tune with the federal character of the Constitution, which has been held to be one of the basic structures of the Constitution.", the bench comprising Justices AM Khanwilkar and BR Gavai observed in a judgment delivered on Tuesday (11 Nov 2020).
The CBI, in this case, had registered crime against Fertico Marketing and Investment Private Limited and others alleging that the coal purchased under the FSA was sold in the black market. Later, it was found that the officials of District Industries Centre were also involved. The High Court dismissed their petition observing that the State Government had granted Post-Facto consent against the two public servants of the State Government whose names had figured during the course of investigation. It was held that the Post-Facto consent was sufficient for investigation by the CBI for the offences against the two public servants, whose names though did not find place in the FIR but were found in charge-sheet.
The contention raised in this case by the accused-appellant was that, in the absence of the consent of the State Government under Section 6 of the DSPE Act, the DSPE (CBI) had no powers to conduct investigation in view of the provisions contained in Section 6 of the DSPE Act. It was further contended that the failure in obtaining the consent prior to registration of the FIR would go to the root of the matter and vitiate the entire investigation. On the other hand, the state contended that the prior consent under Section 6 of the DSPE Act is not mandatory but directory. 
While considering these contentions, the Court noted that the State of Uttar Pradesh has accorded a general consent for extension of powers and jurisdiction of the Members of DSPE, in the whole of State of Uttar Pradesh for investigation of offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and attempts, abetments and conspiracies in relation to all or any of the offence or offences committed in the course of the transaction and arising out of the same facts. The same is however with a rider, that no such investigation shall be taken up in cases relating to the public servants, under the control of the State Government, except with prior permission of the State Government, the bench noted. The court also noted that a Post-Facto consent was given by the State Government vide notification under Section 6 of the DSPE Act to the authorities to investigate the public servants-accused.
"The cognizance and the trial cannot be set aside unless the illegality in the investigation can be shown to have brought about miscarriage of justice. It has been held, that the illegality may have a bearing on the question of prejudice or miscarriage of justice but the invalidity of the investigation has no relation to the competence of the court.....Even for the sake of argument that CBI had committed an error or irregularity in submitting the charge-sheet without the approval of CVC, the cognizance taken by the learned Special Judge on the basis of such a charge-sheet, would not be set aside nor could further proceedings in pursuance thereof be quashed."
While upholding the High Court view, the bench observed that there are no pleadings by the public servants with regard to the prejudice caused to them on account of non-obtaining of prior consent under Section 6 of the DSPE Act qua them specifically in addition to the general consent in force, nor with regard to miscarriage of justice. However, taking note of the fact that the High Court has not answered some of the issues framed by it, the bench remitted the case back to it for considering the said issues.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently termed the bane of live-in-relationship as a by-product of the Constitutional guarantee as provided under Article 21 of the Constitution, and has observed that such relations promote 'promiscuity' and 'lascivious behavior', giving further rise to sexual offences.
"Those who wanted to exploit this freedom are quick to embrace it but are totally ignorant that it has its own limitations, and does not confer any right on any of the partners to such relationship," the bench of Justice Subodh Abhyankar further remarked as it rejected the anticipatory bail of a 25-year-old man who has been accused of raping a woman, with whom he allegedly had a live in relation.
"The bane of live-in-relationship is a by-product of the Constitutional guarantee as provided under Art.21 of the Constitution, engulfing the ethos of Indian society, and promoting promiscuity and lascivious behavior, giving further rise to sexual offences" : Madhya Pradesh HC. pic.twitter.com/k63pXWrKiO— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) April 19, 2022
The case in brief
An FIR was lodged by the prosecutrix/victim against the accused-applicant alleging that she was friends with the present applicant and at one point of time, he called her to his room and offered her cold drink and after drinking of which she fell unconscious and thereafter he committed rape on her.
Allegedly, he also made a video of the same and subsequently, he kept on committing rape on her on the threat that he would viral her video with him. Further, it was also alleged hat the prosecutrix also got pregnant for more than a couple of times and got it terminated, allegedly under the pressure of the present applicant.
Now, when the prosecutrix was engaged to someone by her father, the applicant started harassing her parents, her uncle, and her fiancé and his family by sending messages, photographs and also threatening them that if the prosecutrix marries some other person, he would viral her videos and photographs.
Pursuant to the lodging of FIR and neing booked for offence punishable under Sections 376(2)(N), 328, 313, 506 and 34 of IPC, the applicant moved to the High Court seeking anticipatory bail.
Court's observations and order
At the outset, the Court noted that as per the case diary and the various documents filed by the applicant, it was apparent that the prosecutrix and the applicant were having live-in-relationship for quite some time and during this time, the prosecutrix also got pregnant for more than a couple of times and had to terminate the same allegedly under the pressure of the present applicant. 
The Court further noted that subsequently, things got sore between them, and when the prosecutrix was engaged to some other person, the applicant, being a jilted lover, resorted to blackmailing the prosecutrix and sent his video clips to the in-laws of the prosecutrix that he would commit suicide and for which they would also be held responsible together with the family of the prosecutrix. 
Calling the acts of the applicant 'serious', the Court opined the applicant had sent the video clips with a view to make sure that the proposed marriage of the prosecutrix does not get materialized. "How much stress his acts must have caused to the prosecutrix, her family members as also other persons is not difficult to comprehend," the Court remarked.
Against this backdrop, taking note of the spurt of such offences in recent times arising out of live-in-relationship, the Court dismissed the anticipatory bail plea as it observed thus:
"...this court is forced to observe that the bane of live-in-relationship is a by-product of Constitutional guarantee as provided under Art.21 of the Constitution, engulfing the ethos of Indian society, and promoting promiscuity and lascivious behavior, giving further rise to sexual offences. Those who wanted to exploit this freedom are quick to embrace it but are totally ignorant that it has its own limitations, and does not confer any right on any of the partners to such relationship. The applicant appears to have fallen into this trap and portraying himself as a victim, has assumed that once he has a relationship with the prosecutrix, he can also force himself upon her for all the time to come, having her various photographs and video clips etc..."
Case Title - ABHISHEK v. THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH

The Delhi High Court has observed that insistence of spousal consent for organ donation would impinge upon the right of the wife to be in control of her own body.
Interpreting relevant provisions of Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Rules, 2014 as well as Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, Justice Yashwant Varma further added that a spouse cannot be recognised in law to have a superior or supervening right to control a personal and conscious decision of the donor.
The Court was dealing with a plea filed by a married woman seeking to donate her kidney to her ailing father. The petitioner wife had alleged that although she was ready and willing to donate her organ to her ailing father, her application was not being processed since the respondent hospital was insisting on a submission of a No Objection Certificate from her husband.
It was further alleged that the relationship between the petitioner and her husband were presently estranged and consequently it would not be practical or possible to obtain the same.
The Court therefore observed that the insistence on spousal consent for organ donation would impinge upon the petitioner's right to be in control of her own body. 
"That right which is personal and inalienable cannot be recognised as being subject to the consent of the spouse. A spouse, in any case, cannot be recognised in law to have a superior or supervening right to control a personal and conscious decision of the donor," the Court said. 
However, the Court added that the aforesaid would necessarily be subject to the caveat of the competent authority duly ascertaining that the consent has been given freely and is an informed choice and decision of the donor.
On a reading of Rule 18 of Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Rules, 2014, the Court opined that the statute did not contemplate or mandate spousal consent being obtained. 
"At least such a stipulation does not stand expressly engrafted in the Rules. Rule 18 also does not envisage or mandate a No Objection Certificate being obtained from the spouse of the proposed donor. Rule 22, while prescribing that in case where a donor is a woman greater precaution ought to be exercised, also does not mandate a No Objection Certificate being obtained from the spouse. All that the said Rule requires is her independent consent being confirmed by a person other than the beneficiary," the Court said. 
The Court added that all that the provision in the said Rules mandate is the facet of independent consent being verified and confirmed "by a person other than the beneficiary".
The Court further noted the petitioner being a major, was clearly covered by sec. 2(f) of Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 which defines a donor to mean any person who voluntarily authorises the removal of his/her organ. 
"The petitioner would also clearly fall in the ambit of Section 2(i) as a near relative by virtue of being the daughter of the beneficiary," it said. 
The Court also relief on the Supreme Court decision in Common Cause v. Union of India & Anr. wherein while dealing with the issue of euthanasia, it was recognised the right of an individual over his/her own body and the same being inextricably connected to the right to life itself and the constitutional guarantee of dignified existence. 
"In the considered opinion of this Court, the insistence on spousal consent being obtained is clearly ultra vires the provisions of the Act. In the absence of any statutorily ordained requirement of spousal consent being engrafted in the Act, the Court finds itself unable to countenance the objection taken by the respondent hospital," the Court said. 
Accordingly, the plea was disposed of with a direction to the respondent hospital to process the application and request as made by the petitioner in accordance with law bearing in mind the statutory provisions contained in Rules 18 and 22. 
"The application of the petitioner may be duly examined and placed before the competent authority of the hospital. The Court only observes that the aforesaid application shall not be denied solely on the ground that it is not accompanied with a No Objection Certificate of the spouse of the petitioner," the Court added. 
Case Title: NEHA DEVI v. GOVT OF NCT OF DELHI & ORS.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has made it clear that a Sessions Court or a Children’s Court cannot entertain a revision petition against the order of Juvenile Justice Board.
Justice Sanjay Dhar observed that the power of revision under Section 102 of the Juvenile Justice Act is vested with the High alone. "No such power is vested with the Court of Sessions or Children’s Court," the bench remarked.
It added,
"Applicability of provision relating to the revision i.e. Section 397 of Cr.P.C. has been ousted by Section 1 (4) of JJ Act, read with Section 5 Cr.P.C. because the matters relating to the revision are provided for in the JJ Act, which is a special legislation. 14) In view of the above, the learned Sessions Judge either in her capacity as Sessions Court or in her capacity as Children’s Court has grossly fallen into an error by entertaining a revision petition against the order of the Juvenile Justice Board."
The pronouncement was made by while hearing an appeal under Section 101 (5) of the JJ Act, challenging the order passed by Principal Sessions Judge in a revision petition against order of the Juvenile Justice Board granting bail to the appellant.
 The appellant premised his plea on the ground that the Principal Sessions Judge, Samba, while exercising the powers of the Children’s Court or of a Sessions Judge did not possess the power of revision in terms of the provisions contained in the Juvenile Justice Act and as such, the impugned order passed by the Principal Sessions Judge, Samba is without any jurisdiction.
 In the instant case the petitioner was accused in an FIR No. 08/2021 for offences under Sections 376-D(Gang Rape), 366(Kidnapping & Abduction, inducing women to cimpel her marriage), 506(Criminal Intimidation), 323(Voluntarily Causing Hurt) and 212(Harbouring Offender) IPC registered with the Police Station, Vijaypur. After the charge sheet came to be laid before the Juvenile justice board, the petitioner filed an application for grant of bail before the Juvenile Justice Board, which was allowed and he was granted interim bail in terms of order dated March 10th 2021.
 Subsequently the respondents moved an application for cancellation of the bail before the Juvenile Justice Board, Samba which came to be dismissed by the Juvenile Justice Board. As a consequence both the orders came to be challenged by the respondent by way of a revision petition before the Principal Sessions Judge, Samba (Children’s Court) and vide the impugned order, the petition was allowed and the orders passed by the Juvenile Justice Board were set aside.
 After giving anxious consideration to the contentions of the parties, Justice Dhar observed that the Sec 101 & 102 clearly prescribe that any person aggrieved of the order of the Juvenile Justice Board made under the Act has a right to prefer an appeal before the Children’s Court within a period of thirty days. It further provides that no such appeal lies from the order of Court of Sessions passed in an appeal, the bench recorded.
 Explaining the law prescribing for a Children’s Court, Justice Dhar noted that as per Section 2(20) of the JJ Act means a Court established under the Commissions for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005 or a Special Court under the POCSO Act 2002 and in the absence of these special Courts, it means the Court of Sessions having the jurisdiction.
 Explaining the mandate of Section 102 of the JJ Act the court said that the revisional powers in terms of Section 102 have been vested with the High Court and no such power is vested with the Court of Sessions or Children’s Court as Section 1(4) of JJ Act gives an overriding effect to the provisions contained in said Act.
 While highlighting the overriding effect of JJ Act in terms of Section 1(4), Justice Dhar observed that besides Section 5 of the Cr.P.C provides that nothing in the Code can affect any special or local law or any special jurisdiction or power conferred by any other law in the absence of the provision to the contrary, meaning thereby that the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure would not apply to a matter which is covered by provisions contained in the JJ Act.
 Expounding further on the law applicable, Justice Dhar observed that since the power of revision has been exclusively vested with the High Court in terms of Section 102 of the JJ Act, the applicability of provision relating to the revision i.e. Section 397 of Cr.P.C. has been ousted by Section 1 (4) of JJ Act, read with Section 5 Cr.P.C. because the matters relating to the revision are provided for in the JJ Act, which is a special legislation.
 Observing that the Sessions Judge either in her capacity as Sessions Court or in her capacity as Children’s Court had grossly fallen into an error by entertaining a revision petition against the order of the Juvenile Justice Board, the bench pointed that although, in the title of the petition “revision/appeal” had been mentioned, yet the petition before the Session Judge had been registered as a revision petition and the Sessions Judge has treated it as a revision petition which is clear from the reference to the provisions contained in Section 397 of Cr.PC. in the impugned order.
 Commenting further on the impugned order, Justice Dhar also pointed that no reasoning much less a sound reasoning had been given by the Sessions Judge for setting aside the order of the Juvenile Justice Board. Merely repeating the contentions of the parties and quoting the case law and the provisions of law, does not make an order well reasoned, said the court.
 "Even though, the impugned order is running into twelve pages, but it is devoid of any reasons. Such an order cannot be sustained in the eyes of law", the bench underscored.
 In view of the same the bench allowed the petition and the impugned order passed by Principal Sessions Judge, Samba was set aside and the petitioner was directed to be released on bail in accordance with the directions passed by Juvenile Justice Board, Samba.

The Supreme Court set aside a Karnataka High Court judgment that held that a divorced daughter would fall in the same class of an unmarried or widowed daughter for the purpose of Karnataka Civil Services (Appointment on Compassionate Grounds) Rules, 1996.
The bench of Justices MR Shah and Aniruddha Bose reiterated that norms prevailing on the date of consideration of the application should be the basis of consideration of claim for compassionate appointment.
In this case, the writ petitioner's mother was employed with the Government of Karnataka as Second Division Assistant at Mandya District Treasury. After she died, the writ petitioner filed an application for appointment on compassionate appointment. That was rejected on the ground that there is no provision provided under Rule 3(2)(ii) of Karnataka Civil Services (Appointment on Compassionate Grounds) Rules 1996 for divorced daughter. Later, the Karnataka High Court directed to consider the application.The High Court interpreted Rule 3 and observed that a divorced daughter would fall in the same class of an unmarried or widowed daughter and therefore, a divorced daughter has to be considered on par with 'unmarried' or 'widowed daughter'.
In appeal, the court summarized the observations made about the grant of appointment on compassionate ground in earlier judgments including the recent one on N.C. Santhosh vs. State of Karnataka (2020) 7 SCC 617:
(i) that the compassionate appointment is an exception to the general rule; (ii) that no aspirant has a right to compassionate appointment; (iii) the appointment to any public post in the service of the State has to be made on the basis of the principle in accordance with Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India; (iv) appointment on compassionate ground can be made only on fulfilling the norms laid down by the State's policy and/or satisfaction of the eligibility criteria as per the policy; (v) the norms prevailing on the date of the consideration of the application should be the basis for consideration of claim for compassionate appointment.
Referring to the Rules, the court noted that only 'unmarried daughter' and 'widowed daughter' who were dependent upon the deceased female Government servant at the time of her death and living with her can be said to be 'dependent' of a deceased Government servant and that 'an unmarried daughter' and 'widowed daughter' only can be said to be eligible for appointment on compassionate ground in the case of death of the female Government servant.
"As observed hereinabove and even as held by this Court in the case of N.C. Santhosh (Supra), the norms prevailing on the date of consideration of the application should be the basis of consideration of claim for compassionate appointment. The word 'divorced daughter' has been added subsequently by Amendment, 2021. Therefore, at the relevant time when the deceased employee died and when the original writ petitioner – respondent herein made an application for appointment on compassionate ground the 'divorced daughter' were not eligible for appointment on compassionate ground and the 'divorced daughter' was not within the definition of 'dependent.'", the court observed.
The court also noticed that the writ petitioner had, immediately on the death of the deceased employee, initiated the divorced proceedings under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955  for decree of divorce by mutual consent. This would suggest that only for the purpose of getting appointment on compassionate ground the decree of divorce by mutual consent has been obtained, the court added. It also noted that at the time when the deceased employee died on 25.03.2012 the marriage between the respondent and her husband was subsisting.
"Therefore, at the time when the deceased employee died she was a married daughter and therefore, also cannot be said to be 'dependent' as defined under Rule 2 of the Rules 1996. Therefore, even if it is assumed that the 'divorced daughter' may fall in the same class of 'unmarried daughter' and 'widowed daughter' in that case also the date on which the deceased employee died she – respondent herein was not the 'divorced daughter' as she obtained the divorce by mutual consent subsequent to the death of the deceased employee. Therefore, also the respondent shall not be eligible for the appointment on compassionate ground on the death of her mother and deceased employee.", the bench said while setting aside the High Court judgment.

The Rajasthan High Court has expressed its disinclination to entertain a public interest litigation seeking direction to the Income Tax Department to remove all the defects and glitches on its official portal. 
The court left it on the administration to deal with the issues at its level.
 A division bench of Chief Justice Akil Kureshi and Justice Rekha Borana observed,
 "At this stage, we leave it to the administration to deal with these issues at its level. We are hopeful that proper resolution of the difficulties of assessees would be made at the level of the administration itself without the requirement of Court's intervention."
 The court added that the prayers made by the petitioners in this respect are rather wide and not specific. The court, however, left it open to the petitioners to raise these issues before an appropriate forum, if in future the difficulties persist.
 In the present matter, the Tax Bar Association, Jodhpur had pointed out various difficulties faced by the assessees on account of the official portal of the income tax department, which have various glitches.
 The primary prayer made by the petitioners was to issue directions to CBDT for extension upto 15 Feb 2022 of filing returns and furnishing tax audit reports. However, during the course of hearing, Advocate Vikas Balia, appearing on behalf of petitioners, apprised the court that the primary grievance of the petitioners has been resolved as Government of India had extended the last dates for filing returns and tax audit reports for the assessment year 2021-22.
 While declining to entertain the plea, the court noted that there has been across the board extension of last dates for compliances. The court observed that presumably, these extensions are granted because the Government of India had realised that on account of technical difficulties, several assesses may not have been in a position to make the compliances.
 The court also observed that there is nothing for it to presume that the administration is not cognizable of such defects. It also observed that proper steps for removing of such defects would be taken, so that the extension of last date for compliances does not remain illusory but the assesses can meaningfully take advantage of such extension.

Underlining that performing additional duties is not the reason for which a teacher is appointed, the Allahabad High Court recently directed that all teachers substantively appointed as such should function and perform teaching work first and only thereafter, additional work may be given to them in case of need.
 The Bench of Justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra observed,
 "It is only after performing of essential functions as a teacher that State can ask a teacher to perform additional work. Performance of additional work in no circumstance can be at the cost of teaching work by the concerned teacher/Headmaster."
 Facts in brief
 The Petitioner, a headmaster in a primary school was sent on deputation on the post of Zila Vyayam Shikshak in July 2017 and was working on that post since then. 
 Thereafter, in January 2021, an order was passed by the Director General School Education wherein a direction had been issued to all District Basic Education Officers requiring the games and scouts teachers/ physical education teachers attached at the block level to be relieved.
 It was so ordered so that these teachers could perform their primary function as a teacher in the school and only in addition to it, they may perform other functions. 
 A consequential order had been passed by the District Basic Education Officer, Chandauli relieving the petitioner from the additional work assigned to him on account of his deputation. 
 Challenging the same, the petitioner moved before the High Court stating that games teachers, in sufficient number, are otherwise available and regular functioning of the school was otherwise restricted on account of Covid-19 pandemic. 
 Court's observations
 Hearing the matter, the Court in February 2021 had observed that the order of the Director-General, School Education was clearly in aid of the cause of education inasmuch as teachers have the preliminary responsibility to perform teaching work and all other functions are only secondary.
 The Court had also remarked that the Director-General, School Education must examine and ensure that the order was implemented in letter and spirit inasmuch as the teachers who are either headmaster or teachers must be repatriated to their parent cadre and should be authorized to perform teaching work first.
 Pursuant to the Court's Order, on 15th March, the Director-General, School Education filed his personal affidavit clearly stating that all teachers, who were assigned duties of games and scouts activities, have been repatriated to perform their parent teaching work. 
 It was further stated that the petitioner had also been repatriated and has joined at his original place of posting as Headmaster of the Primary School.
 Petitioner's plea
 The petitioner contended that he was only games' teacher and his activity of teaching in school was not that important as of teachers who were to teach Science and Humanity subjects.
 It was also submitted that such teachers were given additional work and were also getting an allowance of Rs.2500/- per month, whereas petitioner's allowance was only Rs.300/- per month.
 Further, it was his grievance that there was no justification to repatriate the petitioner and the State had not treated him at par with other teachers, who were to act as academic key resource person.
 Court's order
 At the outset, the court observed,
 "Petitioner is substantively a Headmaster in a Primary School and his primary duty is to perform teaching work and to supervise the primary institution. There is no factual issue that petitioner has been repatriated to perform teaching work." 
 The Court further noted that his entire anxiety was to somehow get the additional work for which Rs.300/- per month is to be paid extra.
 Significantly, the Court observed,
 "This Court, therefore, is not inclined to entertain petitioner's grievance, inasmuch as the respondents have merely asked the teachers to perform their essential teaching work and not encourage allocation of additional duties as District Coordinator etc." 
 Further, the Court also directed,
 "The Director-General shall, therefore, ensure that other category of teachers are also not allowed to perform non-teaching work at the cost of teaching work, which is likely to impair the work for which they have been appointed." 
 Significantly, the Court also directed the Director-General to ensure that all teachers substantively appointed as such are allowed to function and perform teaching work first and only thereafter additional work maybe given to them in case of need. 
Case title - Vikeka Nand Dubey v. State Of U.P. And 4 Others [WRIT - A No. - 2679 of 2021]
Read Order

The Supreme Court, on Monday, dismissed a petition which challenged the delimitation exercise carried out for redrawing the Legislative Assembly and Lok Sabha constituencies in the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir
A Bench comprising Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice A.S. Oka passed the order in a plea, inter alia, challenging the delimitation exercise undertaken in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir pursuant to the recent notifications. Justice Oka, reading out the operative portion of the judgment, said that the judgment has clarified that the dismissal of the petition should not be construed as giving imprimatur to the decisions taken in relation to Article 370 as the said issue is pending before a Constitution Bench. Senior Advocate, Mr. Ravi Shankar Jandhyala, representing the petitioners had contended that the delimitation exercise was in violation of the scheme of the Constitution of India, especially Article 170(3), which had frozen delimitation till the first census after 2026. He had argued that the delimitation exercise was being carried out in the teeth of constitutional and statutory provisions. He had further submitted that after the delimitation order was passed in the year 2008, no further delimitation exercise could have been undertaken. The Senior Counsel had emphasised that post 2008, all delimitation related exercise can be carried out only by the Election Commission and not a Delimitation Commission.
Justice Oka had highlighted that though the Senior Counsel for the petitioner had orally argued that the provisions of the Jammu And Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 is in the teeth of the Constitution of India, the constitutional validity of the concerned provisions of the statute has not been challenged in the petition. While opening his counter arguments, the Solicitor General of India, Mr Tushar Mehta also submitted at the threshold that the constitutionality of the provisions of the Reorganisation Act have not been challenged in the present writ petition. 
The Solicitor General had controverted the petitioner's argument that the provision of the 2019 Reorganisation Act was not consistent with each other or the constitutional framework. It had been argued that the legislature intended the first delimitation to be undertaken by a Delimitation Commission and not the Election Commission, which is busy holding elections throughout the country. Mr. Mehta reverted to the submission of the petitioner that Jammu and Kashmir was singled out for the delimitation exercise, as is evident from the second notification whereby the Central Government had removed delimitation for the States of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland. Mr. Jhandyala had argued that the same was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Mr. Mehta stated that there were internal disturbances in north eastern States and thus they were omitted from the notification. 
The Counsel for Election Commission submitted that so far as the increase in number of seats is concerned, ample opportunity was given for raising objections, which was not utililsed and the delimitation order has now attained the force of law. 
In his rejoinder, Mr. Jandhyala had pointed out that when a Member of the Parliament had raised a question on the floor of the Lok Sabha asking when will the seats in Andhra Pradesh be increased in terms of the AP Reorganisation Act, the Union Government's response was that till 2026 it could not be altered in view of Article 170(3) of the Constitution. He also emphasised that the J&K High Court as well as the Apex Court in 2011, had upheld the freeze on delimitation in J&K till 2026. It had been also highlighted that, after the delimitation order of 2008, the Election Commission was entrusted with further exercises pertaining to delimitation. He had averred that the Election Commission had abdicated its duties.
The petition filed through Advocate on Record Sriram Parakeet asserted that the impugned Delimitation notification, which directed the process of delimitation to be carried out in UT of J&K to be done on the basis of the 2011 population census, is unconstitutional as no population census operation was carried out in 2011 for UT of J&K. The petition also argued that the Delimitation Commission does not have the power to carry out the exercise as under Section 9(1)(b) of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1950 and Section 11(1)(b) of the Delimitation Act 2022, the power vested on the Election Commission is to update the Delimitation order by making the necessary changes on account of subsequent events and the said power cannot change boundaries or areas or extent of any constituency by way of any notification. It argued that the Delimitation Commission cannot be established under Section 3 of the Delimitation Act 2002 as it has become inappropriate in 2007 when the Commission was wound up and after which the Delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies Order was issued in 2008. Since the delimitation has been completed and the Delimitation Commission has become inappropriate, the respondents are not competent to carry out the exercise now. The 29th Amendment to the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution in 2002 has frozen the delimitation process in J&K till after 2026. The petition contends that even when Article 170 of the Constitution of India indicates that next delineation exercise is to be carried out only after 2026, enforcing the delimitation process in UT of J&K is not only arbitrary but also violative of the basic structure of the Constitution. The petition also submitted that on 03.08.2021 in reply to Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 2468 - "The question was in respect of the provision in the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, to increase the number of seats in the Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Assemblies", the Minister of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs said "As per Article 170(3) of the Constitution, the total number of seats in the Assembly of each State will be readjusted after the first Census is published post the year 2026 ".
The plea also challenged the increase in number of seats from 107 to 114 (including 24 seats in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir) in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir to be ultra vires Articles 81, 82, 170, 330 and 332 of the Constitution and Section 63 of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019. It was emphasised that the change not being proportionate with the respective population was also violative of Section 39 of the UT Act. As per the Guidelines and Methodology for the Delimitation of Assembly and Parliamentary Constituencies issued on 2004, the total number of existing seats in the Legislative Assemblies of all States, including UT of NCR and Pondicherry was fixed based on the 1971 census which was to remain unaltered till the first census to be taken after the year 2026.
After the abrogation of Article 370, on 06.03.2020, the Union Government, Ministry of Law and Justice in exercise of power under Section 3 of the Delimitation Act, 2002, issued a notification for delimitation of Assembly and Parliamentary constituencies in the UT of J&K and States of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland. By notification dated 03.03.2021, the 2020 notification was amended - Delimitation Commission was extended for another year and States of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland were taken out of the purview of the said notification. On 21.02.2022, by way of another notification the term of the Delimitation Commission was further extended by 2 months, beyond 06.03.2022.

 Justice Gurvinder Singh Gill, while taking note of a large number of cases where investigation agency/prosecution choose to not file the supplementary challan against an accused if an application for anticipatory bail is pending, held that the investigating agency/prosecution must thoroughly examine the matter to consider whether a case even requires custodial interrogation in case the anticipatory bail application is dismissed, especially when the accused has joined the investigation and is cooperative at every step.
 The observation was made while allowing the anticipatory bail application of the petitioner, were charged with murder under S. 302 (Punishment for murder), S. 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information to screen offender) and S.120B (Punishment for criminal conspiracy) of IPC.
 While the case of Prosecution was that the petitioner had already given an extra-judicial confession admitting that she, along with her husband and her son poisoned the deceased and threw his body in the canal and petitioner's husband's brother had seen the petitioner and the co-accused near the canal on the day the missing report regarding the deceased was filed.
Advocates Anmol Rattan Sidhu and Pratham Sethi, Counsels for petitioner, submitted that the entire case revolved around circumstantial evidence, based on 'last seen' testimony and the ongoing property dispute between petitioner's husband and his deceased brother and other brother and thus, such weak type of evidence was not sufficient to connect petitioner with the death of deceased. 
Further submitting that petitioner was an old lady of 70 years who had a clean record, the counsels argued that the petitioner deserved the concession of bail.
 After hearing both sides, the Court concluded that this is a case of circumstantial evidence which is a weak type of evidence unless corroborated by other clinching evidence and giving due regard to the age of the petitioner and to her clean record and the fact that she has already been arrested and has joined investigation, the Judge accepted the petition, granting anticipatory bail to the petitioner, subject to the condition that the petitioner shall cooperate with the investigating officer and shall join investigation as and when called upon to do so and shall also abide by the conditions as per S.438(2) of CrPC.
 While parting with this above order, the Court also took cognizance of the fact that the supplementary report against the petitioner had not been filed till date despite petitioner's joining of investigation and because of this, the trial court proceedings against the co-accused came to standstill.
"This Court cannot lose sight of the fact that in case supplementary challan is to be filed against the petitioner and the trial Court by that time already examines some witnesses, the trial Court would have to indulge into repetitive exercise again of recalling the said witnesses for their fresh examination, which would result in adding to agony of other co-accused, who may be behind bars & whose trial would get prolonged."
The Court further noted that there would be several cases "where prosecution is able to complete its investigation upon the accused joining investigation without there being any necessity to subject him/her to custodial interrogation.'' 
And thus, the Court recommended that before deferring the filing of supplementary challan under S. 173, CrPC, the investigation agency/prosecution must thoroughly consider whether custodial interrogation is absolutely necessary in case anticipatory bail is dismissed and the investigating agency must only defer filing of supplementary challan under S.173 CrPC for specific and genuine reasons, not merely on the fact that an anticipatory bail is pending. 
To further elaborate, the Court gave an example of a case where modus operandi of crime is not completely known and Investigation Officer maintains the opinion that custodial interrogation is absolutely necessary to unravel details of the crime, that case the investigating officer can defer the filing of supplementary challan under S.173 of CrPC.
 The Court, thus directed, DGP Punjab, DGP Haryana and DGP UT Chandigarh to consider issuing directions in further cases, keeping in mind the recommendations of the Court in this case.
 Case Title: Sukhwinder Kaur @ Rajvir Kaur v. State of Punjab

The Kerala High Court held that the head of the educational institution would be held liable if any tourist bus, which does not meet the safety standards and standards prescribed in relation to control of noise, is used in any public place for carrying students from that educational institution.
"In case any contract carriage, which does not meet the safety standards and the standards prescribed in relation to control of noise is used in any public place for carrying students from any educational institutions, the head of that educational institution and also the teacher or teachers, who are in charge of that trip, who are least bothered about the safety of the students, shall also be proceeded against, in accordance with law," said the court.
The division bench comprising Justice Anil K Narendran and Justice P G Ajithkumar also said the entry of any contract carriage or other motor vehicles violating the safety standards or noise control norms or those with unauthorised alterations shall not be permitted in the premises of any educational institution in the State for any purpose including exhibition or auto show.
"Any such activity shall be prevented by the head of that educational institution, which shall also be reported to the concerned Station House Officer and also the Enforcement Officer in the Motor Vehicles Department, so as to enable them to proceed against the owner and driver of such vehicles," said the court.
In a pending matter related to the road safety, the court last week took Suo Motu note of the Wadakkanchery bus accident in which a contract carriage carrying students, who were on a study tour, met with an accident and hit the rear of a KSRTC bus. Nine people including five students and one teacher were killed in the accident.
After pursuing the accident investigation report of the case, the court said the contract carriage vehicle carrying the students was fitted with unauthorised lights, speakers and window curtains.
"The driver cabin was fitted with continuously blinking DJ rotating LED lights, multi-coloured LED/laser/neon lights in the passenger compartment, converting the passenger compartment into a dancing floor, causing distraction to the driver of that vehicle and also to other road users," noted the bench.
The court has further directed the Enforcement Officers of Motor Vehicles Department and the State Police to take strict action against the contract carriers which violate the laws and prescribed norms.
Suspend fitness certificate of such vehicles, mere removal of unauthorised fittings not enough; driivng license also to be suspended
When the matter was taken up on Monday, the Court, after considering the materials on record and the submissions made by the Deputy Solicitor General of India, Special Government Pleader and Senior Government Pleader said:
"...we find that a total prohibition on the use of contract carriages violating the safety standards prescribed in AIS-008/AIS- 052(Rev.1) 2008 and also the standards prescribed in relation to control of noise, is highly essential since plying of such vehicles on public place is posing threat to the safety of the passengers in those vehicles, and also other road users."
However, the court added that the procedure of permitting use of such vehicles after interception, with a direction to produce the vehicle for inspection within one week after removing such unauthorised fittings, cannot be permitted to continue as the same is flagrant violation of the statutory provisions. 
"A mere removal of unauthorised fittings in a contract carriage, without completely removing the additional wiring and other alterations made in the bus body, passenger compartment and driver cabin cannot make that vehicle as one, which complies with the provisions under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder for the purpose of grant of Certificate of Fitness," said the court.
The Court also said the bus body, passenger compartment and driver cabin of a contract carriage have to be maintained as per the statutory requirements in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules and Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules. 
The Fitness Certificate of contract carriages has to be suspended with immediate effect for a period of three months if the contract carriage is found to be flouting the statutory requirements under the Motor Vehicles Rules, said the court, adding that the owner of the vehicle can be directed to make the changes as per the requirements of the law within that period.

The Court also said the driving licence of drivers who drive such contract carriage in public places has to be suspended for a period of three months for a period of three months.
The Court has also said that stringent action ought to be taken against owners and drivers of contract carriages or other transport vehicles used in public places after tampering with speed governors.
It has further directed the Enforcement Officers in the Motor Vehicles Department and State Police to conduct periodic inspections during the daytime and night hours to ensure that no contract carriages or other transport vehicles are used in public places flouting the safety standards and the standards prescribed in relation to control of noise. 
Further, the Court has ordered that any contract carriage or other transport vehicles used in public places flouting the safety standards should be dealt with appropriately by initiating a prosecution, and such vehicles should be produced before the Jurisdictional Magistrate Court colour photographs and video of the bus body, passenger compartment, driver cabin and also luggage compartment
The Court also has directed the Transport Commissioner and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to take necessary steps to ensure that videos promoting rash use of motor vehicles are not being uploaded in 'YouTube' and other online platforms.
Last Week, a Single Judge Bench consisting of Justice Devan Ramachandran observed that recklessness on the wheel will not be tolerated and directed the Transport Commissioner to ensure strict enforcement of law on the roads to send a stern message to all the drivers that they will be held accountable for their actions.
The matter has been posted for 14th October for further consideration.
Case Title: Suo Motu v. State of Kerala & Ors.

While commuting the death sentence awarded to a man to life imprisonment, the Madhya Pradesh High Court referred to the jurisprudence laid down in Bachan Singh to observe that the accused was denied an effective hearing.

While commuting the death sentence awarded to a man to life imprisonment, the Madhya Pradesh High Court referred to the jurisprudence laid down in Bachan Singh to observe that the accused was denied an effective hearing. 
A Division Bench of Justices G.S. Ahluwalia and  Rajeev Kumar Shrivastava noted that no sufficient opportunity was given to the accused-appellant for placing mitigating circumstances on record. It was further observed that the trial court did not consider the grant of any alternative punishment or the possibility of reformation. He remarked, 
"For effective hearing under Section 235(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the suggestion that the court intends to impose death penalty should specifically be made to the accused, to enable the accused to make an effective representation against the death sentence, by placing mitigating circumstances before the Court."
Background 
The accused was found guilty for the offences under Section 363, 377, 302, and 201 of the Indian Penal Code, along with Section 3 and 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act). A death sentence penalty was inflicted on the accused of the charges as mentioned earlier by the Additional Sessions Judge & Special Judge (POCSO Act, 2012) on the same day.
Advocates Vivek Jain and S.S. Kushwah, appearing for the petitioner argued that there is no direct evidence in the case, instead the case is based on circumstantial evidence, and the chain of circumstances is incomplete. It was also argued that: (a) there are various material contradictions and omissions in the statements of prosecution witnesses; (b) no witness has proved last seen evidence; (c) DNA samples were not collected properly for forensic test and sent after delay; (e) pubic hairs of the accused were collected by cutting them with the help of a razor; therefore, the prosecution cannot rely upon the DNA report of accused/appellant.
Challenging the order of conviction, the accused-appellant argued that it was passed erroneously, contrary to law, and against the evidence available on record. Relying on Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (1980), the accused-appellant argued that the present case does not fall in the 'rares of rare' criteria, and thus a death sentence cannot be awarded.
State Counsel Rajesh Shukla and Rajiv Upadhyay argued that (a) the witnesses relating to last seen evidence have expressly stated the prosecution case, and despite being relatives of the deceased, there is no dent over the prosecution story; (b) the spot map prepared reflects the modus operandi of the accused and also reflects the intention of commission of the offence; (c) DNA testing has been done by following all precautions; (d) a doctor has proved the DNA profiling and has given specific finding regarding involvement of accused based on DNA testing.
They also argued that the judgment of conviction and sentence is in accordance with the law.
Findings
The Court noted that the present case lacks direct evidence; thus, reliance had to be placed on circumstantial evidence. In such a situation, where there is no eye witness, and the Court relies on circumstantial evidence, more caution has to b exercised while analyzing the evidence. Therefore, the accused's guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and the chain of circumstantial evidence should be so connected that it only establishes the accused's guilt. The guilt hold must be conclusive in nature and tendency.
The Court remarked,
"When the case fully resists upon the circumstantial evidence, then it is the settled principle of law that all the circumstances available against the accused should be so connecting that only inference can be drawn that it is the appellant/accused who is the author of the crime concerned."
On the question of the accused's guilt, the Court relied on several judicial precedents and studied the relevant provisions of IPC and POCSO Act to hold that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt and that the accused has been rightly convicted. 
The Court heavily relied on the Bachan Singh jurisprudence to decide whether the present case falls under the 'rarest of rare' doctrine. Noting that on the same day after hearing the counsel for the parties, the accused-appellant was sentenced with death punishment, among other punishments, the Court relied on Mohd. Mannan v. State of Bihar (2019), where it was held,
"Imposition of the death sentence on the same day after pronouncement of the judgment and order of conviction may not, in itself, vitiate the sentence, provided the convict is given a meaningful and effective hearing on the question of sentence under Section 235(2) CrPC with the opportunity to bring on record mitigating factors." 
The Court noted that no sufficient opportunity was given to the accused-appellant for placing relevant mitigating circumstances supported with an affidavit on record. Considering the young age appellant-accused, the Court also noted that the sentencing order does not consider alternative punishment or the possibility of reformation.
It remarked,
"The trial court did not attempt to elicit relevant facts, nor did the trial court give any opportunity to the petitioner to file an affidavit placing on record mitigating factors."
The Court further relied on Mulla & Anr v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2010), where it was held that it is open to the Court to prescribe the length of incarceration, especially in cases where the death sentence has been replaced by life imprisonment.
Noting the life possibility of a reprieve and/or remission of sentence after imprisonment for not less than 14 years, the Court chose against granting it. It sentenced the appellant-accused to imprisonment for life, till his natural death given the heinous, revolting, abhorrent, and despicable nature of the crime.

When it comes to saving a life, every second counts.Revisiting the concept of 'golden hour' in medical parlance, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the State Government to pay Rs. 5,00,000/- compensation to the husband of a woman who died due to non-availability of ambulance at a Primary Health Centre (PHC) and the resultant delay in shifting her to the Medical College for proper treatment.

Revisiting the concept of 'golden hour' in medical parlance, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the State Government to pay Rs. 5,00,000/- compensation to the husband of a woman who died due to non-availability of ambulance at a Primary Health Centre (PHC) and the resultant delay in shifting her to the Medical College for proper treatment.
 A Single Bench of Justice N. Anand Venkatesh held that while there was no negligence in treatment given to the Petitioner's wife at the PHC, but the delay in shifting her to the Medical College concerned, proved to be fatal, resulting in her death.
 "There was a delay in shifting the deceased from the Primary Health Centre to the Medical College, Asaripallam. When it comes to saving a life, every second count and delay by even a few minutes can cause the death of a person. Therefore, when it comes to medical emergencies, delay can never be condoned like how leniently we condone in Courts" the Court observed.
 It added,
 "Every Primary Health Centre is supposed to have an ambulance readily available to shift patients in case of emergency. It is an admitted case that the Primary Health Centre was regularly dealing with delivery cases and they have to expect an emergency at any time, and they cannot afford to run a Centre without an ambulance."
 Background
 The petitioner's wife was admitted for delivery in the Primary Health Center (PHC). After she gave birth to a female child, she suffered from excessive bleeding. The PHC, while treating her, found the need for blood transfusion and recommended shifting her to Medical College, Asaripallam. As there was no ambulance available at the PHC, the nurse had to call a 108 ambulance which took 30 minutes to reach the PHC, and the deceased wife could finally reach the Medical College after 1hour 15minutes, where she was declared as dead. As per the medical records, the cause of death was 'postpartum hemorrhage.'
 The petitioner's case was that he lost his life due to the non-availability of an ambulance and delay in reaching the Medical College.
 The District Medical Officer, Medical and Rural Health Service, Kanyakumari, and the duty surgeon denied the allegations of not providing medical help. Their submission was that the duty Doctor and Nurse jointly referred the patient to the Medical College and called for a 108 ambulance, which arrived immediately.
 Concerning the availability of an ambulance at PHC, the counter-affidavits stated that a 108 ambulance is not available in Primary Health Centre. It only has a Hospital on Wheels Vehicle Van, which functions only in the daytime to cater to the medical needs of people living in remote areas.
 Findings
 The Court highlighted the respondents' submissions that 4 to 6% of the cases can encounter postpartum hemorrhage during delivery and that it is a common cause for maternal deaths after delivery in India. 
 "It is clear from the above that the condition that was suffered by the petitioner's wife is not uncommon and unfortunately the wife of the petitioner falls under the category of 4 to 6 percent cases, who undergo such Complications", the Court held.
 However, it clarified that the woman's death could not be attributed to negligence on the part of the doctor attending her, as he administered necessary drugs as a first aid and attempts were made to bring the situation under control.
 The Court proceeded to hold that there was definitely a delay in shifting the petitioner's wife from the Primary Health Centre to the Medical College, which ultimately proved to be fatal resulting in her death. Here, the Court revisited the concept of the golden hour as given by R. Adams Cowley, meaning the time between life and death. 
 To emphasize the need for an ambulance at a PHC, the Court also relied on the case of PB Khet Mazdoor Samity v. State of West Bengal AIR 1996 SC 2426, where the Supreme Court gave 7-point recommendations regarding proper medical facilities for dealing with emergency cases. It included adequate facilities at PHC, upgrading hospitals at district and sub-district level to treat serious cases and specialist treatment, centralized communication system to track the availability of beds, proper arrangement of the adequately equipped ambulance. 
 Finally, it ordered the State Government to compensate the Petitioner to the tune of Rs. 5,00,000/, from a Corpus Fund created vide GO dated 04.09.2018 for the said purpose. 
 Case Title: T. Rajagopala v. State of Tamil Nadu & Ors.
 Read Order

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that an employee cannot be denied medical reimbursement solely on the ground that he had undergone treatment in a speciality hospital by himself, which was not at all recognized or approved by the State or not included in the Government order.
"The amount of medical reimbursement is constitutional obligation towards sufferer which is a beneficial legislation in a welfare State for its employees, therefore, the rules and instructions formulated should be construed liberally in favour of the employees for granting them the relief rather than to adopt the wooden attitude to deprive the person of his/her dues."
The observations were made by Justice Wasim Sadiq Nargal in a plea wherein the petitioner had sought a writ of mandamus commanding upon the respondents to settle down their medical claims in respect of the treatment provided to the deceased-husband of the lead Petitioner.
 The facts of the instant case were that the deceased, while performing his duties, got seriously ill and was shifted to Government Medical College Hospital, Jammu in the year 2009. Since his health condition continued to deteriorate, he was shifted to Apollo Hospital, New Delhi in the Emergency Wing where doctors attended him and he was advised certain tests to be carried out. On the basis of tests conducted on him, the deceased was diagnosed as suffering from blood cancer.
 Since the family of the deceased did not have enough resources to get him treated in the Apollo Hospital at New Delhi, he came to be shifted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi (AIIMS) in a serious condition where he came to be admitted in the Emergency Wing, where the petitioners felt that the response of the doctors towards the deceased was not good, as such, finding no alternative the deceased was shifted back to Apollo Hospital, New Delhi for chemotherapy.
 Adjudicating upon the matter, Justice Nargal observed that it is an admitted position that the husband of petitioner No. 1 has undergone the treatment for blood cancer from Apollo Hospital as is evident from the medical bills.
 Explaining the "BSNL Employees Medical Reimbursement Policy" which squarely covered the instant case, Justice Nargal observed that it is emphatically clear that by virtue of clause 2.2.0, an employee (including retired employee) and his/her dependants shall be entitled to reimbursement of expenses at the approved rates at all hospitals recognized from time to time by the management.
 "The aforesaid Scheme also provides for recognized hospitals/nursing homes and clause 2.2.2 provides that in emergency cases, the reimbursement would be allowed for treatment in non-recognized hospital with the approval of CGM for field office employees and concerned Director of BSNL Board for C.O. employees", the bench underscored.
 Vouching for a liberal application of the scheme the bench maintained that the respondents have to keep in mind that the technicality of the rules and regulations are not required to be followed just in a mechanical manner so as to frustrate the very purpose of the Scheme. Each case has to be examined on its own facts before taking any final decision and it goes without saying that to preserve health and medical aid in furtherance of the self preservation is a part of right of life as envisaged under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and in the present case, the petitioners are held entitled for medical reimbursement of their expenses, said the court.
 Fortifying the adopted position the bench found it worthwhile to record the observations of Supreme Court in Shiv Kant Jha Vs. Union of India reported as 2018,
 "The right to medical claim cannot be denied merely because the name of the hospital is not included in the Government Order. The real test must be the factum of treatment. Before any medical claim is honoured, the authorities are bound to ensure as to whether the claimant had actually taken treatment and the factum of treatment is supported by records duly certified by Doctors/Hospitals concerned. Once, it is established, the claim cannot be denied on technical grounds".
 Allowing the petition the court directed the respondents to process the medical bills of the deceased and release the same in favour of the petitioners within a period of two months from the date the copy of this order is served upon respondents in respect of which all the bills required have already been submitted by the petitioners besides completing all the medical formalities.

The Allahabad High Court recently explained the scope and necessary ingredients of an order drawn under Section 111 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by an Executive Magistrate.
It may be noted that when an Executive Magistrate, upon consideration of such information that there is a likelihood of a breach of the peace by a person, is satisfied that it is necessary to proceed against that person under the relevant sections (Sections 107 to 110 of Cr.P.C. as the case may be), then the Executive Magistrate has to first issue a show caused notice to that person under Section 111 CrPC so that he/she can be given a chance to negate the allegations or offer his explanation.
However, there are certain ingredients of this provision that are required to be fulfilled by the EM before he can issue an order under Section 111 CrPC against a person.
In this regard, stressing that the order under section 111 Cr.P.C. must be in a writing, the Bench of Justice Gautam Chowdhary further specified the following broad elements of an order drawn under this section:
The substance of the information received under Sections 107 to 110 of Cr.P.C. (as the case may be), Upon consideration of such information, he has formed the opinion that there is a likelihood of a breach of the peace and that it is necessary to proceed under the relevant sections (Sections 107 to 110 of Cr.P.C. as the case may be). He is not bound to draw up order under Section 111 Cr.P.C. merely because he has received a Police Report or other information, The amount of the bond to be executed, The term for which the bond is to remain in force, The number, character, and class of sureties if any required
Essentially, the Bench was dealing with an application filed under section 482 Cr.P.C. by one Titu with a prayer to quash the notice issued against him on January 3, 2022, by Sub Divisional Magistrate (S.D.M.), Bahjoi, Sambhal under section 111/110 (G) CrPC.
In the said notice, he had been asked to show cause why he may not be required to furnish personal bonds of Rs.50,000/- and two sureties in the like amount for maintaining peace and good conduct for a period of one year.
Challenging the notices, the applicant argued that in the notice, it had been mentioned that he is an addicted gambler and person of criminal in nature, however, it didn't contain the details of the criminal charges pending against him and even the substance of the information against him had not been mentioned.
At the outset, the Court stressed that while issuing an order under Section 111 CrPC, the first thing that a Magistrate must do after receipt of the information referred to in Sections 107 to 110 of Cr.P.C. is to apply his mind to such information and, if he is satisfied that there is ground for proceeding under the chapter, to pass an order in writing under section 111 Cr.P.C.
Now, the Court further observed that the basic object of the preliminary order being to give the person proceeded against an opportunity to meet the allegation made against him as well as the nature of the order proposed.
"The order contemplated under Section 111 Cr.P.C. requires application of mind and has to be prepared and drawn up cautiously and carefully in compliance with the provisions of section 111 Cr.P.C. and the order must contain reasons of the Magistrate satisfaction. The substance of the information is the matter upon which he has to issue show cause notice. If the substance of information is not given in the order under Section 111 Cr.P.C. the person against whom the order has been made may remain in confusion and may not be able to give an explanation," the Court added.
Against this backdrop, noting that the substance of the information set forth in the notice was vague and ambiguous, the Court allowed the petition under Section 482 and the order of notice issued by the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Sambhal, PS Bahjoi, District Sambhal under Section 111/110 (G) Cr.P.C. was quashed. 
However, the Sub Divisional Magistrate was given the liberty to draw fresh proceedings against the applicant in accordance with provisions of law.

The Allahabad High Court has stayed the decision of the Uttar Pradesh government to appoint 6800 additional candidates as primary assistant teachers in the state in addition to already appointed 69000 candidates.
The Bench of Justice Rajan Roy made it clear that the Government can't appoint more than 69000 candidates without issuing an advertisement regarding the same, since in the original advertisement issued by the state, only 69000 posts were intended to be filled. 
The case in brief
Essentially, in the original advertisement (for the post of assistant teachers) issued in December 2018, 69000 posts were intended to be filed, however, after all the posts were filled up, the Government had come out with an additional list of 6800 candidates. This very decision was challenged in the instant writ petition filed by Bharti Patel And 5 Others. 
Justifying its decision, the state government sought to explain the backdrop against which it came out with the additional list. It was told to the Court that certain reserved category candidates had filed petitions before the High Court in 2020, challenging the appointment made to 69000 posts pursuant to the December 2018 advertisement.
It was the contention of such reserved category candidates that since they had secured marks higher than the cut-off for the general category, therefore, they are entitled to be considered and selected for the unreserved posts.
Therefore, the State revisited the implementation of reservation policy and took a decision to issue a fresh select list containing names of 6800 candidates, and they are those reserved category persons who have secured higher marks than the cut-off for the unreserved category.
The argument of the petitioners
The counsel for the petitioners primarily contended that no appointment could be made in excess of the 69000 vacancies which were advertised initially in December 2018 by the State Government.
It was further argued that the correct course of action is that the writ petition of the reserved category candidates (pending before the Court) should be heard on a priority basis and if the additional 6800 selectees are, in fact, entitled to be appointed, then they be appointed and those who are not entitled among the 69000 candidates must be ousted.
Court's order
At the outset, the Advocate General for the State Could could not explain to the Court as to how if 69000 posts have already been filled up, these 6800 selectees would be appointed, against which post they would be appointed, and whether against one post two persons can work and get a salary.
Further, the Court noted that in the writ plea moved by reserved category candidates challenging the appointment of 69000 posts, the Court had only asked the State to file counter affidavit in the matter and the State was required to explain as to how the reservation policy has been implemented.
However, the Court further observed, instead of doing the same, the State officials issued a select list of 6800 persons in addition to the 69000 appointments already made by them without disengaging or canceling the appointment of 6800 candidates already appointed if they had secured lesser marks.
In this regard, the Court also referred to an Apex Court's order dismissing a writ petition wherein it was the case that vacancies in excess of 69000 which were not advertised on 01.12.2018 should be allowed to be filled up on the basis of the said selection advertised on 01.12.2018. The Court had explicitly observed that posts in excess of those advertised cannot be allowed to be filled up based on the said selection
Against this backdrop, staying the appointment of these 6800 candidates, the Court observed thus:
"Considering the fact that only 69000 posts were advertised, candidates in excess of 69000 cannot be appointed and they already having been appointed, one fails to understand as to what purpose the issuance of select list of 6800 persons, who may otherwise have been entitled to selection and appointment, seeks to achieve in the factual scenario created by the State, as, in no circumstances, persons can be appointed in excess of 69000 which were advertised. Now, it is for the State to decide what it has to do in the matter as it is the State which has created this situation but one thing is very clear that persons beyond 69000 vacancies cannot be appointed against such posts."
Lastly, the Court has now listed the matter for February 18, 2022, when the stand of the 6800 would be taken into account along with the petition already pending which has been filed by the reserved category candidates.

In a significant ruling, the Kerala High Court on Thursday drew up a set of guidelines to be considered by criminal courts while granting permission for the issuance of passports to individuals involved in criminal proceedings.
Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas while disposing of a petition filed by a man who was awaiting issuance of a new passport for the past 5 years, observed:
"The grant of permission by the Magistrate enabling an accused to travel abroad will be of great significance, especially since it will be a process of balancing the fundamental right of a citizen to travel abroad and the need to ensure the presence of the accused during trial."
The Court further noted that it is important to lay down parameters so that the decision can be taken in an objective manner. 
"Many a time, the consideration results in subjective satisfaction of the Magistrate rather than the required objective satisfaction. To avoid subjectivity, it is necessary to lay down the parameters that can govern the grant of permission for future guidance." 
Factual Background: 
The petitioner had lost his passport issued from Dubai while he was in Kerala. Although he immediately applied for a new passport, a case was registered against him for offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code and the Passport Act, 1967.
Thereafter, the petitioner was informed from the passport office that due to the adverse report on the pendency of the crime, the file for issuance of the passport was closed.
Almost five years later, he applied again for a new passport. The criminal case against him was still pending investigation even then.
Key Observations: 
The Court recalled the cardinal legal principle that an accused must be presumed innocent until proven guilty and that false prosecution can adversely affect citizens' future.
The Bench did not hesitate to comment on the delay in completion of criminal trials:
"This Court cannot also lose sight of the fact that criminal trials in our country take ages to complete, notwithstanding the efforts at reducing delay. Adding to all these, with the Covid-19 pandemic having halted the continuity of trials in many trial courts, further delay is a forgone conclusion and to say the least." 
As such, it was found imperative to lay down a set of guidelines to be followed while governing the grant of permission by the criminal courts for issuing passports to individuals involved in pending criminal proceedings. 
Guidelines:
The following are the criteria that decide if an individual should be issued with a passport while being involved in criminal proceedings:
(1)The stage of the criminal proceeding and the duration of time within which the trial may take place;
(2) The criminal antecedents and past conduct of the accused;
(3) The nature and gravity of the crime; offences under Statutes dealing with acts of terrorism and acts of smuggling should require a different consideration;
(4) In heinous crimes, if the court decides to grant permission,the period for which permission is granted can be limited;
(5) Chances of the accused fleeing or evading the trial in the case;
(6) Mode in which the presence of the accused can be ensured during trial, including stipulating conditions like providing the address/ change of address in the country of residence abroad, either with the Indian Consulate at the country of residence abroad or with the Court where the trial is pending;
(7) Since in cases where time is not fixed by the Magistrate while granting permission, the passport authorities are issuing passports only for one year, the period for which the accused can be permitted to travel can also be fixed by the Magistrate, while granting permission.
However, it was clarified that this was not an exhaustive list and that criminal courts may incorporate other reasonable safeguards to ensure the presence of the accused during the trial into the order granting permission if the circumstances warrant it.
Tracing the advancement of the laws governing the right to travel, the Court found it indubitable that the right to travel beyond the frontiers of our country is a facet of personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
Nevertheless, it added that however comprehensive the said liberty be, it is still subject to 'procedure established by law'.
After the Passport Act was enacted in 1967, a law came into existence which enabled denial merely on the ground of existence of a criminal proceeding.
However, the Government of India issued a notification, which is statutory in character, exempting citizens of India against whom criminal proceedings are pending before a criminal court from being denied passports on condition that the applicant produces orders from the court concerned permitting to depart from India.
The Court found that there was still lacuna about the parameters that govern the grant of no objection by criminal courts.
However, the Bench made it clear that it is for the legislation to fill the gaps in the existing system: 
"It is for the legislature to fill up the lacuna by recourse to its rulemaking power or through proper amendments, such amendments have unfortunately not been forthcoming. It is essential that till then there must be some yardstick to govern the grant of such no objections by criminal courts as otherwise, there is a possibility of the grant of permission turning into a subjective satisfaction rather than an objective one."
Advocate Saju S Nair appeared for the petitioner and the Central Government Counsel Jaishankar V Nair represented the respondents. 
Case Title: Thadevoose Sebastian v. Regional Passport Office & Ors.

Denying bail to a man accused of raping his fiancé multiple times on the pretext of their planned marriage, the Delhi High Court has observed that mere fact of being engaged does not mean that the accused can sexually assault, beat or threaten her.
Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma made the observation while rejecting the argument made on behalf of the accused that since the parties were engaged, it cannot be said that there was false promise of marriage.
"However, in this Court's opinion, the argument has no force, since the mere fact of being engaged did not mean that the accused could have sexually assaulted, beaten or threatened the victim," the court said in an order dated September 22. 
The court also noted that as per the victim's statement, the sexual relation established on the first occasion was also on the pretext of marriage.
The FIR was registered on July 16 under Section 376 (punishment for rape) and 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Charge Sheet was filed in the case on September 16. 
The victim had alleged that after being friends with the accused since October 2020 and having been together for almost a year, they got engaged on October 11 last year with the consent of their family members. 
As per the FIR, four days after the engagement, the accused forcibly established physical relationship with the victim on the pretext that they were engaged to each other and would be getting married soon. 
Further, the petitioner was accused of having mercilessly beaten the victim, in an intoxicated state. He allegedly established a non-consensual physical relationship with her on several occasions, which allegedly even resulted in her pregnancy. The victim was given pills by the accused to abort the pregnancy in February this year, as per the FIR.
The FIR further alleges that on July 9, when the victim went to the house of the accused, he and his family members refused to solemnise the marriage, which led to filing of the complaint. 
Calling the allegations made by the victim regarding forcible abortion by administration of pills as 'very serious', the court said:
"A woman who was yet unmarried may not have kept the evidence of same for reasons to save her honour."
Perusing the victim's statement recorded under Sections 161 and 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) as well as the charge sheet, the Court observed that the allegations levelled by the prosecutrix were serious in nature which showed that she had been sexually assaulted and raped on several occasions by the accused on false pretext of marriage.
"Thus, considering the seriousness of the offence, the nature of allegations and the fact that the charges have not been framed yet and trial is yet to commence, this is not a fit case for grant of bail," the court said.

The Jharkhand High Court last week took suo moto cognizance of an e-mail complaining about the negligent attitude adopted by the MGM Hospital, Jamshedpur as it alleged that a lady with 90% burn injury was left half-naked and without any proper medical facilities.
 Appearing before the Bench of Chief Justice Dr. Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad the sender of the Mail, Advocate Anup Agarwal informed the Court that the lady had died of burn injury and that that the lady was not kept in the burn ward and initially, she was simply kept on a bed.
 Submissions made before the Court
 Advocate Agarwal further sent some photographs of the lady, wherein, in one of the photographs, she was sitting on the floor beside the bed. 
 Advocate Agarwal also submitted that since she was not given immediate treatment by admitting to the burn ward and which caused the loss of her life.
 Further, appearing before the Court, AAG-II informed that there were 20 seats in the burn ward and 24 patients were there and no seat was vacant and, therefore, she was kept in the emergency ward.
 Court's observations
 Observing that MGM authorities do not have any element of compassion, the Court remarked,
 "They are not able to take a decision as to who should be treated first in certain circumstances and they are utilizing dilly-dallying tactics in the treatment. However, this is our prima facie observation as we are not at all satisfied with the information given by the MGM Hospital to the leaned Addl. Advocate General."
 Significantly, the Court also noted,
 "This untoward and unfortunate incident has given rise to several questions regarding the attitude of the Management of the Hospital, the facilities which are to be provided either by the State or by any competent authority to such Hospitals and perhaps it also shows lack of training to the concerned doctors and staffs in dealing with the situation as in no case a lady with 90% burn injury can be kept like that which is revealed from the photographs sent by Mr. Agarwal."
 Directions given by the Court
 The Court directed the Member Secretary, JHALSA to make an inquiry in the matter and submit a report to the Court within a period of one week. 
 Apart from that, the State has also been asked to file a counter affidavit answering the issues.
 The Court has also asked the State Government as to whether when the lady came to the Hospital with more than 90% burn injury, immediately any information was given to the police and whether the police has immediately lodged First Information Report?
 The Court directed the Hospital Management and the State Authorities to fully cooperate with the Member Secretary, JHALSA during the inquiry and the entire expenditure would have to be incurred by the State Authority.
 The matter was thus posted for further hearing on Thursday (25th February).
 Case title - Court On Its Own Motion vs The State Of Jharkhand
Read Order

The Calcutta High Court has recently dismissed a plea moved by Bus and Minibus Operators' Associations seeking the operators' right in the matter of determination of fares in a manner proportionate to hike of the market price of fuel on the ground that such fixation of fares lies squarely within the authority of the executive. 
The plea filed contended that the provisions of Section 67 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (Act) ought to be read down to give a handle to the bus operators to have a say in the fixation of fare structures.
Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya observed that the privilege sought by the petitioners for the operators of motor vehicles in having a say in the fixation of fare structure has to be balanced with the convenience of the huge number of passengers and consignors who use the road transport network regularly for travelling and transporting goods.
Opining that judicial interference is not warranted in such cases, the Court underscored, 
"..the domain of fixation of taxes in public transport is squarely within the authority of the executive and pertains to policy decisions of the Governments, both at the State and the Central level. Judicial interference, under normal circumstances, is not warranted, unless the very Constitutionality of the statutes are hit and/or the statues-in-question are in direct contravention of public policy or the like."
The Court further noted that there is nothing in the scheme of the act to divest the State Government of the power vested in it to control road transport and to determine the fare structure and that such discretionary power of the State cannot be enforced at the whim of the operators, whose primary interest would be to earn profits from their business.
Opining that the State must balance competing interests, the Court observed further, 
"It is for the State, according to its policy decisions, to balance the equities between the interest of the passengers/consignors and owners/operators, to strike the right chord insofar as the business interest of the operators is not hampered on the one hand and on the other, that the interest of the common citizens is not affected adversely."
The Court further emphasised that in a welfare State like the Indian democracy, it is also the duty of the Governments to protect the interest of the common citizens and that any alternative interpretation of Section 67 of the Act would operate to the detriment of the masses and be contrary to the intendment of the statute.
Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court judgment in Mangalam Organics Limited v. Union of India wherein the Apex Court had held that revenue and excise duty matters pertain mostly to the policy of the Government and ought not to be interfered with judicially at the drop of a hat.
Thus, dismissing the plea filed the Court observed, 
"In the event the operators have a hand in the determination of freights/fares, the very purpose of regulation of such fares and freights will be frustrated, inasmuch as the motivating factor for the operators would be profits, as opposed to the interest of the consumers."
Case Title: Asansol Mini Bus Association and others v. Union of India and others

The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday directed the State Election Commission (SEC) to hold a joint meeting with the officials of the West Bengal government within 24 hours and decide as to whether deployment of central paramilitary forces will be required for the peaceful conduct of the upcoming elections to the remaining 108 municipalities which is scheduled to take place on February...
The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday directed the State Election Commission (SEC) to hold a joint meeting with the officials of the West Bengal government within 24 hours and decide as to whether deployment of central paramilitary forces will be required for the peaceful conduct of the upcoming elections to the remaining 108 municipalities which is scheduled to take place on February 27.
The Court underscored that in the event it is decided that central forces will not be deployed then the State Election Commissioner would be held personally liable to ensure that no violence takes place and there is peaceful conduct of elections. 
The plea moved by Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that large scale violence and rigging of votes took place during the recently conducted municipal elections in West Bengal and accordingly sought for deployment of central forces for the upcoming elections to the remaining 108 municipalities. 
Elections to four municipal corporations – Siliguri, Bidhannagar, Asansol and Chandernagore took place on February 12. Polls to these four municipal corporations were postponed at the instructions of the High Court considering the spike in COVID-19 infections a couple of weeks ago.
The Court had reserved judgment in the matter on Monday. 
A Bench comprising Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj on Wednesday directed the State Election Commission to hold a joint meeting with the Home Secretary of the State, Inspector General of Police and other officials within 24 hours and decide as to whether deployment of central paramilitary forces will be required for the peaceful conduct of the upcoming elections to the 108 municipalities. 
"We direct that the Commissioner, State Election Commission will collect information in respect of the conditions prevailing in each of the Municipalities where the elections are scheduled and will hold the joint meeting with the Home Secretary of the State and the Director General and Inspector General of the Police within 24 hours and will examine the ground situation of each of the 108 Municipalities and take a decision in writing in respect of deployment of paramilitary forces by mentioning the relevant circumstances in support of his decision to deploy/not to deploy the paramilitary forces", the Court directed.
Opining that the State Election Commissioner will be personally liable if violence takes place, the Court further ruled, 
"If the Commissioner, State Election Commission takes the decision not to deploy the paramilitary forces, then he will be personally liable to ensure no violence takes place and free, fair and fearless elections take place in the municipality where paramilitary forces are not"
The Court also dismissed the reliance placed by the petitioner on the Supreme Court judgment in All India Trinamool Congress v. State of Tripura wherein the Apex Court had directed for the deployment of Central Armed Police Force(CAPF) personnel for the local body elections in Tripura. The Court stated that in that particular case after considering the ground situation, a decision had already been taken to deploy the paramilitary forces and subsequently the issue was only to provide additional companies of CRPF.
However, in the instant case, the Election Commission is yet to take the decision to deploy the paramilitary forces after assessing the ground situation, the Court highlighted further.
Names of aggrieved BJP candidates have not been disclosed 
The Court noted that although it has been alleged that BJP candidates have been prevented from filing their nomination papers however neither the names of those candidates have been disclosed nor have their supporting affidavits been filed. It was further noted that the name of only candidate one Rakesh Majumdar has been disclosed with the allegation that he was not permitted to file his nomination by the concerned authority. 
However, the Court observed that Majumdar had already filed a writ petition before a Single Bench of this Court which was subsequently dismissed since it involved disputed questions of facts in view of the existing constitutional bar. 
Conflicting material about alleged violence 
It was further averred that in respect of the already concluded elections to 4 municipalities, conflicting material has been placed on record about the alleged violence. The Court further stated that  even otherwise that material cannot form the basis for issuing direction in respect of remaining 108 Municipalities, as decision for deployment of the paramilitary forces in a particular Municipality is to be taken on the basis of the ground situation existing therein.
Appointment of IAS officers as independent observers
Pertinently, the Court directed the SEC to appoint independent observers as per the provisions of the Model Code of Conduct. The Court observed that given the nature of allegations in the petition, the SEC should appoint impartial officers of the IAS cadre as observers.
Use of Mauve Paper Seals for all ballot papers 
On the last date of hearing, senior advocate Paramjit Patwalia appearing for BJP had alleged that the SEC vide order dated February 11, 2022 has decided to use Mauve Paper Seals for only 138 ballot units for the Contai municipality. Accordingly, the senior counsel had contended that this increases the chances of rigging of votes. Addressing this concern, the Bench on Wednesday ordered the SEC  to ensure that Mauve Paper Seals are used in all the ballot units during elections of the Contai municipality. 
Continuing government schemes do not violate Model Code of Conduct 
The BJP had contended that the SEC had permitted the implementation of various State government schemes such as "Duare Sarkar" (government at doorsteps) and "Paray Samadhan" (resolve issues at locality) in the municipalities wherein elections are ongoing in violation of the Model Code of Conduct. It had also been alleged that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had conducted an event to distribute titles to freehold land among nearly 2000 refugee families living across the state thereby violating the Model Code of Conduct. 
The  Court observed that announcement or promise or commencement of any new scheme or project is not permissible but continuation of scheme is not affected as per the provisions of the Model Code of Conduct. The Court also referred to a communication of the District Municipal Election Officer dated February 3, 2022 seeking clarification about implementation of above two schemes in areas where the elections are to be held.
Accordingly, the Court directed, 
"we direct the State Election Commission to examine if the schemes have been allowed to operate violating the Model Code of Conduct and not to permit their implantation till the elections are over if they violate the Code of Conduct. Same is the position in respect of the distribution of title deeds. Though it has been stated before us that title deeds were registered prior to declaration of the elections but their distribution during the elections may influence the voters, therefore, the Election Commission is also required to examine it and take a decision. Let this exercise be completed within 24 hours."
Preservation of CCTV footage and other relevant records 
The Court also reiterated that its earlier directions in respect of preservation of CCTV footage of all polling stations and also the diaries of the presiding officer and register containing the thumb impression/signature of voters of all the polling booths in a sealed cover. The Court had previously issued similar directions in respect of the Kolkata Municipal polls which took place on December 19.
Liberty granted to file separate application seeking cancellation of concluded 4 civic polls 
The Court noted that the prayer seeking cancellation of elections held on February 12 in Municipal Corporations Bidhannagar, Asansol, Siliguri and Chandernagore cannot be pressed at this stage. However, liberty was granted to file a  separate application in this regard if so desired.
Background
In the plea filed by BJP, a host of directions were prayed for with respect to the elections of the remaining 108 municipalities- deployment of central forces, effective CCTV surveillance, establishment of an independent and impartial Observer, verification of photo identity cards before entry into polling booths, making the State Election Commissioner personally responsible if violence takes place. Additionally, the plea also sought cancellation of the elections that took place on February 12. 
The Court had earlier directed the State Election Commission to hold a joint meeting with the Chief Secretary and Home Secretary of the State as well as the Director General and Inspector General of Police within 12 hours and decide as to whether deployment of central paramilitary forces will be required for the peaceful conduct of the upcoming elections to the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation.
Opining that the Commissioner of the State Election Commission will be held personally liable to ensure that no violence takes place, the Court had further directed, "In case, if the Commissioner, State Election Commission forms an opinion that deployment of the paramilitary forces during Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation election is not necessary, then he will be personally liable to ensure that no violence takes place and free, fearless and peaceful elections are held in Bidhannagar."
The State Election Commission had subsequently decided to not deploy central forces for the elections to the 4 municipal corporations.
It may be noted that the High Court in December 2021 had dismissed an appeal moved by the Bharathiya Janata Party (BJP) against a Single Bench order of the High Court wherein BJP's plea seeking deployment of Central Forces for the Kolkata Municipal Elections had been declined. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation Elections took place on December 19.
The Supreme Court had earlier refused to entertain such a plea by the BJP seeking deployment of Central Forces for the Kolkata Municipal Elections, by asking the party to approach the Calcutta High Court for such a relief. "We cannot take decisions with respect to the requirement of Central force. High Court will be in a better position to know the situation", the bench comprising Justices L Nagesara Rao and BR Gavai of the Supreme Court had told Senior Advocate Maninder Singh, who was appearing for the BJP.

The Rajasthan High Court (Jodhpur Bench) has ruled that it is not obligated to provide the complainant with an opportunity of hearing while adjudicating upon a bail application of a juvenile accused under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015.
Justice Sandeep Mehta observed that a holistic reading of the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act indicate that the legislation does not direct the Courts to hear the complainant either at the trial stage, the appellate stage, or the revision stage, while adjudicating upon an application for bail of a juvenile accused who falls within the definition of a "child alleged to be in conflict with law" (CICL). 
"After analyzing the entire scheme of the Juvenile Justice Act, I am of the firm view that the concept of hearing the complainant in an application for bail of a CICL under the Juvenile Justice Act be it before the Board, the appellate court or the revisional court is totally foreign to the fundamental principles underlying the welfare legislation. The legislative intent does not give any such indication, which may require notifying the complainant before proceeding to consider the prayer for bail of a CICL at any of these three stages", the order read. 
Background: 
In the instant case, the Court was hearing a revision petition seeking bail for a young boy of less than 16 years. He had been lodged in the Child Observation Home, Dungarpur for the alleged commission of offences under Sections 341 and 395 of the IPC. His bail application had been rejected before by the Principal Magistrate of the Juvenile Justice Board, Dungarpur as well as by the Special Judge, Children Court (Sessions Judge and Children Human Protection Act), Dungarpur.
The Public Prosecutor had raised a preliminary objection that the plea cannot be heard without giving notice to the complainant.
Observations of the Court: 
The Court noted that a practice has emerged at the High Court of impleading complainants/victims as party respondents in the revisions under Section 102 of the JJ Act by virtue of a proviso to the provision which states that the Court shall not pass any order under the section, prejudicial to any person without giving him a reasonable opportunity of being heard.
Deterring such a practice, Justice Mehta observed that bail to an accused is an extension of the fundamental right of liberty guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of India. As a result, an order for bail cannot be deemed to cause prejudice to the complainant and hence would not fall within the ambit of Section 102 of the Juvenile Justice Act which advocates for providing the complainant with an opportunity of hearing.
"It seems that without any basis, a practice has been adopted of impleading the complainant as a party in a revision for bail of a juvenile under Section 102 of the Juvenile Justice act," the Judge remarked.
Furthermore, the Court noted that if at all it was the intention of the legislature to provide a hearing to the complainant, specific provisions to this effect would have been promulgated in Sections 12, 101 and 102 of the Juvenile Justice Act similar to the provisions enshrined in the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. 
Objecting to the recurrent practice of prioritising bail applications of adult accused persons over juveniles due to the misconstrued application of Section 102 of the Juvenile Justice Act, the Court remarked, 
"It seems that without any basis, a practice has been adopted of impleading the complainant as a party in a revision for bail of a juvenile under Section 102 of the Juvenile Justice act. Numerous instances have come before the court, wherein, in cases involving multiple accused, of which few are adults and one is juvenile, the bail applications of the adult offenders are decided much earlier, whereas the juvenile continues to languish in the Observation Home, awaiting service of notice on the complainant. This anomalous situation is absolutely unwarranted and has to be resolved by taking a pragmatic, legal and logical view of the situation." 
Accordingly, the Court granted bail to the juvenile accused on the condition that his natural guardian would furnish a personal bond and sign an undertaking that imposes upon him the obligation to ensure that the juvenile accused is kept in a protective environment away from the influence of habitual offenders.

In a special sitting held on 'Holi', the Supreme Court granted anticipatory bail to Jude Lobo, a Goa-based restaurateur, Jude Lobo, who is named as an accused in an FIR lodged by a Delhi-based woman alleging rape. A bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer held the special sitting to consider the special leave petition filed by Lobo challenging the order passed by the Delhi High Court on March 26 dismissing his bail application. "We are satisfied that the petitioner has made out a prima facie case for grant of anticipatory bail", the bench observed after perusing the FIR, statement of the victim recorded under Section 164 CrPC. "If he is arrested he shall be arrested on a personal bond of Rs 10,000. The petitioner is allowed to implead the complainant as Respondent No 2. Let it be done today itself. Issue notic", the bench ordered. 
In civil revision petitions filed challenging an order passed by Coimbatore Principal District Munsiff, Madras High Court has held that the power to issue writ under Article 226 or Article 227 is subject to the court's discretion even when an alternative remedy is available.

In civil revision petitions filed challenging an order passed by Coimbatore Principal District Munsiff, Madras High Court has held that the power to issue writ under Article 226 or Article 227 is subject to the court's discretion even when an alternative remedy is available. The alternative remedy in itself won't constitute a bar for the High Court to exercise its revisional powers under Article 227.
 The court also made a clarification that the Registry shouldn't have queried about the maintainability of the revision petitions in light of alternative remedy under Order XLIII Rule 1(r) of the Code of Civil Procedure, as against the order passed in the interim application by the Munsiff. Registry does not have such powers to raise objections on the ground of availability of alternative remedy under the Code of Civil Procedure or under any other statute.
 The single judge bench of Justice R. Subramanian was considering the revision petitions arising out of an order granting temporary injunctions restraining administrative committee from taking any policy decisions on appointments, change of correspondents and carrying out the day-to-day affairs of CSI Diocese until the conduct of 34th CSI Coimbatore Diocesan Council and interfering with the functions carried out by the current Presbyter and Chairman of the CIS All Souls' Church, Coimbatore.
 When the matter came up before the bench on the aspect of maintainability, the court overruled the objections put forward by registry and directed that both the revisions must be numbered and posted for admission on 17th December, 2021.
 The bench held that it is for the High Court to examine each case and take a call on whether court should invoke its jurisdiction under Article 227 or relegate the matter back to the civil court or the tribunal as the case may be.
 "…The constitutional Courts refrain from exercising the jurisdiction vested in them under the Constitution, if an alternative remedy is available to the party approaching them, as a matter of self imposed restraint or as a matter of prudence and discipline. Once it is held that it is for the Court to decide whether it will or will not exercise the constitutional power, it follows that the Registry does not have the right to question the maintainability of such petition, on the ground of availability of alternative remedy", the court added with respect to its supervisory powers under Article 226 or 227.
 Referring to the constitutional bench judgments in Waryam Singh & Anr.v. Amarnath & Anr. (1954) and Nagendra Nath Bora & Anr. v. The Commissioner of Hills Division and Appeals, Assam & Ors. (1958), the court noted that the court's 'discretion' would mean that o say that the court can say if it will exercise its powers under Article 227 in certain circumstances like the existence of an alternative remedy. Therefore, such discretion is quite different from saying that a party cannot approach a Court for invoking Article 227 since there is an alternative remedy.
 "It is one thing to say that the Revision is not maintainable and it is another to say that the High Court will not exercise the power of superintendence in view of the availability of alternative remedy. Even under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as this Court, have repeatedly held that availability of appeal remedy is not a blanket bar or total bar for invoking the constitutional remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution of India", the court added.
 While doing so, the court also placed reliance on Virudhunagar Nadargal Dharma Paribalana Salai and others v. Tuticorin, 2019 (9) SCC 538 wherein the apex court made an observation that the existence of an appellate remedy under under CPC will have to be construed as a 'near total' bar. 
 Senior Counsel R. Viduthalai appearing for the petitioner in the first revision petition contended that the plaintiff can seek the court's interference under Article 227 especially when it can be demonstrated that the trial court overstepped its jurisdictional bounds while granting injunction, and the availability of alternative remedy by way of an appeal does not automatically negate that option. He also referred to Waryam Singh, Shalini Syam Shetty & Anr. Rajendra Shankar Patil, 2010 (8) SCC 329 and Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chanderi Rai, 2003(6) SCC 675 to establish that Article 227 can be used sparingly in cases where it's necessary to keep the subordinate Courts within the bounds of their authority or where they have refused to exercise jurisdiction vested in them by law, i.e., something more than mere errors of law , manifest on the face of the record.
 Making special reference to Shalini Shyam Shetty judgment, the counsel had also argued that High Court even has the power to substitute an order while exercising its powers under Article 227, which the inferior court should have made.

In a recent case, the Bombay High Court reiterated that the work that a victim was performing before the accident has relevance to the determination of the question as to whether he is permanently incapacitated to perform the work.
 In the case, the applicant-respondent suffered an accident due to which he had to undergo evisceration of the right eye. The Labour Commisisoner under the Employees Compensation Act, 1923 in the impugned judgement and award observed that the applicant suffered 100% permanent disability, which entailed the consequence of incapacitating the applicant from working as a driver.
 Before the High Court, the petitioner (Insurance company) contended that the applicant's injury would not amount to permanent total disablement since the applicant has not suffered 100% loss of earning capacity. 
To the contrary, the respondent argued that the question cannot be decided bereft of the work which the applicant was performing before he met with the accident. With the loss of right eye, the applicant could not work as a driver any more, and, therefore, the learned Commissioner was justified in awarding the compensation on the premise that the applicant suffered 100% loss of earning capacity.
 Physical Disability and Functional Disability
 At the outset, the Court in its judgement observed that the distinction between physical disability and functional disability has to be kept in mind while determining whether the applicant has suffered 100% loss of income. It noted:
 "The aspect of loss of earning capacity which an injury entails is necessarily required to be determined keeping in view the distinction between the 'physical disability' and 'functional disability'. Whether the applicant is incapacitated to perform the work which he was performing before the accident is the question which the learned Commissioner is required to pose unto himself. If the answer is in the affirmative, despite the physical disability having been assessed at a lower threshold, an interference that the injury resulted in 100% loss of earning capacity can be legitimately sustained." (Para 29)
 The judgement relies on the Supreme Court's judgement in Pratap Narain Singh Deo Vs. Srinivas Sabata & Anr (1976) 1 SCC 289 wherein the Court expounded the meaning of "total disablement"- "It has not been disputed before us that the injury was of such a nature as to cause permanent disablement to the respondent, and the question for consideration is whether the disablement incapacitated the respondent for all work which he was capable of performing at the time of the accident."
 The judgement further places reliance on S. Suresh Vs. Oriental Insurance Company Limited and Another (2010) 13 SCC 777 where the Supreme Court had held that a case in which amputation of right leg below knee would render the applicant-driver unfit for the job of a driver resulting in 100% of his earning capacity would be a case of 'total disablement'. 
 The judgement then places reliance on a judgement of the Bombay High Court in Shaikh Salim Ramzan Vs. Ashok Beniram Kothawade & Anr, where the Court had considered the loss of earning capacity to qualify the extent of disablement:
 "Though under the medical terms, the disability is only 30 % but while computing the compensation the loss of earning capacity is to be considered as because of the loss of vision of right eye, the appellant would not be in a position to continue with his avocation as a driver. It is not disputed that the appellant was driver by profession. In view of the fact that he had to surrender his licence, the appellant would not be in a position to drive the vehicle and continue as driver. Going through the definition of partial disablement and the total disablement as is envisaged in Section 2 (g) and (l) respectively, it is evident that the disablement to be considered is with regard to the reduction in the earning capacity of the workman in any employment, in which he was engaged at the time of accident resulting in disablement. In the present case though the medical disablement is about 30 %, still the said disablement is of permanent nature and has rendered appellant unfit for the work of driver…… The expression " incapacitates workman for all work which he was capable of performing at the time of accident resulting in such disablement " would mean the workman having been rendered incapable of performing that " work " which he had undertaken at the time of accident. The appellant being a qualified driver and was performing his duty as a driver, because of the loss of vision of right eye he has been incapacitated for all work as driver, he has been rendered unfit for the work of driver."
 Having canvassed the precedents on this question of law, the Court observed that "it is too late to urge that the work that the employee was performing before the accident has no relevance to the determination of the question as to whether the employee is permanently incapacitated to perform the work."
 In the present case, the judgement notes, since the respondent was incapacitated to undertake from working as a driver, the Labour Commisisoner was justified in awarding the compensation on the premise that the applicant suffered permanent total disablement and 100% loss of earning capacity.

The Gujarat High Court recently upheld an order of the family court refusing to waive off the statutory 6 months cooling period in a plea by a couple seeking a mutual divorce who lived with each other for a period of 12 days only.
The Bench of Justice A. C. Joshi observed that the family court rightly passed the order refusing to waive off the cooling period therefore, there was no requirement to interfere in the impugned order of the Court.
It may be noted that in divorce cases, a six-month waiting period/cooling-off period has been prescribed u/s 13B (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act. As per this provision, a couple seeking divorcee with mutual consent has to first establish a 12-month separation period, followed by a 6 months "cooling-off" period.
The Apex Court has already held in 2017 [in Amardeep Singh v. Harveen Kaur], that the period under Section 13-B(2) is not mandatory but only directory.
The case in brief 
The petitioner moved the High Court under Articles 14, 226, and 227 of the Constitution of India challenging the order passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Ahmedabad dismissing an Application filed praying to waive the cooling period of 6 months in divorce proceedings.
The marriage between the Petitioners was solemnized on December 8, 2020, as per Hindu rites and customs, but due to differences arising between the Petitioners, the Petitioners started living separately 12 days after the marriage was solemnized.
When all efforts for reconciliation failed, the parties, with mutual consent, filed a Hindu Marriage Petition before the Family Court at Ahmedabad. 
Both the Petitioners also entered into a Memorandum of Understanding ('MoU') for mutual divorce and that as per the said MoU, the Petitioners agreed to withdraw all the criminal cases filed against each other. 
The Family Judge firstly sent the Petitioners for mediation, however, the same failed, and thereafter, the Petitioners submitted an Application for waiving of the cooling period of six months, when the same was rejected, they moved the High Court with the instant plea. 
The petitioner primarily relied upon the ruling in the case of Amit Kumar vs Suman Beniwal Civil Appeal No. 7650 of 2021, wherein the Apex Court had waived off the statutory period of six months by exercising its power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India.
Court's order
Finding no illegality in the order of the Family Court, the High Court said that the petition had been filed by the petitioner under Article 227 of the Constitution of India and that the exercise of powers under such Article is imperatively spare.
Further, the Court also observed that the Family Court, Ahmedabad rightly considered that in the Suman Beniwal case, the Apex Court had exercised its power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to waive off the statutory period of six months and that the Principal Judge, Family Court Ahmedabad has no power to exercise such power under Article 142 of Constitution of India.
In the aforesaid factual scenario, this Court, while being in complete agreement with the findings recorded by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Ahmedabad, held that there was no reason to interfere with the order passed by it the court below.

The Gujarat High Court last week rebuked the state government for facilitating battles within a religious sect as it quashed externment order passed against two religious priests of the Gadhada temple on account of an ongoing dispute within the Swaminarayan sect concerning temple trust elections. Essentially, the Bench of Justice Paresh Upadhyay was hearing two pleas filed by the two priests of the Gadhada temple — Swami Satyaprakashdasji and Swami Ghanshyamvallabhdasji (petitioners) assailing the externment order passed against them by the Botad district authorities. The case before the Court
The petitioners claimed that they were externed for a period of two years from several districts – Botad, Bhavnagar, Amreli, Rajkot, Surendranagar and Ahmedabad by the SDM, Botad in the exercise of powers under Section 56 of the Gujarat Police Act, 1951. Significantly, both of them were externed by way of an Order, as per the recommendations made by the police, while taking into account the fact there was an ongoing dispute between two sides of the Swaminarayan sect (one belonging to Acharya Paksha and the second one to Dev Paksha). The Court observed that in the notice issued to them, and in the order passed against them, the election of the Trust, which manages the religious sect (Swaminarayan sec) to which the petitioners belong, was treated as a factor to pass the externment orders against the petitioners. Earlier, vide order dated June 15, 021, the Court had stayed the execution of the impugned orders. Court's observations
Taking into account the material on record, the Court, at the outset, noted that the stakes of the temple trust election were so high that there the matter even reached upto the Supreme Court of India. In this regard, the Court observed thus:
"This further fortifies the prima facie satisfaction of this Court that, the State, through its instrumentalities, has been facilitating the battles, including the legal battles, of one side against the other side, including by resorting to externment orders of the Priests of one group of the same religious sect." Further, considering the material on record, including the satisfaction of the concerned S.D.M. to order externment of the petitioners, the Court was of the view that by any parameter, the impugned externment orders are unsustainable and need to be set aside. "The glaring aspect is the high-handedness of the police officials, which is readily accepted by the Revenue Authorities through the Sub-Divisional Magistrate. In totality, these petitions need to be allowed," the Court further riiled. 
The Delhi High Court has refused to grant interim injunction in favour of Bolt Technology OU in relation to use of the mark ‘Bolt’ in EV (electric vehicle) charging stations in India by Ujoy Technology Private Limited.
The court observed that since Bolt is not engaged in providing EV charging services anywhere in the world and has merely installed some EV charging stations in a handful of locations for charging its own vehicles, no trans-border reputation in providing EV charging services can be credited to it which can be said to have spilled over to India.
"There is no justification, therefore, prima facie, for the Court to, by allowing the application of the petitioner, who has no market exposure whatsoever in India, and, prima facie, no spillover or percolation of its trans border reputation into India, to jeopardize the market, or the repute, that the defendant has earned by use of the impugned mark, for providing EV charging services," said the court.
Observing that Ujoy Technology is the first in the Indian market in providing EV charging services, the bench of Justice C. Hari Shankar said:
"In examining these aspects, the Court has to be acutely conscious of the cautionary note sounded both in Milmet Oftho and in Toyota, that the Court must not permit large multinational corporations, which have no intent of coming to India, to throttle an Indian company by not permitting it to sell its product in India."
Bolt Technology OU, formerly known as Taxify OU, is an Estonian Company which operates as a taxi aggregator. The court was told that it also provides ride-hailing, food and grocery delivery, rental of cars, e-bikes and scooters and EV (electric vehicle) charging stations/docks. 
In the suit filed before the High Court Bolt averred that Ujoy Technology by using the mark ‘Bolt’ in respect to EV charging stations in India, was passing off its products and services as those of Bolt’s.
Averring that the brand “BOLT” was conceived and adopted by it in 2018, the company pleaded that by continuous use, the mark ‘Bolt’ has amassed considerable goodwill and reputation and has become exclusively associated with its products and services.
Bolt argued that its ‘Bolt’ mark has amassed international reputation and goodwill, which has spilled over into India much before the adoption of the mark by the defendant. It further placed reliance on certain data sourced from the internet, which indicates the number of times Bolt’s App was accessed by drivers in Ahmedabad, Pune, Surat, Chennai and Kolkata.
Ujoy Technology contested Bolt’s claim that its ‘Bolt’ mark was entitled to be regarded as a “well known trade mark” under Section 2(1)(zg) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.
It contended that it is the largest player in India in the EV charging stations. It added that the EV charging stations/docks is not the business activity of Bolt and thus, Bolt does not enjoy any goodwill or reputation for the same.
It argued that use of the ‘Bolt’ mark by Bolt in relation to EV charging docks/ stations in Tallinn (Estonia), Lithuania and Portugal, can hardly be regarded as trans-border or worldwide reputation which can be said to have spilled over to India. 
The Court said Bolt admittedly has no trademark registration in India, though it has applied for registration of the trademark Bolt Charge and the Bolt device mark, which are pending with the Registrar of Trade Marks.
Observing that Bolt has no business, whatsoever, in India, the bench added that for establishing the tort of passing off, it has to be established that Bolt has a goodwill and reputation in India or that its goodwill and reputation, though garnered abroad, is so considerable that it has spilled over to India.
“In the present case, per contra, there is nothing, whatsoever, to indicate that the plaintiff was “in the EV-charging market” at all, even till date.” The “market”, in which Bolt was using the asserted ‘Bolt’ mark, was a market of taxi hailing services, with associated activities like food and grocery delivery and the like. In the EV-charging market, therefore, it becomes questionable whether the plaintiff can claim to be 'first'," said the court. 
It further took note that since Bolt has no commercial existence in India, even if persons in India were to download its App, no services of Bolt could be availed in India.
“The limited downloading of the plaintiff’s App by persons who may be travelling abroad to countries where the plaintiff’s services are available cannot, prima facie, be regarded as any sign of spillover of the plaintiff’s reputation into India, much less in the EV charging arena,” said the court.
The Court thus dismissed Bolt’s applications seeking interim injunction.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that in case of electricity consumption beyond the sanction load, the electricity consumer is liable to pay penalty in the form of demand surcharge.
It thus dismissed an appeal against trial court's judgement granting mandatory injunction and restricting the respondents from discontinuing the appellant's electricity connection, subject to payment of dues.
In this second appeal, the appellant sought refund of the amount paid.
The bench comprising Justice Alka Sarin observed, "Since the plaintiff-appellant was consuming electricity in excess of the sanctioned load there is no occasion for him being refunded any amount by way of issuing a mandatory injunction."
 After considering the rival submission of the parties, the court observed that as per the findings of the courts below, the plaintiff-appellant applied for an electricity connection of 95 KW load but vide an application he further requested for an electricity connection of 21 KW load. He also undertook to build-up the remaining load within next six months.
 Subsequently, even when he was not sanctioned increased load, the usage was in excess making him liable to pay the surcharge of Rs.750/- per KW as per the instructions of the defendant-respondent. 
 Court further added that no question substantial of law arises in the present case therefore, concurrent findings of fact recorded by the Courts warrants no interference by this Court.
 No question of law, much less, any substantial question of law arises in the present case. Both the Courts below have recorded concurrent findings of fact warranting no interference by this Court.
 In view of the above, the court finding no illegality and infirmity in the judgments and decrees passed by the Courts below dismissed the appeal accordingly.

While hearing a criminal appeal preferred by a priest accused of sexually assaulting a young girl, the Kerala High Court on Thursday voiced its concern over the pitiful fate of women abandoned by their husbands, particularly of the helpless children.
"When a man abandons his wife and children, roving vultures wait to prey on not only the abandoned woman, but also the helpless children. In this case we have a 'poojari'/'komaram' (priest/oracle in a temple) taking the abandoned woman and the three children under his wing, only to repeatedly molest the elder girl child, that too in the presence of her siblings. We wonder which God would accept the obeisance and offerings of such a priest or make him a medium?" 
The observations came in a matter where a temple pujari had taken an abandoned woman and her three children under his wing, only to repeatedly molest the elder girl child, that too in the presence of her siblings.
Background:
The incident came to light after the children were found wandering around the streets, shepherded by an almost insane mother. Child-line personnel immediately reported them to the nearest Vanitha Cell, and they were picked up at once.
 On enquiry, it was revealed that the woman showed signs of acute mental illness and displayed violent tendencies. Therefore, she was taken to a Mental Health Centre along with the youngest child.
This is when the child revealed that the appellant-accused had sexually molested her for one year. She was taken to the Police right away and a crime was registered against the appellant. 
In her statement, the victim spoke of the repeated acts committed on her in graphic detail- the instances of the accused knocking on the door, entering inside, stifling her with a cloth pushed into her mouth, tearing off her clothes and raping her while her two younger siblings cowered in fear at the corner of the room.
She also pointed out that although she complained of the same to her mother, she was asked to suffer, since the accused always came home drunk.
The school-going child also revealed that the accused had threatened to kill her if she divulged what she is subjected to. 
Her younger brother who was a witness to the crime spoke in tandem with the evidence provided by the prosecutrix.
Contentions Raised:
Advocate KM Firoz for the appellant took the Court through the charge to point out that there is a misjoinder of charges.
He argued that the POCSO Act was brought into effect from 14.11.2012 and that the incident on which the first charge is levelled was prior to the POCSO Act and therefore requires a committal proceeding under the Cr.P.C.
The appellant submitted that he was subjected to great prejudice due to the same. 
Further, the age of the victim was not proved by the prosecution under the POCSO Act.
Key Findings:
The Court found that the ground of absence of committal proceedings as against the offence alleged cannot be sustained. It observed,
"when the offences, which arise from the very same act, are tried together and the age of the victim is not proved, it is not as if the offence under the IPC charged against the accused would fall to the ground since no committal proceedings have been carried out under the Cr.P.C."
The Court added,
"When taking cognizance of a charge under the POCSO Act, the designated Special Court is empowered to try any offence, charged at the same trial. Otherwise, every trial under the POCSO Act will have to wait till the committal proceeding is over and that would defeat the very purpose of the enactment which envisages speedy disposal of the cases. It cannot also be the position that once the age is not proved, the offence under Section 376 would fail for reason of no committal proceedings having been taken under the Cr.P.C.
The POCSO Act enables such other offences to be tried without committal proceedings if it is to be tried in the same trial. The grounds of prejudice urged fails also for the reason that it is merely imaginary. We reject it at the outset on the above reasoning and also on the appellant having merely 'cried foul' without the particular prejudice caused or the specific failure of justice, having been stated or substantiated."
The bench also asserted that the charge was explicit and was of continued sexual assault of the penetrative kind on the victim by the accused, who was in the status of her guardian.
"Mere irregularity in charge does not prejudice the accused so long as he was aware of what was expected to be defended."
Additionally, the Court noted that the medical evidence clearly evidenced that the victim had been subjected to sexual acts. 
Moreover, it was found that the accused had made a total denial of even the joint residence with the mother and children under Section 313. However, the deposition of the house owners specifically established that fact.
"This deliberate falsehood stated by the accused under Section 313, points to his complicity and reveals the guilty mind. The accused said that he does not know the mother of the prosecutrix while there was overwhelming evidence as to the accused residing with the mother and children and his own child, as a family. "
The Court found this to be an additional circumstance against the accused. 
In its order, the Bench has also empathised with the mother of the victim. 
"The mental state of the mother, a shame on society, is quite understandable from the stress of having been abandoned, with three children and no means of food or shelter; for which alone the children were subjected to physical, mental and sexual torture. No mother can remain sane in the said circumstances."
Finally, the Court partly allowed the appeal by setting aside the appellant's conviction under the POCSO Act and Section 376(2) IPC, as the victim's age was not proved. 
However, since the offence of rape was proved, the accused was convicted under Section 376(1).
Considering the special relationship the accused had with the victim and the status of a guardian, the Court imposed on the appellant the maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
Case Title: Madhu v. State of Kerala & Ors.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently reiterated that merely because Section 37 of the NDPS Act comes into play where commercial quantity of contraband is involved, it does not mean that the accused cannot be entitled to bail whatever may be the circumstances that may be borne out from the record.
 Elaborating on the rigours prescribed under Section 37 NDPS Act, Justice Puneet Gupta observed that 'reasonable grounds' must be shown for believing that the accused is not guilty of offence under Section 19 or Section 24 or Section 27 and also for offences involving commercial quantity and is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.
"The mere severity of punishment under Section 8/22/29 NDPS Act should not weigh with the court if the circumstances placed on record do otherwise make out a case for bail in favour of the accused."
The bench was hearing a plea wherein the petitioner-accused sought bail in the complaint filed against him for offences under Section 8/22/29 NDPS Act.
 The counsel appearing for the petitioner argued that except for the so called statement of the petitioner and the other accused Muzaffar Ahmed from whom the drug has been allegedly recovered by the respondent, there is no other evidence which connects the accused with the commission of offence. It was asserted that the statement of the petitioner recorded in terms of Section 67 of the NDPS Act has no legal force, therefore the respondent could not bank upon the same against the petitioner.
 Agreeing with the submission, Justice Gupta referred to 'Toofan Singh vs. State of Tamil Nadu 2021 where the Supreme Court held that the statement recorded in terms of Section 67 of the NDPS Act cannot be used as a confessional statement in the trial of an offence under the Act as the officers who are vested with powers under Section 53 of the NDPS Act are police officers within the meaning of Section 25 of the Evidence Act.
 "In view of the said verdict the statements by the accused persons recorded in terms of Section 67 of the NDPS Act cannot be the mere reason for disallowing the bail unless other circumstances also call for rejection of bail", the bench underscored.
 Dealing with the contention of the respondents that call records of the mobile of both the accused confirm the fact that they were in constant touch with each other and deal in the sale and purchase of the contraband, the bench observed the call records of the mobiles will ultimately nail the petitioner-accused in the present case is a matter of trial and neet not be considered while hearing an application for bail.
 It placed firm reliance on State by (NCB) Bengaluru vs. Pallulabid Ahmed Arimutta and another 2022 wherein the Supreme court refused to dismiss a bail application on the basis of call records and held that the same can be examined at the stage of trial.
 Accordingly, the court allowed the application and the accused was granted bail subject to furnishing of two surety bonds and personal bond to the tune of Rs.1 lakh, each to the satisfaction of the trail court.

The Supreme Court has observed that in cases where the decree passed by the trial court merges with judgment and decree passed by the High Court, then the application for correction of decree can only be maintained before the High Court where the decree was confirmed.
The bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar was considering SLP assailing Karnataka High Court's order dated June 3, 2016.
The issue for consideration was whether an application for correction of the decree which has been confirmed by the High Court while deciding the appeal filed there against on merits can be corrected/altered by the Trial Court keeping in mind the purport of Section 153A of the Code of Civil Procedure.
While allowing the appeal in B. Boraiah Rep. Thr. Lrs. V. M.G. Thirthaprasad & Ors, the bench said, 
"In light of the operative order passed by the High Court while disposing of the appeal and cross objection, it leaves no manner of doubt that the decree passed by the Trial Court had merged with the judgment and decree passed by the High Court, referred to above. In such a case, the application for correction could be maintained only before the High Court where the decree has been finally confirmed in terms of decision dated 19.04.2012."
The Court further observed that application before the trial court for correction of such a decree can be maintained if the High Court was to decide an appeal under Rule 11 Order 41 of CPC.
"Whereas, an application before the Trial Court for correction of such a decree could be maintained only if the appeal was to be decided by the High Court under Rule 11, Order 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is not in dispute that the High Court had passed the stated judgment and decree after due consideration of all aspects on merits and not rejection of appeal under Rule 11, Order 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure."
The appeal before the High Court was filed in respect of 'A' schedule property, whereas cross objection was filed in respect of 'C' schedule property. The High Court had although referred to the appellant's contention of questioning the jurisdiction of the trial court for altering the decree which was affirmed by the High Court but referring to order dated March 14, 2014 related to dismissal of application for similar relief had dismissed the cross objection.
"In our opinion, the fact that the High Court vide order dated 14.03.2014 had rejected another application, does not address the legal issue about the jurisdiction of the Trial Court to alter the decree passed by the High Court. That question needs to be answered keeping in mind the final decree passed by the High Court albeit affirming the decree passed by the Trial Court," the Top Court said in regards to the High Court's dismissal of cross objections.
Granting the applicant the liberty to move a fresh application before the High Court in the first instance for the same relief, the bench further added that, 
"As a result, we hold that the Trial Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the application for correction of decree passed by the High Court in the first appeal and cross objection. On that count alone, the application filed before the Trial Court for correction of decree in respect of 'B' schedule property to be corrected as 'C' schedule property, is rejected as not maintainable before the Trial Court."

The Punjab And Haryana High Court last week granted protection to a Muslim Girl (16 Year Old) who married a Muslim boy (21 year old) while noting that she is of Marriageable Age under Muslim Personal Law.
Essentially, the Bench of Justice Jasjit Singh Bedi was hearing a protection plea filed by the couple (both Muslims) who solemnized their marriage as per Muslim rites and ceremonies.
The couple contended before the Court that in Muslim law, puberty and majority are one and the same and that there is a presumption that a person attains majority at the age of 15 years. 
It is further submitted that a Muslim boy or Muslim girl who has attained puberty is at liberty to marry anyone he or she likes and the guardian has no right to interfere. 
The counsel for the petitioners cited various rulings of the Punjab & Haryana High Court in this regard including the ruling in the case of Yunus Khan vs. State of Haryana & Ors.' [2014(3) RCR (Criminal) 518.
It was their further plea that their life and liberty is in grave danger at the hands of respondents Nos.5 to 7 and even though they moved a representation to the Senior Superintendent of Police, Pathankot, however, no action has been taken thereon. 
The counsel for the petitioners submitted that they would be satisfied at this stage if directions are issued for deciding the said representation in a time-bound manner in accordance with the law.
At the outset, the Court observed that in the case of Yunus Khan case, it was noted by the Court that the marriage of a Muslim girl is governed by the personal law of the Muslims.
"The law, as laid down in various judgments cited above, is clear that the marriage of a Muslim girl is governed by the Muslim Personal Law. As per Article 195 from the book 'Principles of Mohammedan Law by Sir Dinshah Fardunji Mulla', petitioner No.2 being over 16 years of age was competent to enter into a contract of marriage with a person of her choice. Petitioner No.1 is stated to be more than 21 years of age. Thus, both the petitioners are of marriageable age as envisaged by Muslim Personal Law.It may be noted that as per Article 195 from the book 'Principles of Mohammedan Law by Sir Dinshah Fardunji Mulla', Every Mahomedan of sound mind, who has attained puberty, may enter into a contract of marriage, and Puberty is presumed, in the absence of evidence, on completion of the age of fifteen years.
In this regard, the Court further noted,
"The Court cannot shut its eyes to the fact that the apprehension of the petitioners needs to be addressed. Merely because the petitioners have got married against the wishes of their family members, they cannot possibly be deprived of the fundamental rights as envisaged in the Constitution of India."
Thus, in view of the above discussion, the petition was disposed of with a direction to the respondent No.2- Senior Superintendent of Police, Pathankot, to decide the representation of the petitioners and take the necessary action as per law.
In India, the legal age of marriage is 18 years for girls and 21 years for boys. This is governed by the Special Marriage Act, of 1954, and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, of 2006.
However, under Muslim law, marriage or Nikah is a contract. The Muslim law recognizes- the right of adults to marry by their own free will. The conditions for a valid Muslim marriage are:
Both the individuals must profess Islam;Both should be of the age of puberty;There has to be an offer and acceptance and two witnesses must be present;Dower and Mehar; andAbsence of a prohibited degree of relationship.
It is equally important to note that in the Hadiya Case (Shafin Jahan v. Asokan K.M. and ors.), the Supreme Court had observed that the Legitimacy Of an adult woman's choice of marriage can't be questioned.
On December 15, 2021, the Union Cabinet cleared the proposal to raise the legal age of marriage for women from 18 to 21 years. This move would bring the legal age of marriage for women at par with men which is 21 years.
The Union Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani introduced in the Lok Sabha the "Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021", which seeks to increase the age of marriage for women to 21 years across all religions.

The Supreme Court has observed that an offender who had not used any deadly weapon at the time of committing robbery/dacoity cannot be convicted under Section 397 of the Indian Penal Code.
The use of deadly weapon by one offender at the time of committing robbery/dacoity cannot attract Section 397 IPC for the imposition of minimum punishment on another offender who has not used any deadly weapon,
In this case, the appellants -accused were convicted under Section 397 IPC which reads thus: If, at the time of committing robbery or dacoity, the offender uses any deadly weapon, or causes grievous hurt to any person, or attempts to cause death or grievous hurt to any person, the imprisonment with which such offender shall be punished shall not be less than seven years. Before the Apex Court, it was contended that the allegation of use of any weapon was against the other accused only and thus in absence of any allegations of use of any deadly weapon by the appellants, Section 397 IPC is not attracted.
To address this argument, the court first noticed Sections 391-398 and summarized the law regarding robbery and dacoity as follows:
As per Section 390 IPC, for 'robbery' there is either theft or extortion. When in the committing of the theft, or in committing the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, the offender, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or fear of instant death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint the theft can be said to be 'robbery'. In similar situation the 'extortion' can be said to have committed 'robbery'. As per explanation to Section 390 IPC the offender is said to be present if he is sufficiently near to put the other person in fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint.Section 391 IPC defines 'dacoity'. When five or more persons conjointly commit or attempt to commit a robbery, the accused then can be said to have committed the 'dacoity'. As per Section 392 IPC whoever commits robbery shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine. However, if the robbery is committed on the highway between sunset and sunrise, the imprisonment may be extended to fourteen years. As per Section 393 IPC even an attempt to commit robbery is punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years with fine. As per Section 394 IPC if any person, in committing or in attempting to commit robbery, voluntarily causes hurt, such person, and any other person jointly concerned in committing or attempting to commit such robbery, shall be punished with imprisonment for life or with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine. Section 395 IPC provides for punishment for 'dacoity'. Whoever commits dacoity shall be punished with imprisonment for life or with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine In case of dacoity with murder (Section 396 IPC) if any one of five or more persons, who are conjointly committing dacoity, commits murder in so committing dacoity, every one of those persons shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, or rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years with fine. As per Section 397 IPC if at the time of committing robbery or dacoity, the offender uses any deadly weapon, or causes grievous hurt to any person, or attempts to cause death or grievous hurt to any person, the imprisonment with which such offender shall be punished shall not be less than seven years. Similarly, if, at the time of committing robbery or dacoity the offender is armed with any deadly weapon, the imprisonment with which such offender shall be punished shall not be less than seven years
'Dacoity' an exaggerated version of robbery
Taking note of this , the bench observed that the 'dacoity' can be said to be an exaggerated version of robbery
On conjoint reading of the aforesaid provisions, commission of 'robbery' is sine qua non. The 'dacoity' can be said to be an exaggerated version of robbery. If five or more persons conjointly commit or attempt to commit robbery it can be said to be committing the 'dacoity'. Therefore, the only difference between the 'robbery' and the 'dacoity' would be the number of persons involved in conjointly committing or attempt to commit a 'robbery'. The punishment for 'dacoity' and 'robbery' would be the same except that in the case of 'dacoity' the punishment can be with imprisonment for life. However, in the case of 'dacoity with murder' the punishment can be with death also. However, in a case where the offender uses any deadly weapon or causes grievous hurt to any person, or attempts to cause death or grievous hurt to any person the imprisonment with which such offender shall be punished shall not be less than seven years.
The court thus agreed with the contention that to bring the case within Section 397 IPC, the offender who uses any deadly weapon, or causes grievous hurt to any person shall be liable for minimum punishment under Section 397 IPC.
Section 392 and Section 390 IPC are couched in different words. In Sections 390, 394, 397 and 398 IPC the word used is 'offender'. Therefore, for the purpose of Sections 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398 IPC only the offender/person who committed robbery and/or voluntarily causes hurt or attempt to commit such robbery and who uses any deadly weapon or causes grievous hurt to any person, or commits to cause death or grievous death any person  at the time of committing robbery or dacoity can be punished for the offences under Sections 390, 392, 393, 394, 395 and 397 and 398 IPC. For the aforesaid, the accused cannot be convicted on the basis of constructive liability and only the 'offender' who 'uses any deadly weapon….' can be punished. However, so far as Section 391 IPC 'dacoity' and Section 396 IPC – 'dacoity with murder' is concerned an accused can be convicted on the basis of constructive liability, however the only requirement would be the involvement of five or more persons conjointly committing or attempting to commit a robbery – dacoity/dacoity with murder (Para 12.4)
In the instant case, the court noted that there is no allegation against the appellant accused that they used dangerous weapons. The court referred to  Phool Kumar vs. Delhi Administration, (1975) 1 SCC 797 (para 5 & 6) and Dilawar Singh vs. State of Delhi, (2007) 12 SCC 641 (para 19 to 22) and observed:
Thus, as per the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid two decisions the term 'offender' under Section 397 IPC is confined to the 'offender' who uses any deadly weapon and use of deadly weapon by one offender at the time of committing robbery cannot attract Section 397 IPC for the imposition of minimum punishment on another offender who has not used any deadly weapon. Even there is distinction and difference between Section 397 and Section 398 IPC. The word used in Section 397 IPC is 'uses' any deadly weapon and the word used in Section 398 IPC is 'offender is armed with any deadly weapon'. Therefore, for the purpose of attracting Section 397 IPC the 'offender' who 'uses' any deadly weapon Section 397 IPC shall be attracted. (Para 12.7)
The other issue in this case was whether if the accused could not have been convicted for the offence under Section 397 IPC, still their conviction and sentence can be sustained under Section 391 IPC or not. The court noticed that in this case all the accused were charged by the trial Court for the offences under Section 395 IPC as well as 397 IPC. Therefore, once a case under Section 391 IPC punishable under Section 395 IPC is made out, they can be convicted for the offence under Section 391 IPC punishable under Section 395 IPC as no prejudice shall be caused to the accused, the court held. Regarding this, the court observed:
"Even otherwise there is no difference between Section 391/395 and Section 397 IPC so far as sentence/punishment except the difference in case of Section 397 IPC the punishment shall not be less than seven years. Otherwise, the 'robbery' and 'dacoity' are sine qua non. 'Dacoity' is nothing but an exaggerated version of 'robbery' with a difference in number of accused. Therefore, also even in a case where the accused is not convicted for the offence under Section 397 IPC, still he can be punished under Section 395 IPC and no prejudice shall be caused to him as ultimately the prosecution has to prove the 'robbery' and 'dacoity' either for the offence punishable under Section 395 IPC or under Section 397 IPC. However, to bring the case against the accused under Section 397 IPC, the prosecution has to prove one additional fact that the offender has used any deadly weapon or has caused grievous hurt to any person, or has attempted to cause death or grievous hurt to any person. Therefore, the case is made out under Section 391 IPC read with Section 395 IPC. Despite the fact that the courts below convicted the accused 36 under Section 397 IPC which is held to be unsustainable, in that case also if the case is made out under Section 391 IPC read with Section 395 IPC, still they can be convicted for the offence punishable under Section 391 read with Section 395 IPC even without even altering the charge."
In this case, in FIR there was a reference to five persons involved in committing the robbery. Even the charge-sheet was filed against five persons. However, as two accused absconded, the trial was split and three accused came to be tried. Thus one another contention raised by the accused was that no case is made out for the offence under Section 391 IPC and they cannot be punished under Section 395 IPC as what is required to be proved is involvement of five or more persons conjointly in committing the robbery and in the present case only four persons are tried and the prosecution has failed to prove the involvement of five or more persons. In this regard, the court said:
"Merely because some of the accused absconded and less than five persons came to be tried in the trial, it cannot be said that the offence under Section 391 IPC punishable under Section 395 IPC is not made out. What is required to be considered is the involvement and commission of the offence of robbery by five persons or more and not whether five or more persons were tried. Once it is found on evidence that five or more persons conjointly committed the offence of robbery or attempted to commit the robbery a case would fall under Section 391 IPC and would fall within the definition of 'dacoity'." 
The court also rejected the contention that, since in a subsequent trial one of the co- accused came to be acquitted and therefore the benefit of acquittal must be given to the present accused. In this regard, the court observed:
"At the outset, it is required to be noted that the accused are to be tried and convicted on the basis of evidence made in the trial in which they are convicted. It is also required to be noted that Benny came to be tried after a period of 15 years as his trial was split as he absconded. From the judgment and order of acquittal passed in the case of Benny, it appears that PW1 during the trial in case of Benny turned hostile. In the case of Benny only five witnesses came to be examined and for whatever reasons other witnesses have not been examined. In the present case PW1 not only supported the case of prosecution but as many as 15 witnesses came to be examined. Therefore, merely because in the subsequent split trial the Benny came to be acquitted the benefit of such acquittal cannot be in favour of the present appellants – accused as the prosecution has been successful in proving the case against the present accused"
Partly allowing the appeal, the bench set aside the conviction of the accused under Section 397 IPC and convicted them for the offences under Section 391 IPC punishable under Section 395 IPC and sentenced to undergo seven years Rigorous Imprisonment.

The Supreme Court held that a petition either under Section 7 or Section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is an independent proceeding which is unaffected by winding up proceedings that may be filed against the same company.
The bench comprising Justices RF Nariman and BR Gavai observed that a secured creditor stands outside the winding up and can realise its security de hors winding up proceedings.
In this appeal, the appellant's contention was that post admission of a winding up petition, no petition under Section 7 of the IBC can be filed. According to it, the effect of Section 446 of the Companies Act, 1956 (which is equivalent to Section 279 of the Companies Act, 2013) is that no suit or other legal proceeding can be initiated once there is admission of a winding up petition.
Referring to provisions of the IBC, the bench observed IBC will prevail over the other statutes. It said:
Given the object of the IBC as delineated in paragraphs 25 to 28 of Swiss Ribbons (P) Ltd. v. Union of India, (2019) 4 SCC 17 ["Swiss Ribbons"], it is clear that the IBC is a special statute dealing with revival of companies that are in the red, winding up only being resorted to in case all attempts of revival fail. Vis-à-vis the Companies Act, which is a general statute dealing with companies, including companies that are in the red, the IBC is not only a special statute which must prevail in the event of conflict, but has a non-obstante clause contained in Section 238, which makes it even clearer that in case of conflict, the provisions of the IBC will prevail.
The court said that it is not possible to accede to the argument that given Section 446 of the Companies Act, 1956 / Section 279 of the Companies Act, 2013, once a winding up petition is admitted, the winding up petition should trump any subsequent attempt at revival of the company through a Section 7 or Section 9 petition filed under the IBC. It said:
A conspectus of the aforesaid authorities would show that a petition either under Section 7 or Section 9 of the IBC is an independent proceeding which is unaffected by winding up proceedings that may be filed qua the same company. Given the object sought to be achieved by the IBC, it is clear that only where a company in winding up is near corporate death that no transfer of the winding up proceeding would then take place to the NCLT to be tried as a proceeding under the IBC. Short of an irresistible conclusion that corporate death is inevitable, every effort should be made to resuscitate the corporate debtor in the larger public interest, which includes not only the workmen of the corporate debtor, but also its creditors and the goods it produces in the larger interest of the economy of the country. It is, thus,
Also, referring to Section 230(1) of the Companies Act, 2013, the bench said 
What is clear by this Section is that a compromise or arrangement can also be entered into in an IBC proceeding if liquidation is ordered. However, what is of importance is that under the Companies Act, it is only winding up that can be ordered, whereas under the IBC, the primary emphasis is on revival of the corporate debtor through infusion of a new management.
Another contention raised was that the SREI has suppressed the winding up proceeding in its application under Section 7 of the IBC before the NCLT and has resorted to Section 7 only as a subterfuge to avoid moving a transfer application before the High Court in 28 the pending winding up proceeding.
"These arguments do not avail the Appellant for the simple reason that Section 7 is an independent proceeding, as has been held in catena of judgments of this Court, which has to be tried on its own merits. Any "suppression" of the winding up proceeding would, therefore, not be of any effect in deciding a Section 7 petition on the basis of the provisions contained in the IBC. Equally, it cannot be said that any subterfuge has been availed of for the same reason that Section 7 is an independent proceeding that stands by itself. As has been correctly pointed out by Shri Sinha, a discretionary jurisdiction under the fifth proviso to Section 434(1)(c) of the Companies Act, 2013 cannot prevail over the undoubted jurisdiction of the NCLT under the IBC once the parameters of Section 7 and other provisions of the IBC have been met.", the bench said while dismissing the appeal.
Read Judgment

The Kerala High Court recently directed the State Government to complete the process of constituting the Metropolitan Planning Committee (MPC) for Kochi as mandated under Article 243ZE of the Constitution without further delay. 
A division bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Murali Purushothaman while considering a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by natives of Kochi City, recorded the submission of the Additional Chief Secretary that the setting up of the Metropolitan Planning Committee was already in motion. The court also directed the State to take immediate steps to form the Kochi Metropolitan Development Authority, to ensure proper urban planning for the Kochi Metropolitan area: 
“Having given due consideration to the material on record, in particular, the averments that steps have been taken to constitute a Metropolitan Planning Committee for the Metropolitan area of Kochi, as mandated under Article 243ZE, taking note of the length of time, i.e. nearly 2 decades, we direct the Chief Secretary, Secretariat, Thiruvananthapuram, the Additional Chief Secretary to the Government, Local Self Government Department, Thiruvananthapuram, and the Principal Director, Local Self Government Department, respondents 1, 3 and 4 respectively, to finalize the preparation of the process already undertaken and as explained in the foregoing paragraphs of the counter affidavit filed by the 3rd respondent, and constitute the Metropolitan Planning Committee for Kochi, as mandated under Article 243 ZE, and also to take immediate steps for the formation of Kochi Metropolitan Development Authority, for the purpose of implementing, coordinating and supervising the orderly development of Kochi Metropolitan area, within four months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.” 
The PIL was filed by two natives of Kochi, aggrieved by the failure of the state government to give effect to Article 243 ZE to the Constitution introduced through the 74th Constitutional amendment despite the lapse of more than 30 years. Article 243 ZE mandates the constitution of a Metropolitan Planning Committee (MPC), for preparing a draft development plan for metropolitan areas in India that have a population of more than 10 lakhs. 
The plea sought a direction to the state to establish a MPC to ensure that the urban planning of Kochi takes place in an orderly fashion. The petitioners also sought for the establishment of a statutory body called Kochi Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA), ‘for implementing, coordinating, and supervising the orderly development of Kochi region within the Kochi Metropolitan area’ to fulfil the constitutional mandate under Article 243 ZE. 
Adv K. R. Deepa appeared for the State, Adv. Jaishankar V. Nair, appeared for the Centre and Advocate Sunil Jacob Jose and Advocate Ajit M.S appeared for the petitioners. 
The court took on record, the submissions made by the Additional Chief Secretary in the counter affidavit filed. The state in its affidavit stated that: 
“The government is seized of the rapid urbanising nature in and around Kochi as well as other areas, and also of the fact that urban growth necessitates a new approach to the development on account of multiple peculiarities of urbanising populations-the issues arising out of enhanced population density, the pressure on utilities, the load on public infrastructure, the need for climate resilience and adaptability, the need to accommodate transitory population and intensive migration etc. based on which it has been decided to come out with a detailed urban policy.” 
In this regard, the state submitted that an expert committee was being constituted for providing inputs for formulating an urban policy. 
The state also informed the court that currently, the responsibility of preparing development plans is with the District Planning Committee (DPC) which was also set up under the constitutional mandate under Article 243 ZD. 
“The role and functions of the DPC have been developed and finetuned over 26 years of decentralised governance in Kerala. The DPCs have also prepared District Plans as per Government directions through a detailed process of consultation and feedback. The Ernakulam District Plan was finalized and published in 2018 and is available on the website of the State Planning Board.”, it was stated in the Additional Chief Secretary’s affidavit.
The state also submitted that the responsibility envisaged for the Metropolitan Planning Committee (MPC) as per the constitution is already being undertaken by the District Planning Committee for the entire district of Ernakulam including the metropolitan area of Kochi. It was further submitted by the State that a comprehensive plan needed to be worked out such that the DPC and MPC can function complementary to each other with no overlap. The state requested some time from the court to put into place a comprehensive urban policy and to perform its constitutional obligation regarding the Metropolitan Planning Committee.
However, the court noting the inordinate delay that had already occurred in the implementation of the plan, gave the State 4 months’ time to comply with its order and made it clear that no application for extension of time would be entertained in the matter. 
Case Title: Adv. Richard Rajesh Kumar V State of Kerala 

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently reiterated that before deciding to drop proceedings in a criminal complaint, the Court has to be satisfied that the subject matter involved in the complaint is a purely civil wrong and that it has no criminal texture to it.
The observations were made by Justice Sanjay Dhar while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had challenged order of Municipal Magistrate, Jammu dismissing his criminal complaint in exercise of powers under Section 203 CrPC and the order of Additional Sessions Judge, Jammu which dismissed the revision petition filed against Magistrate's dismissal order.
The petitioner contended that the contents of the complaint clearly disclose commission of criminal offence against the respondents, inasmuch as the offence of criminal breach of trust and forgery are disclosed against them. It was further argued that provision of alternative mechanism for redressal of any dispute does not ipso-facto absolve a person from criminal liability and that mere presence of civil element in a criminal offence does not mean that no offence is made out.
 The criminal complaint was filed after a building agreement went sour. The complaint filed for offences under Sections 406/ 409/ 481/ 420/ 467/ 468/ 120-B RPC alleged that the Petitioner was to be awarded certain tenancy rights, however, the respondents dishonestly shifted the tenancy rights without the knowledge of the complainant.
 The Courts below held that the dispute is in the realm of civil dispute for which remedy is available in the agreement executed between the parties and as such, criminal proceedings cannot lie against the respondents.
 Deciding the matter in controversy, Justice Dhar observed that there can be no dispute to the fact that merely because a particular act of a person gives rise to civil liability against another person does not mean that no criminal proceedings can be initiated against such person.
 In order to explain the law on the subject the bench placed firm reliance on the Supreme Court judgement in M/s Indian Oil Corporation v. M/s NEPC India Ltd. and others (2006) 6 SCC 736 wherein SC observed,
 "A given set of facts may make out: (a) purely a civil wrong; or (b) purely a criminal offence; or (c) a civil wrong as also a criminal offence. A commercial transaction or a contractual dispute, apart from furnishing a cause of action for seeking remedy in civil law, may also involve a criminal offence. As the nature and scope of a civil proceedings are different from a criminal proceeding, the mere fact that the complaint relates to a commercial transaction or breach of contract, for which a civil remedy is available or has been availed, is not by itself a ground to quash the criminal proceedings. The test is whether the allegations in the complaint disclose a criminal offence or not."
 Applying the position of law in vogue on the matter, the bench went on to analyse the offences alleged in the complaint and held that it is clear that the transaction between the petitioner and respondent No.1 is purely of civil nature and it has been given a criminal colour by the petitioner/complainant, which is impermissible in law and hence the trial Magistrate was justified in dismissing the complaint by exercising his powers under Section 203 CrPC.
 Accordingly, the bench dismissed the petition.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that directions to take voice sample of accused does not infringe his/her rights under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India. 
The bench comprising Justice Avneesh Jhingan dismissed the petition, challenging the Lower Court's order which directed the Petitioner-accused to give his voice sample. It observed that the infringement of the fundamental right to privacy cannot be raised to create a bubble to scuttle the investigation.
 The infringement of the Fundamental Right to Privacy cannot be raised to create a bubble to scuttle the investigation nullifying the evidence collected by merely denying that the voice in recording is not of the petitioner and there being no comparison.
The case came up as a result of the order delivered by the learned Additional Sessions Judge directing the petitioner to give a voice sample. An FIR was registered against the petitioner under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 for taking illegal gratification. The telephone conversation of accused was taken into possession by the police.
Thereafter, the prosecution filed an application for taking a voice sample, opposing which the petitioner argued that the impugned order is in violation of Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India, and it also infringes his right to privacy.
 While dealing with this contention, the court held that this issue raised by the petitioner is no longer res Integra. While placing reliance on the case of Ritesh Sinha v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 2019 (8) SCC 1, the court held that the directions to take voice samples do not infringe Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India.
 Coming on to the issue of taking a voice sample as being against the right to privacy of the petitioner, the court relied on the case of Justice K.S.Puttaswamy (Retd.), and Anr vs. Union of India and Ors; 2017 (10) SCC 1, in which it was held that the right to privacy is not absolute though it is protected as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
 While defining a voice sample, the court held that a voice sample in a sense resembles fingerprints and handwriting that are used for comparing the evidence already collected.
 Voice samples in a sense resemble fingerprints and handwriting, each person has a distinctive voice with characteristic features dictated by vocal cavities and articulates. The samples are collected after having permission in accordance with the law. The sample taken itself would not be an evidence, rather they are for comparing the evidence already collected.
 Court further held that the infringement of the Fundamental Right to Privacy cannot be raised to create a bubble to scuttle the investigation. With the advancement of technology, the modes of communication are also changing, and to keep pace with the change there is a need for a new technology that can collect and compare the evidence.
 With the advancement of technology, the modes of communication are changing. To keep pace with the change, new technology is required to be used for collecting and comparing evidence. One method being tapping of communication devices but after compliance of the procedure laid down. It is in that context that taking of voice samples are necessitated. The samples collected are not evidence in itself, rather are tools for comparison the voice recording.
 In the instant case, the court delved into the question of the power of the judicial magistrate to order a person to give his sample and provided that until a specific provision is inserted in the Cr.P.C. for taking voice samples, a Judicial Magistrate must be conceded the power to order to give a sample.
 In the light of the above discussions, we unhesitatingly take the view that until explicit provisions are engrafted in the Code of Criminal Procedure by Parliament, a Judicial Magistrate must be conceded the power to order a person to give a sample of his voice for the purpose of investigation of a crime. Such power has to be conferred on a Magistrate by a process of judicial interpretation and in the exercise of jurisdiction vested in this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India.
 Accordingly, the court dismissed the petition.
Case Title : Ravi Parkash Sharma v State of Punjab

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has observed that merely because the parties are engaged and are meeting each other, it doesn't give any right or liberty to the proposed bridegroom to sexually exploit the fiancée without her consent.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has observed that merely because the parties are engaged and are meeting each other, it doesn't give any right or liberty to the proposed bridegroom to sexually exploit the fiancée without her consent. 
"The petitioner cannot get any leverage to physically exploit the fiancée against the consent during the period intervening the engagement and the marriage," the Bench of Justice Vivek Puri observed as it denied anticipatory bail to a man who has been implicated in a rape case by his fiancée.
The case in brief
The Roka Ceremony of Petitioner (Prospective Bridegroom) and his fiancée (Victim) was held on January 30, 2022, and the date of marriage was fixed for December 6, 2022, with the consent of the family. On June 18, 2022, the prosecutrix was taken to a room in a hotel wherein despite her reluctance, the petitioner entered into a physical relationship with the prosecutrix and also made her videos.
Subsequently, on July 17, 2022, the mother of the petitioner (Prospective Bridegroom) informed the mother-in-law of the sister of the prosecutrix that the petitioner is quarreling for the last two months at home as he does not want to solemnize marriage with the prosecutrix.
It was the case of the petitioner that when his family came to know that the prosecutrix was having love affairs with other male friends, they decided to call off the marriage on July 2, 2022.
However, her fiancée (Victim) lodged a case under Section 376 IPC against the petitioner alleging that he raped her on June 18, 2022.
The petitioner's counsel argued that subsequent to the engagement, the petitioner and the prosecutrix had voluntarily visited the hotel and their names have been reflected as guests in the records of the hotel. 
It was further contended that the physical relations were developed with the consent of the prosecutrix. Even subsequent to the occurrence, the WhatsApp messages were exchanged which indicate that it was a consensual relationship and therefore, no case under 376 IPC is made out.
Court' observations 
At the outset, the Court observed that the WhatsApp messages sought to be relied upon by the petitioner were subsequent to the occurrence and that there was a lack of material to indicate that as on June 18, 2022 (the date of alleged occurrence), the prosecutrix had consented to any such relationship.
"The WhatsApp chat at a subsequent stage may have been exchanged on the score that the matrimonial alliance was existing at that point of time. However, it does not indicate that the act was committed by the petitioner with the consent of the prosecutrix. It is not borne out that at any point of time, the prosecutrix has voluntarily consented for the sexual intercourse and it is a case of a consensual relationship," the Court further remarked.
Against this backdrop, the Court also took into account the fact that as per information derived from the mother of the petitioner, there was reluctance on the part of the petitioner to solemnize marriage even at the point of time when a physical relationship was developed. 
"There is a lack of material to indicate that there was genuine intention on the part of the petitioner to solemnize marriage and the prosecutrix was the consenting party at the relevant time. In the peculiar circumstances of the case, it is not made out that it was a case of a consensual relationship...there is a categoric statement of the prosecutrix that the petitioner entered into physical relationship with her, despite her reluctance, refusal, and denial. The passive submission on the part of the prosecutrix to the act, cannot be construed as a circumstance to hold that it was a case of consensual relationship" the Court remarked as it dismissed the anticipatory bail plea.
Case title - Sagar Kapoor v. State of Haryana [CRM-M-35393-2022 (O&M)]

The Bombay High Court on Friday dismissed Shiv Sena MLA Latabai Sonawane's plea challenging a decision of the Scheduled Tribe (ST) Certificate Committee that had dismissed her claim of belonging to the Tokre Koli, an ST community.
 A division bench of Justices Ramesh D Dhanuka and Sanjay G Mehare observed that "the petitioner's father's caste in his birth register is shown as "Koli". It was a pre-Independence entry. The revenue record in the name of her grandfather shows his caste as "Hindu". "Hindu" is not a caste. Her sisters' caste in the school leaving certificates is also not shown as "Tokre Koli". The petitioner has no case that she, her sisters, father or grandfather has ever attempted to correct in their school record."
 The petitioner was elected as a corporator for Jalgaon Municipal Corporation on ST reserved seat and her caste certificate was forwarded to the Committee for validation. In the interim, she contested in the 2019 Legislative Assembly election from the Chopda constituency and was elected. She then resigned from the corporator post. However, her caste claim, registered after her proposal for validation after her election as Corporator, was pending.
The committee sought a vigilance report and called Sonawane to submit her explanation to the said report. Instead of replying, she insisted on deciding on her application for withdrawal of the proposal. Since she did not file her reply, the scrutiny committee invalidated her claim on November 4, 2020.
 The petitioner approached the High Court challenging the committee's decision, which ordered her to resubmit a caste certificate granted by a competent authority within seven days and ordered the validation process to be completed within four months. She then proceeded to challenge the High Court order before the Supreme Court, which dismissed her special leave petition on December 7, 2021, and directed the committee to decide on the proceedings within four months from the date of order. Meanwhile, the High Court also dismissed her plea seeking transfer of validation proceedings before the Nandurbar Committee.
Moreover, former MLA Jagdishchandra Ramesh Valvi filed an objection before the scrutiny committee over her stated caste. The committee, in February 2022, held that there were entries contrary to pre-Independence entries that showed her blood relatives belonging to the Tokre Koli caste and invalidated the caste certificate issued to her.The bench held that Sonawane "failed to prove" that she belongs to Tokre Koli tribe caste and impugned judgment by the committee is "well-reasoned order". 
"The entries of the pre-independence era, if rebutted, cannot be given probative value. The presumption under section 90 of the Indian Evidence Act would also not help the petitioner for the reason that the strong evidence in rebuttal was available," it observed.
Thus, the Court refused to interfere in the matter and dismissed the petition.
Case Title: Latabai v. State of Maharashtra & Ors.

The Bombay High Court has reiterated that the power of the Court under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act) to grant interim measures of protection, is wider than the power under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC). It ruled that procedural provisions enumerated in the CPC cannot be invoked to defeat the grant of interim relief, while deciding an application under Section 9 of the A&C Act.
 The bench of Justice Bharati Dangre concluded that the Court is empowered to pass an order under Section 9 of A&C Act granting the applicant's money claim, on the basis of an admitted claim or acknowledged liability. It noted that the Court, while considering a relief under Section 9, is not strictly bound by the provisions of Order 38 Rule 5 of CPC.
 The respondent- Naseem Qureshi, engaged the services of the petitioner firm- JP Parekh & Son, as an Architect, for the redevelopment of his property. Subsequently, Letters of Appointment were issued in favour of the petitioner.
 After the respondents failed to clear the bills raised by the petitioner and terminated its services by appointing a new Architect, the petitioner filed an application under Section 9 of the A&C Act before the Bombay High Court, seeking a direction to the respondents to pay the fees payable under the Letters of Appointment.
 The petitioner- JP Parekh & Sons, while relying upon the arbitration clause contained in the Letter of Appointment, submitted before the High Court that the respondents had breached the terms and conditions of the Agreement. It added that the respondents terminated the appointment of the petitioner as an Architect, to evade their obligation to pay the petitioner's professional fees.
 Referring to Section 9(1)(ii)(b) of the A&C Act, the petitioner contended that interim measures can also be issued by the Court for the specific purpose of securing the amount in dispute.
 Thus, the petitioner averred that since the amount due and payable under the bills issued by it, was admitted by the respondent, there were good chances of succeeding in the arbitral proceedings. Therefore, it argued that the same justified the grant of interim measures pending the arbitration proceedings, even if no case was strictly made within the purview of Order 38, Rule 1 and 2 of the CPC.
 The respondent Naseem Quresh contended that the contract between the parties was in the nature of a service contract and the claim raised by the petitioner in the Section 9 application was in the form of a monetary claim. It added that since the contract between the parties was determinable, the Court cannot grant specific performance.
 The High Court ruled that the power to grant interim measures under Section 9 of the A&C Act must be guided by the underlying principles which govern the exercise of analogous power under the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The Court added that exercise of power under Section 9 cannot be carried out in an uncharted territory, ignoring the basic principles of procedural law contained in the CPC. However, it ruled that procedural provisions enumerated in the CPC cannot be invoked to defeat the grant of interim relief, while deciding an application under Section 9 of the A&C Act.
 Further, the bench held that the Court, while exercising its power to issue interim measures, must ascertain the manifest intention of the applicant to take recourse to the arbitral proceedings at the time of filing the Section 9 application. It added that the said intention can be gathered from the surrounding circumstances, including from the issuance of notice under A&C Act, so as to establish the applicant's manifest intention to refer the dispute to arbitration.
 The High Court added that the power conferred upon the Court under Section 9 is not unbridled and that it is subject to certain restrictions; firstly, it can be exercised by the Court to the same extent and manner as it could be exercised in relation to any proceedings before it. Secondly, such exercise of power to make interim arrangements should not militate against any power which might be vested in the arbitral tribunal.
 The bench referred to the decision of the Bombay High Court in Jagdish Ahuja & Anr. versus Cupino Ltd. (2020), where the High Court had ruled that the Court, while considering a relief under Section 9 of the A&C Act, is not strictly bound by the provisions of Order 38, Rule 5 of CPC.
 Further, the Court noted that the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Valentine Maritime Ltd. versus Kreuz Subsea Pte Limited & Anr. (2021) has held that the arbitral tribunal is empowered to make an interim Award granting money claim on the basis of the admitted claim and/ or acknowledged liability of the opposite party.
 Noting that the power of the Court under Section 9 of the A&C Act is wider than the power under the provisions of CPC, the bench observed that the provisions of Section 9 and 17 of the A&C Act are meant for protecting the subject matter of the dispute, till the arbitral proceedings culminate into an Award. Further, it added that the Court is also entitled to consider whether denial of such order would result in great prejudice to the parties seeking such protective order.
 The Court referred to the averments made by the petitioner in the Section 9 application, where it pleaded that the respondents, by their own admission, were dissipating their assets, which may render an Award in favour of the petitioner a paper Award. Further, the petitioner contended that the bills raised by it under the Letter of Appointment, regarding its professional fees and other charges, were admitted by the respondents.
 Observing that the respondents had failed to specifically deny the claims raised by the petitioner, regarding the amounts due to it under the agreement, the bench ruled that the apprehension expressed by the petitioner was sufficient to secure its claim by invoking Order 38 Rule 5 of CPC.
 The respondent Naseem Quresh submitted before the High Court that the party invoking section 9 need not have actually commenced the arbitral proceedings, however, it must be able to satisfy the Court that the arbitral proceedings were actually contemplated and were positively going to be commenced within a reasonable time.
 The respondent argued that despite a lapse of one year from the issue of termination notice and the filing of the Section 9 application, no arbitral proceedings had been instituted by the petitioner. Thus, it argued that there was no material to indicate that the arbitral proceedings were actually contemplated or manifestly intended and therefore, the relief under Section 9 could not be granted.
 Dismissing the contentions of the respondent, the Court ruled that in view of Section 9 (2) of the A&C Act, as inserted by the 2015 Amendment Act, there is a statutory provision which itself contemplates the commencement of arbitral proceedings within a period of 90 days from the date of an order granting interim measures, or within such time as the Court may determine.
  While holding that the power under Section 9 of the A&C Act is totally independent of the principles governing grant of injunction under CPC, the Court directed the respondents to deposit the amount claimed by the petitioner. 
 "Thus, from the pleadings in the Petition, which are not traversed, it is evident that there is practically no defence to the paybility of the amount and since Respondent Nos.1 and 2 have already appointed new Developer through whom work is likely to be carried out, and on being satisfied that the prima-facie case exist in favour of the Petitioners and balance of convenience also lies in their favour and irreparable loss would be caused to them if the amount is not secured by directing it to be deposited towards the fees due and payable in terms of the Letter of Appointment, in absence of any denial that the amount is not payable, I deem it appropriate to grant relief, pending the commencement of the arbitration proceedings to be initiated within the period of 90 days from today."

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has recently observed that any higher qualification than the one prescribed for a particular post may not be a suitable qualification and that the employer, in its wisdom, is justified in excluding candidates with higher qualification from the ambit of selection.
Importantly, the Bench of Justice Sanjay Dhar and Justice Ali Mohammad Magrey observed that the laying down of the criteria of the minimum and the maximum qualification for the Class-IV post as matric and 10+2, respectively, is neither irrational, unreasonable nor arbitrary
The case before the court
Essentially, the Court was dealing with a letter patent appeal filed by the appellant calling into question the Single Judge order wherein he had held that the candidates with higher qualification are not eligible to apply when the advertisement notice prescribes minimum and maximum qualification.
With this, the Writ Court had declared that the appellant was overqualified for the post of an Attendant (Class- IV) [in Jammu and Kashmir Public Service] and, therefore, could not apply for the post in question.
Challenging the same, he moved before the Dvision Bench.
Court's order
At the otuset, the Court noted that the appointment to Class-IV posts in Jammu and Kashmir Public Service has to be in accordance with the Jammu and Kashmir Appointment to Class-IV (Special Recruitment) Rules, 2020.
The Court also noted that a government notification which is issued for the purposes of recruitment of Class-IV posts, the minimum and maximum qualification shall be matric and 10+2, respectively, even the advertisement notification in question also specifically provides for the same qualification.
Importantly, regarding the employer's discretion to lay down the qualification to a particular post, the Court noted that the suitability and the qualifications for any post have to be laid down by the employer and the same are not liable to be interfered with judicially, until and unless the policy decision in that regard is found to be irrational or arbitrary.
Against this backdrop, referring to the case of appointments to Class-IV posts, the Court observed thus:
"...higher qualification than the prescribed 10+2 may not be suitable for many reasons; the first being that a highly qualified person may not be in a position to discharge the menial work which is required to be done by a Class-IV employee; secondly, if such highly qualified candidates are allowed to compete with candidates with lower qualification, as prescribed, it is but obvious that they will score above them and would get selected to the detriment of the candidates possessing the requisite eligibility; and thirdly, such candidates of higher qualification, if selected, would always be looking for a better job and, as soon as they are selected in some other better discipline, they would leave the Class-IV post rendering the entire selection as useless, besides forcing the employer to get those posts re-advertised and re-filled." 
The Court also referred to the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Chief Manager, Punjab National Bank & Another v. Anit Kumar Das, Civil Appeal No.3602 of 2020, wherein, it was observed that the qualification of 12th pass for the post of Peons in the Bank is justified as it is a conscious decision taken by the Bank and no candidate with superior qualification can be recognized as eligible for the post.
Lastly, dismissing the appeal, the Court added thus:
"What we mean to express is that higher qualification may not be suitable qualification for every post and, if candidates with higher qualifications are excluded, the view of the learned Single Judge in this regard cannot be faulted with and said to be illegal or perverse."
Case title - Firdous Ahmad Ganai v. State of JK & Ors
Read Order/Judgment

The Karnataka High Court recently upheld a family court order which directed the mother of a seven years old girl child to hand over the custody to child's father, after observing that she herself was more attentive towards her illicit relationship at work rather than welfare of her child.
A division bench of Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice S Vishwajith Shetty dismissed the appeal filed by the woman and observed,
"If the issue regarding the relationship of the appellant with the said S (name redacted) juxtaposition the welfare of the child is considered, it appears that the appellant has given more importance to the illicit relationship of hers with the said S (name redacted) and has neglected the child...she had handed over custody of the child to her parents who were residing at Panchakul in Chandigarh while she continued to stay at Bengaluru with S (name redacted)."
It added,
"the Courts are not only required to consider the comforts and attachments of the child but should also take into consideration the surroundings in which the child is growing, the moral and ethical values which the child learns by observation, availability of care and affection when the child needs it most and thereafter strike a balance which would be more beneficial for the child's welfare and interest."
The family court had allowed a petition filed by the child's father under Section 25 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 Act.
 In appeal, the mother argued that she and the child were "thrown out" of the matrimonial home but the child is now growing in a good atmosphere and pursuing her studies. Moreover, she argued that there is nobody to take care of the girl child in the house of the respondent whereas she herself is a doctor having good income and she is capable of taking care of the child.
The respondent-father on the other hand contended that the appellant developed an illicit relationship at work in 2016, a year after the child's birth. She used to be away with her parmour during weekends while he and his parents with the help of a housemaid took care of the child. Thereafter, she left the matrimonial house along with the child in 2018. He claimed that the child was growing in a "unholy atmosphere" in the midst of an illicit relationship between the appellant and her paramour, apprehending that the welfare of the child and its future was not safe.
At the outset, the High Court observed that the respondent-father successfully proved that the relationship of the appellant with S (name redacted) was beyond business meetings. “If the meetings were in relation to any business transaction, they were required to be held in the coffee shop or in the lobby of the hotel or in a meeting room. However, Ex.P-15 document clearly shows that the appellant and the said S (name redacted) had checked into the hotel room and they had stayed in the room on certain occasions even overnight.”
 It expressed that though in normal circumstances, the wish/desire of the child would also play a prominent role while deciding the custody of the said child. However, having regard to the material on record and the fact that the child was throughout kept away from the father and was being tutored by the appellant mother, Court said no purpose would be served by ascertaining from the child its desire or wish.
 “Desire and wish of a child can be ascertained only if the child is mature enough to form an intelligent preference and judgment, otherwise, it is for the court to analyse the material and make a decision taking into consideration the paramount interest of the child,” it added.
 The Court continued,
“When the child is deprived of a proper parenthood, its overall growth and happiness gets effected and in such situation, the Courts are not only required to consider the comforts and attachments of the child but should also take into consideration the surroundings in which the child is growing, the moral and ethical values which the child learns by observation, availability of care and affection when the child needs it most and thereafter strike a balance which would be more beneficial for the child's welfare and interest.”
 Further noting that the appellant had filed cases against the husband after leaving his house, the bench said, “All these aspects would clearly go to show the attitude and hostility of the appellant towards the respondent, in spite of she continuing her illicit relationship with the aforesaid S (name redacted) after leaving the matrimonial house.”
 Further the bench said the woman had not honoured several orders of the court providing visitation rights to the respondent and she had successfully kept the child away from the respondent.
 The court also junked the contention of the woman that since respondent has not produced the necessary certificate under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the photographs of the appellant in the company of her paramour relied on by him cannot be accepted as evidence.
 It said “In view of Section 14 of the Family Courts Act, 1984, the Family Court is authorised or empowered to receive as evidence any report, statement, documents, information if any, in its opinion, the same would assist it to deal effectually with a dispute, irrespective of whether it is relevant or admissible under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.”
 Further noting that the woman had after leaving the matrimonial house handed over the custody of the child to her parents in Chandigarh the bench said “Therefore, it is very clear that prior to the appellant leaving her matrimonial house as well as after she left the matrimonial house, she had not taken care of the child and it was the respondent and his parents who were taking care of the child while she was staying from the matrimonial home.”
 Accordingly, the Court upheld the family court order. It also granted visitation rights to the mother and said, “We feel that the interest of the minor child will be best served if the custody of the child is handed over to the respondent, but with sufficient access to the appellant to visit the minor at frequent intervals.” Thus it laid down certain situational criteria for the couple to follow.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently made certain important observations as to the non-applicability of promissory estoppel against government on grant of NOC with respect to land use, vis-a-vis a subsequent acquisition for "public purpose" under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
A Division bench of Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli observed,
"Once permission is granted/NOC is granted for setting up of college and thereafter, State cannot acquire it for all time to come, this may lead to an anomalous situation which may not be in the larger public interest and would amount to "public interest" making way for "private interest" which is not permissible at any costs/under any circumstances...doctrine of "legitimate expectation" or the principle of "promissory estoppel" can't be pressed into service where the public interest is likely to suffer as against the personal interest of a party."
The brief facts of the case are: Petitioners were granted permission to set up a school and the NOC was issued to set up the B.Ed. College by the State Government on a certain piece of land. The state government later acquired the same piece for development of Industrial Model township to be developed as an Integrated complex for industrial, residential, recreational and other public utilities. The petitioners challenged this acquisition by the state government under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The High Court while hearing the case decided as follows:
 Grant of NOC/ licence/ CLU does not give the landowner right to set up a plea of "promissory estoppel" against the State
 The petitioners contended that state government is barred by the rule of "promissory estoppel" from acquiring the land for which it had issued NOC to them. The bench while rejecting this contention of petitioners observed: "The factum of grant of NOC for establishing the college would not be an impediment for the State Government to acquire the land in accordance with the provisions of the applicable land acquisition act."
 The bench held that the grant of NOC/ license/ CLU or any other permission would not give the landowner a right to set up a plea of "promissory estoppel" against the State.
 Use of land for development of industrial infrastructure constitutes "public purpose" under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894
 The Land Acquisition Act, 1894 gives power to the state government to acquire land required for "public purposes", upon satisfaction of certain procedural requirements. The petitioners in the present case contended that the development of Industrial Model township i.e. the purpose for which land was acquired, is not a public purpose. Rejecting this contention of the petitioners, the bench observed that the definition of public purpose is not capable of being given a static and definite definition and that the state is the first judge to decide the "public purpose" for which the land is required to be used, though such decision is subject to judicial scrutiny. 
 It held that the land in question is required for development of industrial infrastructure which constitutes "public purpose". The bench also observed that since long time has lapsed from the date of acquisition, even if due to change in the planning, if the land in question is sought to be utilised for any other public purpose, there would no impediment for same in view of the settled proposition of law.
 The recommendations of the Land Acquisition Collector are not binding on the State 
 Section 5A of the Act, provides hearing of the objections to the proposed acquisition of land by the Collector. The petitioners contended that recommendations made by the Land Acquisition Collector to exempt land from the acquisition proceedings in the objections heard in present case are binding on the State Government. The court rejected this contention of the petitioners and observed: "Recommendations made by the Land Acquisition Collector to exempt land from the acquisition proceedings or even to acquire the land are not binding on the State except that same have to be considered by the State Government while forming the opinion."
 No case of discrimination under Article 14, Constitution of India made out
 The bench also rejected the contention of the petitioners that the action of the state government violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India and observed that petitioners have to show that they are identically situated to such persons in whose favour discrimination is being pleaded to prove discrimination on part of the state. Court rejected the argument stating that petitioners have not placed on any material to support its contention of discrimination. 
 The court also laid emphasis on the fact that when on 26.02.2007, it made an order in favour of the petitioners, granting them interim stay on dispossession [status quo order], the petitioners did not bring to the notice of the court the fact that the land had already vested in the state government by the announcement of the award under section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The court relied on Indore Development Authority v. Union of India, wherein the Apex Court has held that once the possession of the land is taken by the State, person retaining the possession is merely a "trespasser". The court held that the land stood vested when interim stay was granted, and that the petitioners deserves to be non-suited on the ground that the land stands vested in the State.

The Delhi High Court has directed a Sadar Bazar trader to pay rupees five lakhs to Louis Vuitton within four weeks or face civil prison for a week, after he was held guilty of contempt for violating a restraining order by continuing to sell counterfeit products of famous French luxury brand. 
Justice C Hari Shankar observed that a counterfeiter abandons any right to equitable consideration by a court functioning within the confines of the rule of law, adding that he is “entitled to no sympathy” as he “practices, knowingly and with complete impunity, falsehood and deception.”
“Counterfeiting is an extremely serious matter, the ramifications of which extend far beyond the confines of the small shop of the petty counterfeiter. It is a commercial evil, which erodes brand value, amounts to duplicity with the trusting consumer, and, in the long run, has serious repercussions on the fabric of the national economy,” the court said. 
It added that even while remaining within the confines of Order XXXIX Rule 2A of CPC (consequence of disobedience or breach of injunction), the court is required to be “economically and socially sensitized” and to send a deterrent message to others who indulge or propose to indulge in the practice of counterfeiting.
On September 23 in 2021, the court, while hearing a suit filed by Louis Vuitton Malletier, had restrained several small entities from "importing, manufacturing, selling or offering for sale or otherwise dealing with the registered trademarks "Louis Vuitton Malletier" or the logo "LV", as well as other associated monograms and patterns, as would infringe the registered trademarks of the plaintiff.
An application was later moved by Louis Vuitton alleging violation of the restraining order by the trader, one of the defendants in the suit. It was submitted that the trader continued to sell belts bearing the LV brand at least till September last year. 
Justice Shankar said that the trader chose to continue with his business of selling counterfeited LV branded goods, even after having been injuncted from doing so. 
Observing that apologies and entreaties to the court can hardly mitigate the misdemeanor, the court ordered:
“I am of the opinion that the interests of justice would best be subserved if, in the present case, the defendant is directed to pay, to the plaintiff, ₹ 5 lakhs within a period of four weeks from today, failing which Mr. Javed Ansari, the proprietor of Defendant 2, shall suffer incarceration in civil prison in Tihar Jail for a period of one week.”
The court also said that if the injunction is only with respect to one brand, it cannot, while proceeding under Order XXXIX Rule 2A of CPC, take into account other brands which may also have been counterfeited. 
Noting that in the injunction granted vide its September 2021 order was with respect to manufacture and marketing of goods bearing the LV brand, the court observed:
“There is no injunction regarding manufacture and marketing of any other brand. The manufacture or marketing of any other brand by the defendant cannot, therefore, statutorily constitute a relevant consideration under Order XXXIX Rule 2A, as the provision is clearly restricted to the injunction granted, and nothing more.”
The court said that Order XXXIX Rule 2A court cannot rewrite the order of which breach is alleged as that would lie completely outside the province of its jurisdiction.
“Even if it were to be presumed that the defendant was counterfeiting other brands, to punish the defendant therefor under Order XXXIX Rule 2A, would require the court to rewrite the order dated 29th September 2021 passed under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 as injuncting the defendant not only from manufacturing goods bearing the LV brand, but also from manufacturing goods bearing other brands,” the court added.

The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday (17th March) ordered the release of a Nepali man who was arrested about 41 years ago and since then he had been under detention.
 The bench of Chief Justice Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan and Justice Aniruddha Roy ordered thus after noting that current mental age in terms of intellectual functioning of the Man is around 9 years and 9 months.
 The bench was hearing the case of one Dipak Joshi, who was arrested on 12th May 1980 and has already undergone a period of more than 40 years in custody.
 Nepali Man In Custody For 40 Years: Calcutta High Court To Examine If The Prosecution Be Terminated In Suo Moto Proceedings
 On the basis of the materials on record, the Court observed that after the assessment of his mental status (sometime in January 1982) when he was found to be not mentally fit to stand trial, there had been no contrary report at any point of time even as of now before the Court of Session where the case is pending trial.
 Thus, in the exercise of authority under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. and Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, the Court ordered his release after noting,
 "In the aforesaid view of the matter, we do not see that any useful purpose will subserve the ends of justice by continuing to detain UTP Dipak Joshi @ Jaisi @ Jaishi in the Correctional Home."
 The Court ordered that the Man (housed in Dum Dum Correctional Home) in connection with Sessions Case No.31 of 1981 in the First Additional District & Sessions Judges, Darjeeling is released from the Correctional Home and entrusted to the custody of Prakash Chandra Sharma Timsina.
 "It is impossible and impermissible to direct the UTP to execute any bond in view of the deficit in his mental capacity. Ends of justice will be satisfied if his release is supported by a simple bond executed by the aforementioned, Prakash Chandra Sharma Timsina in favour of the Registrar General of this Court undertaking to produce the UTP as and when directed by this Court", the Court added.
 Lastly, the Court directed all Statutory Authorities to facilitate the transit of UTP Dipak Joshi @ Jaisi @ Jaishi to Nepal under the aegis of the Consulate General of Nepal in India at Kolkata upon his release.

The Gujarat High Court has dismissed the petition filed by an employee seeking that his period of suspension be treated as 'regular' on the ground that the Petitioner had been charge-sheeted and was only partially exonerated from the charges against him. Justice Biren Vaishnav observed:
 "Only when an employee is partially exonerated, would the authority need to decide the question of whether the suspension can be treated to be wholly unjustified and whether he should therefore be given such proportion of pay and allowance as the competent authority would prescribe by a specific order...Here is a case where on a charge-sheet being issued, the order of penalty was passed. Obviously therefore not exonerating the petitioner from the charge. It was therefore, within the right of the employer to treat the period of suspension as such reinstating the petitioner in service with a condition that orders of regularization of suspension is kept in abeyance."
The High Court also ventured forth to observe that the Petitioner had filed the Second Appeal 15 years after the order of rejection of the First Appeal and therefore, the petition ought not be entertained.
 The Petitioner herein was working with the Respondents as a driver. Subsequently, a charge-sheet was issued against him in 2003 and resultantly, he was suspended from service. A departmental inquiry of 2003 also held the Petitioner guilty of charge. A show cause notice was issued to the Petitioner in 2004 asking why a penalty of stoppage of three increments should not be imposed for misconduct. The Petitioner responded to the notice and subsequently, a penalty of stoppage of two increments was imposed. The Petitioner's First Appeal in 2005 was rejected. However, in the interregnum, the authority revoked the order of suspension and reinstated the Petitioner in 2003. 
The Petitioner filed the Second Appeal against the order of the First Appeal in 2018, seeking regularization of period of suspension and consequential pay and allowances, which was rejected.
 The Petitioner primarily contested that he was reinstated in 2003 and therefore, the employer ought to pass an order regularising the period of suspension and consequential pay and allowances that could have an effect on his terminal benefits. Reliance was placed on Chimanlal Virjibhai Bhalani v. Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Limited and other cases to insist on regularisation. 
 The Respondent-Company averred that the order of penalty was passed in 2004 while the Second Appeal was filed after 15 years and therefore, the petition ought not be entertained. Attention was drawn to the aspect of delay by placing reliance on C. Jacob v. Director of Geology and Mining 2008(10) SCC 115. It was also argued that Regulation 241 of the Service Regulations provided that the benefits of full pay and allowances would only be provided if the employee was fully exonerated. 
 Two issues were identified by Justice Vaishnav for consideration- first, whether the order rejecting the impugned order of 2018 was just and proper and second, whether the instant application could be considered on the ground of delay.
 To the first question, Justice Vaishnav confirmed that a penalty of stoppage of two increments was passed and yet, the Petitioner did not challenge the order until after 13 years. Therefore, basis the C Jacob judgement, such an application ought to be rejected. Otherwise too, the Bench concluded that basis Regulation 241, the question of treating the period of suspension and awarding the benefits of full pay and allowance can only be considered if an employee is fully exonerated.
The Bench held,
 "Here is a case where the petitioner was imposed a penalty which was commensurate with the conduct on the charge being proved and the suspension therefore could not have been treated as wholly unjustified when read in light of the Regulation 241."
The Court further held that Chimanlal (supra) would not be of any assistance to the petitioner inasmuch as it was a case where an order of dismissal was set aside by the employer on it being harsh. The penalty was modified by the Appellate Authority. It was in these circumstances, that a direction was issued to the authorities to consider the case of the petitioner in light of the regulation. No positive finding with regard to the period being treated as regular was a question that was decided.
 Accordingly, the application was dismissed.

In a first, the Punjab and Haryana High Court, while dealing with a bail plea, sought the response of the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT to get a broader outlook of the bail jurisprudence across the world.
To assess the worldwide view on bail when the assault is laced with cruelty, the bench of Justice Anoop Chitkara used the AI tool and put the following question to it:
"What is the jurisprudence on bail when the assailants assaulted with cruelty?"
ChatGPT came up with the following response:
"The jurisprudence on bail for cases where the assailants have assaulted with cruelty will depend on the specific circumstances of the case and the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction where the case is being tried. However, in general, if the assailants have been charged with a violent crime that involves cruelty, such as murder, aggravated assault, or torture, they may be considered a danger to the community and a flight risk. In such cases, the judge may be less inclined to grant bail or may set the bail amount very high to ensure that the defendant appears in court and does not pose a risk to public safety. The severity of the assault, the defendant's criminal history, and the strength of the evidence against them are all factors that a judge will consider when deciding whether to grant bail. It is important to note that the presumption of innocence is a fundamental principle of the justice system, and all defendants are entitled to bail unless there are compelling reasons to deny it. Therefore, even in cases where the assailants have assaulted with cruelty, they may still be granted bail if the judge determines that they do not pose a risk to the community or a flight risk."
However, the Court clarified that any reference to ChatGPT was neither an expression of opinion on the merits of the case nor shall the trial Court advert to these comments and that the it was only intended to present a broader picture of bail jurisprudence, where cruelty is a factor.
Essentially, the bench had the ocassion to refer to the AI chatbot while dealing with the bail plea of one Jaswinder Singh @ Jassi who has been accused of brutally assaulting the deceased along with his accomplices leading to his death.
In its order, the Court noted that the complainant and the deceased, who were unarmed were waylaid by the petitioner and his other accomplices and attacked in an abhorrent manner as substantiated by the nature of injuries on their bodies.
The Court observed that causing death itself is cruel but if the cruelty causes death, the tables turn. It also opined that when the physical assault is done with an element of cruelty, the parameters of bail also change.
Stressing that when the offense is heinous and the crime is brutal, cruelty becomes one of the factors in granting or refusing bail, the Court noted thus:
"The impact of individuals who act with cruelty is devastating not only for those on whom the direct harm and pain is inflicted but also on a systemic level. Cruel individuals contribute to sustain the greater deficiencies of society like gender, economic and social inequalities. Once the courts form a prima facie opinion that the accused acted with cruelty, then such an accused ordinarily should not be granted bail, and if the courts still deem it appropriate to grant, then it must be after specifying the reasons for such an indulgence."
Further, the Court took note of the fact that the bail applicant had a criminal history of two cases and there was nothing on record which could assure the Court that if the accused is released on bail, then he shall not indulge in criminal behavior and will not abscond.
Against this backdrop, the Court concluded that an analysis of the allegations, injuries, and evidence collected points out that the accused and some of his accomplices acted with ferociousness and total lack of mercy which does not warrant the grant of bail to the accused.
Case title - Jaswinder Singh @ Jassi vs. State of Punjab and another

While allowing a criminal revision petition and granting statutory bail to a petitioner in a NDPS case, the Madras High Court observed that even if the investigating agency has filed an application seeking an extension of time for completing the investigation, the public prosecutor has to file a separate report, showing that he had applied his mind and was satisfied with the investigation.
 Even if the application is routed through the Public Prosecutor that will not be sufficient, he is expected to apply his mind independently, while seeking extension of time by the investigating agency Justice G Ilangovan observed.
 In the present case, pending investigation, the Superintendent of Customs (complainant) had filed an application seeking extension of time for completing the investigation. The petitioner had also preferred an application seeking statutory bail. The trial court, observing that the application for extension was filed before the expiry of 180 days and being satisfied with the grounds mentioned in the petition, granted the extension of time and rejected the claim of the statutory bail of the petitioner.
 The petitioner submitted that the petition was not filed by the Special Public Prosecutor but by the Investigation Officer and only a counter-signature was obtained from the Special Public Prosecutor. The petitioner submitted that the same did not fulfill the requirements of law under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. 
 The petitioner relied on the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Jigar @ Jimmy Pravinchandra Adatiya Vs State of Gujarat wherein the court highlighted the importance of informing the accused about the application seeking an extension of time as the same would otherwise violate his fundamental right under Article 21 of the constitution.
 The petitioner also relied on the decision of the Apex Court in Sanjay Kumar Kedia @ Sanjay Kedia Vs Intelligence Officer in which the court had discussed extensively the importance of application by the Public Prosecutor. The court had held as under:
 The use of the expression "on the report of the public prosecutor indicating the progress of the investigation and the specific reasons for the detention of the accused beyond the said period" as occurring in clause (bb) in sub- section (2) of Section 167 as amended by Section 20(4) are important and indicative of the legislative intent not to keep an accused in custody unreasonably and to grant extension only on the report of the public prosecutor.
 Thus, as per the Apex court, the report of the Public Prosecutor was not a mere formality but a very vital report as its acceptance would affect the liberty of the accused. Further, the request of an investigating officer for an extension of time was not a substitute for the report of the public prosecutor. 
 Though the respondent authorities claimed that the request of the investigating agency was routed through the Public Prosecutor after his independent application of mind which was sufficient to fulfill the requirements of the law, the court did not agree with this contention.
 Thus, the court found that the extension of the time limit granted by the trial court was not legally sustainable and set aside the same, in effect granting bail to the petitioner.

The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday observed that there is existing social stigma associated with the offence of rape and accordingly held that a delay in lodging FIR in cases of such nature would not vitiate the prosecution case.  The Court accordingly upheld the conviction of a man for raping a minor victim aged 14 years who had subsequently given birth to a still born child. 
A Bench comprising Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Bivas Pattnayak observed that it is apparent that the victim did not inform anyone about the crime due to continuous threats by the appellant and that she had proceeded to lodge the police complaint only after her pregnancy was discovered. 
"I am also not unmindful of social stigma attached to the nature of the offence which might have also attributed to the delay in lodging FIR. Even otherwise, the mere factum of delay in filing complaint in regard to an offence of this nature by itself would not be fatal so as to vitiate the prosecution case", the Court underscored. 
Further the Court observed that there is no evidence of concoction of a false version or embellishment and accordingly dismissed contentions pertaining to the delay lodging of an FIR. 
Background 
In the instant case, the appellant had challenged the order of conviction issued by the Sessions Court under Section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act) and under Sections 448 (house trespass) and 506 (criminal intimidation) and 376 (2)(i) (rape on a woman when she is under 16 years of age) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC). 
The appellant used to come to the house of the victim for the last 7 years and would even refer to the victim as his 'grand-daughter'. Taking advantage of the absence of other family members, the appellant had trespassed into the house of the victim and had forcibly committed rape on her repeatedly on different occasions for the last 6-7 months. Thereafter, the minor victim had herself lodged a compliant against the appellant on June 10, 2014. 
Due to the offence of rape, the minor victim had subsequently conceived and given birth to a still born child on August 29, 2014. 
Observations 
Although the Court acknowledged that there has been delay in lodging the FIR, it rejected the contention of the appellant that the case of the prosecution is shrouded with suspicion as there is immense delay in lodging of the FIR. 
The Court observed that the victim in the written complaint as well as in her statement under section 164 CrPC has consistently stated of continuous threatening by the appellant. 
"The evidence of the victim girl and other evidence as discussed above unerringly point to the guilty of the appellant as the person who ravished the victim on several occasions by entering into their house during the absence of other family members resulting in her pregnancy and also of threatening the victim with consequences to kill her and her family members in order to coerce her from disclosing such fact to her family members", the Court held. 
Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court judgment in State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh and Others wherein the Apex Court had observed, "The courts cannot overlook the fact that in sexual offences delay in lodging FIR can be due to variety of reasons particularly the reluctance of the prosecutrix or her family members to go to the police and complain about the incident which concerns the reputation of the prosecutrix and the honour of her family. It is only after giving cool thought that a complaint of sexual offence is generally lodged."
The Court further noted that only after a Councillor from Childline spoke to the minor victim did she agree to lodge a complaint. "Therefore it is quite apparent from the above evidence that the victim did not inform about the incident due to continuous threatening by the appellant and only when her pregnancy was discovered, she lodged the complaint", the Court observed further. 
 It was further noted that although no DNA test had been done on the delivered child due to a lapse on the part of the investigating officer, however, this could not be a ground to discredit the testimony of the victim girl. "The victim girl had no control over the investigating agency and any negligence of the investigating officer cannot affect the credibility of the evidence of the victim girl", the Court underscored further. 
Accordingly, the Court upheld the conviction of the appellant and further held that the minor victim is entitled to compensation under the 'Victim Compensation Scheme'. 
Case Title: Md. Israil v. The State of West Bengal

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court observed that Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh are bound to adhere to the standards prescribed by the regulatory authority, National Medical Council such as infrastructural facilities, faculty etc. while setting up government medical colleges in the respective states. A Bench of Justices BR Gavai and CT Ravikumar made this observation while hearing a set of writ petitions challenging the decision of the Medical Council of India (now NMC) refusing to issue Letters of Permission to eight colleges, possessing a total of 800 seats, in the three states. In its order, the court added that the Centre as well as the NMC have ample powers to take steps, if there are deficiencies within the medical colleges. “The respondent states are bound to adhere to the standards prescribed by the regulatory authority, NMC. If there are any deficiencies, NMC and Centre have ample powers to take such steps as are permissible in law.”
In June, 2018, the Court was informed by the three states, via affidavits that various steps were being taken to remove the deficiencies pointed out by the NMC. Based on that assurance, the court had granted permission to start the MBBS course in these medical colleges from the academic year 2018-2019 onwards. The Court had also directed the NMC to carry out inspections to check whether states have removed those deficiencies or not. In that hearing, the Bench had come down heavily on the three states for the poor infrastructure of their government medical colleges. These questions were posed to NMC during the hearing today. “You are satisfied that there are no deficiencies now?”, the Bench asked the Advocate Gaurav Sharma, appearing for the NMC. The advocate appearing for the Bihar said, 
“We had filed an affidavit on how deficiencies have been removed. We are adhering to the timelines given (in the 2018 affidavit). There are no complaints now.”
The Bench was prompted to close the matter after observing that NMC, after carrying out periodic inspections, noted that the deficiencies which were pointed out in the medical colleges have been rectified by the respective states. “Advocate Gaurav Sharma for MCI (now NMC) states that periodical inspections are being carried out with regard to the aforesaid medical colleges established by the three states. In that view of the matter, no purpose is served by keeping the matter pending.”
With this, the Court added the all those students who were admitted during the 2018-2019 academic year should be treated as regular students.

The Allahabad High Court recently decided to consider a bunch of questions framed by it on issues related to religious educational institutions like Madrasa vis-a-vis the role of and interplay between the State Government and such institutions within the framework of the Constitution. The Bench of Justice Ajay Bhanot was hearing the plea of a Madrasa duly recognized by the Madrasa Board and aided by the State Government seeking the creation of additional posts of teachers in view of an increasing number of students. The petitioner also challenged the Uttar Pradesh Government's decision to reject the representation/application for the creation of additional posts. Against this backdrop, the Court before proceeding with the matter, asked the State Government to bring in the record the syllabi/courses, conditions, and standards of recognition including the requirement for playgrounds at the Madrasas and all other religious institutions which are recognized or aided by the State Government. The Court further asked the State Government to disclose as to whether Madrasas so recognized and aided also admit girl students. Prima facie, the Court has formed the following questions for consideration based on the submissions made by the Advocates:
Whether the policy of the State Government to provide financial aid to educational institutions which impart religious education is consistent with the scheme of the Constitution, particularly, in light of the word "Secular" in the Preamble to the Constitution of India? Whether Government sfunding of institutions run by religious minorities which impart religious education faithfully implements the constitutional protection afforded to all religious faiths especially religious minorities in the country, especially with reference to provisions of the Constitution from Articles 25 to 30 of the Constitution of India? Whether the institutions which impart knowledge in diverse fields and also include courses in theological learning come within the ambit of the phrase "religious instruction or religious worship" or only schools which exclusively impart religious education come within the ambit of Article 28 of the Constitution of India? Whether the absence of a mandatory provision for playgrounds for recognition even for Madrasas and other religious institutions is incompatible with the rights of children conferred by Article 21 read with Article 21A of the Constitution of India? Whether other religious minorities are also provided government aid for running theological schools?

The Andhra Pradesh High Court recently ruled that the bail granted cannot be cancelled under Section 439(2) of Code of Criminal Procedure if there are vague allegations against the accused without any substantive proof.
 Brief facts of the Case
 The criminal petition was filed under Section 439(2), CrPC to cancel the bail that was granted to the accused. It is a case of double murder.
 The wife of one of the deceased filed the petition for cancellation of the said bail that was granted to the accused in the above crime on the ground that there were no changes of circumstances for grant of bail after the dismissal of two earlier bail applications. Furthermore, she alleged that the accused through their men have been threatening the witnesses and interfering with the process of investigation and making an attempt to tamper with the prosecution evidence.
 The Additional Public Prosecutor for the State submitted that a condition was imposed that the accused would not enter the village and the accused had been complying with the said condition. He also submitted that the entire investigation was completed and about 48 witnesses had been examined and only forensic science report is awaited to file the charge sheet.
 Court's Ruling 
 The court in the present matter observed that in the third bail application which was allowed, the Additional Sessions Judge had noted that some police personnel was deployed in the village as there was threat to the family members of the accused and he further held that since material witnesses were examined, there would be no chance to the accused to interfere with the investigation. On the basis of the stage of investigation, the bail was granted to the accused.
 Justice Cheekati Manavendranath Roy relied on Raghubir Singh v. State of Bihar, 1986 where the illustrative instances of when bail can be cancelled were given:
 (i) the accused misuses his liberty by indulging in similar criminal activity, (ii) interferes with the course of investigation, (iii) attempts to tamper with evidence or witnesses, (iv) threatens witnesses or indulges in similar activities which would hamper smooth investigation, (v) there is likelihood of his fleeing to another country, (vi) attempts to make himself scarce by going underground or becoming unavailable to the investigating agency and (vii) attempts to place himself beyond the reach of his surety, etc....".
 Furthermore, in Myakala Dharmarajam and others v. State of Telangana, 2020, the alleged complaint that accused were influencing witnesses was held to be vague as except making an omnibus allegation to that effect there was no material to substantiate the same and the bail granted was not cancelled.
 The court held that the accused making an attempt to threaten the witnesses appeared to be vague allegation without any valid basis. Nothing was brought to the notice of the police or investigating agency that the accused interfered with the course of investigation. The criminal petition was hence dismissed.
 Case Title: Vaddu Lakshmidevamma @ Lakshmi Devi v. the State of Andhra Pradesh

The Karnataka High Court has said that the Appellate Court should be very cautious and exercise the discretion judiciously while remanding the matter for a de-novo trial.
 A single judge bench of Justice Dr HB Prabhakara Sastry, set aside the order dated September 2, 2013 passed by the appellate court which had in turn set aside the conviction handed down by the trial court under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI) against the accused and remanded the matter to the trial Court ordering for a de-novo trial.
 The bench said, 
"When the evidence of the parties, in the chief examination, cross examination and re-examination (if any) were recorded in verbatim and was faithfully placed on record then for merely not recording the order observing that the matter would be tried as a summons case or as a regular trial would not itself vitiate the trial conducted by the Magistrate of the Trial Court, when it has not resulted in miscarriage of justice."
 The bench noted that as per Section 143 of the N.I. Act, the nature of the proceedings for the trial for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act is summary in nature. However, the very same Section also enables the Magistrate when it appears to him that the nature of the case is such that, a sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding one year may have to be passed or that it is, for any other reason, undesirable to try the case summarily, after hearing the parties, to record an order to that effect and thereafter recall any witness who may have been examined and proceed to hear or re-hear the case in the manner provided by the Criminal Procedure Code. Thus, it enables the Magistrate to try the case as a summons case.
 Further the bench said the accused in the Trial Court itself, had taken a contention that a de novo trial is required to be conducted by the Magistrate. However, the Magistrate of the Trial Court in her impugned judgment has made a detailed discussion on the contention taken up by the accused and has made a specific observation that the predecessor Magistrate had recorded the entire memorandum of evidence of witnesses and not the substance of evidence as required under the summary trial.
 Noting that the predecessor Magistrate had not recorded only the substance of evidence. The predecessor Magistrate might have decided to try the case as a warrant case, the bench observed, 
"Therefore, the Magistrate of the Trial Court adopted the procedure which has to be adopted in a warrant trial while recording his evidence. She recorded the memorandum of evidence given by the witness in full and given sufficient opportunity to the opponent party to cross-examine the witness fully and thoroughly and has recorded the evidence in its entirety as given by the parties."
 It added,
 "However, the Sessions Judge's Court only on the point that the Magistrate, before proceeding to record the evidence as in summons case or a warrant case, had not recorded her reason in writing, had set aside the impugned judgment passed by the Trial Court and remanded the matter to the Trial Court for a de novo trial."
 Finally the court held, "The Sessions Judge's Court ought to have decided the appeal before it on its merit, as such, the revision under consideration deserves to be allowed and the matter requires to be remanded to the Sessions Judge's Court for its fresh disposal, in accordance with law."

"Evidence of a public officer cannot be thrown only on the ground that he is a police officer," the Allahabad High Court has held recently while denying bail to an accused allegedly involved in a case pertaining to recover of 1,025 kg ganja.
Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav discarded the argument that the arresting officials did not comply with the mandatory provisions of search and seizure under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. 
The applicant had argued that no public witness was taken by the police in the alleged recovery proceedings despite the alleged recovery was made on the Highway.
However, the Court noted,
"The recovery was made at night and due to pandemic prevalent at that time and seclusion no public witness could be secured. Apart from this, the law is well settled that the evidence of a public officer cannot be thrown only on the ground that he is a police officer."
In the instant case, during patrolling, a huge amount of Ganja weighing 1025 kg was recovered from a dumper truck which was driven by co-accused Vinod Singh and the applicant was sitting on the truck. Accordingly, the applicant and the co-accused were booked under Section 8/20/29 of the NDPS Act.
The Applicant moved an application under Section 439 CrPC seeking enlargement on bail.
The counsel for the applicant contended that the applicant was merely a passenger in the vehicle and had no knowledge about recovered contraband nor any contraband was recovered from his possession. The counsel also submitted that, during arrest, mandatory provisions of Sections 42, 50, 52, 53, 57 of NDPS Act were not complied and hence the applicant must be enlarged on bail.
The counsel for the State submitted that the applicant was involved in the inter-state trafficking which was voluntary admitted in a statement made by the applicant under Section 67 of the NDPS Act. The counsel also stated that compliance of Section 50 of NDPS Act was made as the accused were searched in the presence of a gazetted officer. Further the counsel stated that, since the recovery made in the instant matter is more than the commercial quantity, it amounts to the attraction of section 37 of NDPS Act, hence the bail application is liable to be rejected.
Findings 
The court relied on the Supreme Court's judgement in Union of India Vs Md. Nawaz Khan where the court held that absence of possession of contraband by the accused cannot be the sole ground for grant of bail.
"Based on the above precedent, the test which the High Court and this Court are required to apply while granting bail is whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the accused has not committed an offence and whether he is likely to commit any offence while on bail. Given the seriousness of offences punishable under the NDPS Act and in order to curb the menace of drug-trafficking in the country, stringent parameters for the grant of bail under the NDPS Act have been prescribed," it was held therein.
On absence of recovery of the contraband from the possession of the respondent 
The court referred to the judgement of Union Of India vs Rattan Mallik and stated that – "the absence of possession of the contraband on the person of the accused does not absolve him of the level of scrutiny required under Section 37 (1)(b)(ii) of the NDPS Act."
On entitlement of Bail – 
The court relied on the judgement given by the Apex Court namely State vs. Syed Amir Hasnain, (2002) 10 SCC 88 where it was held that an accused would not be entitled to be released under the provisions of the NDPS Act unless the provisions of Section 37 of the Act are satisfied. 
On no public witness was taken by the police in the alleged recovery proceedings, the court stated that – 
"it is evident that the recovery was made at night and due to pandemic prevalent at that time and seclusion no public witness could be secured. Apart from this, the law is well settled that the evidence of a public officer cannot be thrown only on the ground that he is a police officer." 
 Accordingly, the bail application was rejected.
"from the perusal of the evidences, collected during investigation so far, prima facie, the involvement of the accused in the present case cannot be ruled out. No reason is found to falsely implicate the applicant/accused. Therefore, there is no good ground to release the applicant­-accused on bail at this stage."

The Orissa High Court directed the Commissioner GST to issue clear instructions to all the officers in the GST Commission rates in the state not to issue any notice demanding payment of service tax/GST to practising lawyers.
"It appears that despite knowing fully well that advocates are not liable to pay service tax or GST, notices continue to be issued to them by the GST Commissionerate. The Court expresses its concern that practising advocates should not have to face harassment on account of the Department issuing notices calling upon them to pay service tax/GST when they are exempted from doing so, and in the process also having to prove they are practising advocates." the bench comprising the Chief Justice S. Muralidhar and Justice B.P. Routray observed.
The court was considering a writ petition filed by one lawyer Devi Prasad Tripathy challenging a notice issued to him. The bench perused the counter affidavit filed by Principal Commissioner GST in which it was stated that "after receiving information from Devi Prasad Tripathy having PAN as being an individual advocate practicing in the Hon'ble High Court of Odisha", further proceedings against him are dropped."
"What the Court is concerned about is the deponent insisting that the Petitioner should have submitted "documentary evidence to prove his claim that he is a practicing individual lawyer and does not come under the provision of GST or service tax.", the bench observed. The court also heard other advocates present in the Court who stated that they too have received such notices. 
Directing the Commissioner to issue instructions in this regard, the bench said that the copies of such instructions shall be placed before it.
The case will be taken up on 22nd April.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that a child in conflict with the law as per the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act) can not file an application under Section 438 of CrPC seeking anticipatory bail.
"In case, the provisions of Section 438 Cr.P.C. are allowed to hold the field in the matters of juvenile, the aim and object of the Act shall be defeated. The interpretation of law cannot be devised in a way, so as to put a hurdle in the broader and solemn aim which is sought to be achieved by this enactment," the Court said.
With this, the bench of Justice Jyotsna Sharma disagreed with the Bombay High Court's last year ruling in the case of Raman & Manthan v. The State of Maharashtra  (Bom) 253 and instead found weightage in the ruling of the Allahabad High Court in the case of Shahaab Ali and Another vs. the State of U.P.; 2020 (2) ADJ 130
"I am of the firm view that the Juvenile Justice Act is a comprehensive legislation containing all provisions with regard to children in conflict with law and that the provisions of Section 438 Cr.P.C. have no application being extraneous and incompatible with the scheme, as well as aim and objective, sought to be achieved by the Act," the Court aid as it dismissed an anticipatory bail plea moved under section 438 CrPC by the father of a minor (child in conflict with the law) facing FIR under Sections 307, 504 and 506 IPC.
The case in brief
While filing the anticipatory bail under Section 438, the Counsels appearing for the minor argued that a minor cannot be deprived of protection available under Section 438 Cr.P.C. just because he is not an adult. On the other hand, this contention was ardently opposed by the State.
In view of the conflict in the views of both the parties, the Court examined the question before it as it whether a CCL can seek anticipatory bail under Section 438 CrPC. 
Court's analysis
At the outset, the Court perused the objectives of the JJ Act and noted that it seeks to deal exhaustively with all matters concerning child offenders including their apprehension, detention, and prosecution. Further, taking into account the content of Section 4 (2) CrPC, the Court observed that the provisions of Cr.P.C. shall apply only where the special enactment is silent on a particular issue.
Against this backdrop, the Court examined the issue as to whether the applicability of Section 438 Cr.P.C. has been ruled out by implication or otherwise in cases where the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 is applicable or not?
The Court observed that under Section 8 (1) of the Juvenile Justice Act, the Juvenile Justice Board has been given exclusive power to deal with all the proceedings under the Act relating to children in conflict with law and in the Act, no window has been left open for meddling with the affairs of juvenile offenders in terms of provisions of Section 438 Cr.P.C.
"The Juvenile Justice Act has no where said that Section 438 Cr.P.C. shall have application to the children in conflict with law. Though Section 8(2) of the Juvenile Justice Act gives similar powers to the High Court or the Children Court but only when matter is brought before it in appeal or revision or otherwise. There is no express provision empowering Children Court or Sessions Court or High Court to assume jurisdiction on itself for grant of anticipatory bail by virtue of provisions of Section 8(2) of the Juvenile Justice Act," the Court observed.
Further, the Court also stressed that there is some commonality between the term arrest and apprehension, however, a milder term of apprehension has been preferred (for a child in conflict with the law) over the other to clinch the idea behind the enactment of this special law and to bring home the essential difference with the term arrest in the sense used in other statutes as the custody of a juvenile is not punitive in nature and is a protective one.
In this regard, the Court also took into account the mandate of Section 12 of the JJ Act [Bail of juvenile] to note that it does not provide for any distinction for applicability of provisions of bail on the lines as has been maintained under the provision of Section 436 to 439 of Cr.P.C.
The Court added that the natural and literal meaning of Section 12 indicated that notwithstanding the category of offences for which the child in conflict with law has been produced or brought before or appeared before the Board, he may be released on bail or he may not be so released and placed under the supervision of a probationary officer or under the care of any fit person and when he is not being released, he can only be kept in an observation home or a place of safety.
"The provisions as discussed above are fundamentally different from the provisions of bail under Cr.P.C. The apprehension of arrest which is a necessary pre-requisite for applicability of Section 438 Cr.P.C. is altogether out of place in cases of juveniles. In my view the word "arrest" is not replaceable by the word "apprehension" in the sense used under the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act," the Court added.
Consequently, the Court held that a distinct and special procedure with regard to a child offender has been put in place in the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 so as to comprehensively deal with all the aspects which may arise where a criminal case, whether initiated by the filing of FIR or not begins and the Act contains many indicators which rule out forming of a view or an opinion that provisions of anticipatory bail shall apply to protect the liberty of a juvenile.

Directing the Thoothukudi District Collector to take a decision on a resident's representation seeking permission to install statues of social reformer Thanthai Periyar and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar at his property, the Madras High Court has said there cannot be any objection from anyone against it as both of them are respected by people in the state.
"As far as Tamil Nadu is concerned, there cannot be any objection from anyone for erecting the statues of Thanthai Periyar or Dr.Ambedkar. The people individually have respects for these leaders," said Justice Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup.
Allowing the prayer for seeking a decision on the petitioner's representation dated August 23, the court said, "The District Collector may pass appropriate orders based on the representation of the Petitioner on merits and in accordance with law within a period of two weeks from the date of this order".
The petitioner in his plea said that earlier he and other persons belonging to the Dravidar Kazhagam, the social movement founded by Periyar, had jointly installed statues of Periyar and Dr. Ambedkar on the highway land adjacent to his property in 1991. 
However, during the extension work of the East Coastal Road project, the full-length statue of Periyar and Dr. Ambedkar was removed temporarily and kept at the petitioner's residence.
 After the project was completed, the petitioner planned to install the statues at his own premises but he was harassed by the police authorities, the plea alleged.
During the hearing, the counsel representing the government informed the court that the Tahsildar had already submitted a report to the District Collector, and that the property belongs to the petitioner. All the revenue records are in his name and there cannot be any objection to put statues of Periyar and Dr Ambedkar in his patta land, the court was told 
The government counsel also said there is no rival claim or objection from anyone, as per the Tahsildar's report. She also referred to the guidelines issued by the Commissionerate of Revenue Administration and Disaster Management in 2019 for installation of the statues. 
"The report of the Tahsildar is in the light of the above letter. The Tahsildar had verified the bona fide of the Petitioner with regard to the claim of the ownership of the land," the government counsel submitted.

He also said that the District Judiciary has delivered 1,61,263 judgments in 2022 compared to 72,806 in 2021. While congratulating the Judges of the High Court and the District Judiciary for improved performance in all spheres, the Chief Justice reminded them not to be complacent. 
He said that through the District Judges’ Conference, the best practices can be identified by sharing of ideas and experiences and those can be emulated. 
Speaking about the Annual Report, he said it was an attempt to make the report card of the judiciary available to the public to ensure accountability and transparency. He also announced that Bolangir, Nayagarh and Deogarh were found to be the Best Performing Districts in Zone ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ respectively for 2022.

In a recent order, the Gujarat High Court has held that the benefits of reinstatement would be a 'normal course' that ought to follow once there is a violative of Section 25(F) under the Industrial Disputes Act. 
Keeping in view this principle, the High Court reinstated, without backwages, the Petitioner who working as a 'sweeper' under the State for 6 years. The Labour Court's award only granting lumpsum compensation to the tune of Rs. 54,000 as was modified to that extent. Justice Biren Vaishnav stated:
"Having therefore found that the Labour Court having positively held that there was violation of Sec.25(F) of the Act, for no fault of the petitioner, the Labour Court proceedings having been prolonged at the instance of the respondents, the petitioner could not have been then deprived of the benefits of reinstatement which is a normal course that ought to have been followed once violation of Sec.25(F) is otherwise proved."
 The observation comes in a petition challenging Labour Court's award granting lump-sum compensation and seeking reinstatement with full backwages and consequential benefits. 
The Petitioner-workman had been removed from service on account of outsourcing policy from May 2006 onwards. Initially, the Labour Court had granted reinstatement with 25% backwages but the same was set aside vide a fresh order in a Miscellaneous Application wherein compensation came to be granted.
 The Petitioner primarily averred that she had worked for 240 days in each year of service continuously and further, the Respondents had failed to adduce any evidence which would establish that the termination was not bad in law. The AGP contrasted this with the argument that the Petitioner was a part-time worker.
 The Labour Court had taken note of Director, Fisheries Terminal Department vs. Bhikubhai Meghajibhai Chavda to conclude that the petitioner was in continuous service of 240 days as defined in Section 25(B) of the Act and therefore, there was violation of provisions of Sec. 25(F) of the Act.
However, the Labour Court had also cited Hari Nandan Prasad & anr vs. Employer I/R to Management of Food Corporation of India & Anr to opine that reinstatement could not be granted due to a lapse of 12 years since termination.
 The High Court was of the view that the Labour Court "materially erred" in not granting the benefit of reinstatement on the ground of period of 12 years having gone by since adjudication.
It observed that violation of Section 25(F) in the present case was 'writ large' and the proceedings were prolonged solely at the instance of the respondents.
 Thus, the Respondents were directed to pass the reinstatement order within 3 months.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court has recently observed that automatic confirmation cannot be claimed as a matter of right after the expiry of probation period, unless there is a vacancy for the same job.
 While modifying the order related to discontinuation of services dated January 2, 2018 ("impugned order") Single Judge bench of Justice GS Ahluwalia remarked that,
 "Expiry of the probation period does not necessarily mean confirmation and at the end/ expiry of the period of probation, normally an order confirming the officer is required to be passed and if no such order is passed, he shall be deemed to have continued on probation unless the terms of appointment or the relevant rules governing the service conditions provide otherwise."
 Facts of the Case
 The petitioner was appointed to the post of Constable for two years and after due medical and character verification was granted by an appointment order dated January 1, 2014. One of the conditions of the appointment order was that in the light of Rule 12 of the Madhya Pradesh Government Servants (Temporary and Quasi-permanent Service) Rules, 1960 (''the Rules,1960''), the petitioner's services could be discontinued by giving one month's notice or one month's advance salary in lieu thereof. On account of sickness of the petitioner's father, he remained absent from his duties with effect from April 15, 2017, and did not submit his joining thereafter and as a result, his services were discontinued by order dated January 2, 2018, as per the provisions of Regulation 59 of the Madhya Pradesh Police Regulations. 
 Against the order dated January 2, 2018, the petitioner had preferred an appeal before the Inspector General of Police, SAF, Gwalior Range, Gwalior which was dismissed on April 9, 2018. The petitioner had also preferred a mercy appeal which too was dismissed by the impugned order dated August 30, 2018.
 The petitioner had thereafter approached the High Court challenging the order dated January 2, 2018.
 Contentions Placed By Counsel(s)
 The petitioner's counsel contended that the order dated January 2, 2018, did not disclose the reasons for putting an end to the petitioner's services but it was specifically mentioned in the appeal that the petitioner was in habit of remaining on unauthorized absence and on one occasion a minor penalty was also imposed on him. The petitioner's counsel further submitted that the reasons assigned by the Appellate Authority were stigmatic in nature and therefore a Departmental Enquiry should have been conducted against the petitioner. It was also submitted that the original period of probation was for two years and according to Regulation 59 of Madhya Pradesh Police Regulations, the period of probation could be extended by a further period of six months for two times. 
 "Since the petitioner was appointed in the year 2014 and although no specific order was issued thereby confirming him in service but as the probation period of the petitioner was not extended after completion of his three years (including the extension period), therefore, it had to be presumed that the petitioner was confirmed in the service and accordingly, his services could not have been terminated without holding a Departmental Enquiry," petitioner's counsel also submitted.
 Opposing the petition vehemently, State's counsel submitted that no reasons were assigned in the impugned order and therefore it was a discontinuation simpliciter without any allegation/ stigma. Since the petitioner had only in the memo of appeal raised the question of absence of reasons, in order to consider the grounds raised in the appeals, the Appellate Authority had considered the previous conduct of the petitioner which couldn't be said to be stigmatic in nature, the State's counsel submitted. It was also his contention that there was no provision of law which provided that if order of extension of probation was not passed after completion of probation period, then an employee should be treated to be confirmed in the service.
 Court's Observations 
 Taking note of the fact that the petitioner did not file any medical prescriptions of his father to show that his father was seriously sick and petitioner's failure to point out any legal provision of law which authorized an employee to remain on unauthorised absence without informing and seeking leave from the Department on any ground, the Court noted that the Government employee could not be permitted to remain on unauthorized absence without informing the Department and specifically when he was a Constable in SAF, being a part of a uniform disciplined force.
 The Bench also took into account the failure of the petitioner's counsel to point out any provision of law which provided that in case the probation period was not extended after the period of three years (including two extensions) from the date of appointment, the petitioner was to be treated as a confirmed employee.
 Therefore the Court while relying on Rule 8 and Rule 12 of the 1960 Rules said that temporary employee's services could be terminated by either issuing one month's notice by making payment of one month's advance salary in lieu of notice and remarked that,
 "If the order dated 02/01/2018 is tested in the light of Rule 12 of the Rules, 1960, then it is clear that neither one month's notice has been given nor one month's salary in advance has been paid in lieu of the notice as required under Rule 12 of the Rules, 1960."
 In light of the circumstances and relying on the Top Court's judgment in Tarsem Lal Verma vs. Union of India and Others (1997) 9 SCC 243, Registrar, High Court of Gujarat vs. C.G. Sharma (2005) 1 SCC 132 and C. V. Satheeshchandran vs. General Manager, UCO Bank and Others (2008) 2 SCC 653 , the Court opined that the impugned order required modification and accordingly observed that the petitioner was entitled to one month's salary in lieu of one month's notice and also affirmed the modification order dated April 9, 2018 and August 30, 2018. Directions were also issued for paying the petitioner one month's salary within a period of three months from the date of order.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed the applications filed by certain banks seeking to recall the 2015 judgment in the case Reserve Bank of India v Jayantilal N. Mistry which had held that the RBI was obliged to disclose defaulters list, inspection reports, annual statements etc., related to banks under the RTI Act.
A bench comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran dismissed the applications observing that the Supreme Court Rules did not have any provision for filing any application for recall of a judgment.
"There is no provision in the Supreme Court Rules for filing any application for recall of the judgment of this Court", the bench observed.
However, the bench has given liberty to the applicants to pursue other available legal remedies against the Jayantilal Mistry judgment.
About the Jayantilal Mistry case
In the Jayantilal Mistry case, the Supreme Court had rejected the argument of the Reserve Bank of India that it was holding the information of banks in a fiduciary capacity, and therefore such information was exempted from disclosure under the Right to Information Act as per Section 8(1)(e).
The Apex Court was considering a batch of transferred cases from various High Courts wherein the order passed by the Central Information Commission (CIC) directing the RBI to furnish the Information sought to the applicants under the RTI Act.
A bench comprising Jusitces MY Eqbal and C Nagappan had held that RBI does not place itself in a fiduciary relationship with the Financial institutions because, the reports of the inspections, statements of the bank, information related to the business obtained by the RBI are not under the pretext of confidence or trust.
The Court held that information obtained under a regulatory capacity or under the mandate of law cannot be termed as information held under fiduciary capacity.
"RBI is supposed to uphold public interest and not the interest of individual banks. RBI is clearly not in any fiduciary relationship with any bank. RBI has no legal duty to maximize the benefit of any public sector or private sector bank, and thus there is no relationship of 'trust' between them. RBI has a statutory duty to uphold the interest of the public at large, the depositors, the country's economy and the banking sector. Thus, RBI ought to act with transparency and not hide information that might embarrass individual banks", the judgment stated.
The Court expressed the opinion that the RBI has to act with transparency and not hide information that might embarrass the banks and that it is duty bound to comply withthe provisions of the Act and disclose the information sought
Later, contempt petitions were filed after the RBI contending that the disclosure policy framed by the RBI in 2016 were contrary to the directions in the Jayantlal Mistry judgment.
In April 2019, a bench comprising Justices Nageswara Rao and MR Shah directed the RBI to withdraw the disclosure policy to the extent it permitted exemptions contrary to the Supreme Court verdict (Girish Mittal v. Parvati V. Sundaram & Anr). The Court held that the violations of its direction by the RBI will be viewed seriously.
Recall applications not maintainable; they are review applications in disguise
Following that, HDFC Bank, State Bank of India and few other banks filed application seeking recall of the Jayantlal Mistry case. They contended that the judgment was passed without hearing them, and hence was in violation of the principles of natural justice. It was further contended that the judgment required reconsideration after the Supreme Court declared "right to privacy" to be a fundamental right in 2017 in the KS Puttaswamy case.
Rejecting these arguments, the bench first said that the Supreme Court rules did not permit the filing of an application seeking recall of a judgment.
As regards the applicants' argument that the recall applications are maintainable when the judgment is passed without hearing the affected party, the bench noted that it was decision of RBI which was under challenge in that case.
Also, none of the banks made any effort to get themselves impleaded in the case, when it was being heard by the Court.
The bench observed that the recall applications are essentially review applications in disguise.
"The applications styled as recall are essentially applications for review. The nomenclature given to an application is of absolutely no consequence -what is of importance is the substance of the application. A close scrutiny of the applications for recall makes it clear that in substance, the applicants are seeking a review of the judgment in Jayantilal N.Mistry (supra). Therefore, we are of the considered opinion that these applications are not maintainable", the order written by Justice Rao said.
Case Details
Title : Reserve Bank of India v Jayantilal N. Mistry 
Bench : Justices L Nageswara Rao & Vineet Saran
.

The Karnataka High Court has directed the Managing Director of State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) to institute a proper Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to ensure that no contradictory stand is taken by any of the disciplinary authorities and/or the authorities who file written statements in the Motor Accident claim proceedings.
 A single judge bench of Justice Suraj Govindaraj said, "if any such event occurs, necessary disciplinary proceedings to be initiated against such persons by following the applicable rules." It added, "Instructions to be also issued that a statement to be made in any written statement filed in a Motor Vehicle Accident claim petition, if any disciplinary proceedings are initiated or not."
 The bench made the observations while hearing a petition filed by the corporation challenging an award passed by the Principal District Judge at Tumkur in 2018, by which it directed the corporation to reinstate Ganganna, a driver who was involved in a road accident in 2015.
 The judge had allowed the claim petition of the workman and set aside the dismissal order directing the reinstatement of the respondent-workman into service with continuity of service and without back wages from the date of dismissal, but withholding three increments.
 During the hearing the bench called for the defence taken by the corporation in the motor vehicle accident Claim Petition, filed under the Motor Vehicles Act.
 On going through the same the bench noted that the Road Transport Corporation has certified the driving of the respondent-workman and has categorically stated that the bus was being driven slowly and carefully on the left side of the road and it is further alleged that the rider of the motor vehicle came from the opposite direction in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the front side of the bus. It was contended that sole responsibility for the accident rested with the rider of the motorcycle, and on that basis, it was contended that the Road Transport Corporation ought not to be made responsible for the compensation which has been sought for in the M.V. case.
 However, the bench noted that the Divisional Controller of K.B.S. Division was of the categorical opinion that the bus was being driven in a rash and negligent manner, and the same was informed to KSRTC Managing Director by way of a fax message. 
Thus, the bench observed that it remains to be explained by the Managing Director as to how the defence in M.V. Case was taken that the driver was driving in a proper manner and that it is the two wheeler rider who was driving in a rash and negligent manner. 
"The Road Transport Corporation, in order to escape its liability in the M.A.C.T. matter, has taken up the contention that the driver was driving in a proper manner and rider of the two wheeler was driving in a rash and negligent manner but on the other hand in the disciplinary proceedings it is contended that its own driver was rash and negligent...It is required for any litigant more so an instrumentality of the state to adhere to one set of facts and not change the set of facts depending on its convenience and/or requirements."
 It held that once the driver stood absolved by the said written statement, it is impermissible for the Road Transport Corporation to initiate the disciplinary enquiry.
 The Court said that it was for the KSTRC to have come clean and clearly and categorically stated in M.V. case that it was the driver's fault for driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and offered to make payment of the compensation due in the said proceedings. "It is only in order to try and escape the payment of compensation that a false stand has been taken by the Road Transport Corporation, which is established to be false by the contents of the present writ petition as also by the M.A.C.T. in its order dated 08.09.2016 in the aforesaid M.V.Cs."
 Further it said, "It is also relevant to take note that not only was the precious time of the M.A.C.T. wasted by taking the said false defence offered by the Road Transport Corporation, but more importantly, the victim of the road accident was denied immediate relief, and succour by way of payment of compensation. The said payment being delayed until the finding being rendered by the M.A.C.T. after evidence being led. These kind of actions on part of the Road Transport Corporation are required to be deprecated and are deprecated."
 Accordingly it dismissed the petition.

The Gujarat High Court has dismissed a petition moved by two Railway Stations Auto Rikshaw Drivers' Unions seeking financial assistance from the State Government under the Atma Nirbhav Gujarat Scheme after observing that the petitioners cannot claim financial assistance as a matter of right. Observing that all businesses and professions have badly been hit by the covid 19 pandemic, a division bench comprising of Justice Bela M. Trivedi and Justice Bhargav D. Karia observed thus:
"It cannot be gainsaid that the rigour of Covid Pandemic had affected the lives and livelihood of people world over and has caused great financial losses to every sector of the society." Furthermore, it said:
"Under the circumstances, the petitioners cannot claim as a matter of right to get financial assistance or monetary benefits for auto rickshaw drivers, more particularly when all the businesses and professions have been badly affected due to the Pandemic." The development came after the petitioners approached the High Court challenging State Government's order dated 12th March 2021 wherein it was resolved that a separate relief package for the auto-rickshaw drivers in view of the Atma Nirbhar Gujarat Sahay Yojna will not be granted. In view of this, the plea sought reasonable financial assistance to the members of the petitioners unions for the period of lockdown and thereafter for the survival of their families in view of sec. 12 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. During the course of hearing, Advocate KR Koshti appearing for the petitioners submitted that huge financial loss was suffered by members of the unions and that the State had not granted any specific reliefs or facilities to the persons who are working as unorganized or self employed workers. Therefore, it was submitted that the auto rickshaw drivers should have been treated as self- dependent persons and should have been given special relief package by providing financial assistance under the provisions contained in the Disaster Management Act. "It can also not be denied that the State Government considering the plight of the people at large has provided reliefs in terms of free food, medical cover and shelter, etc. from time to time and has also granted ex-gratia assistance on account of loss of livelihood." The Court said at the outset.

The Delhi High Court has granted interim injunction in favour of Star India Pvt. Ltd., restraining certain 'rogue websites' from streaming, broadcasting or sharing through the internet the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2021.
Star India claims to have acquired exclusive global media rights for various ICC events from the International Cricket Council for a duration of eight years i.e., from 2015–2023.
It has filed a suit to seeking to permanently restrain the Defendants from infringing its exclusive rights and broadcasting reproduction rights, rendition of accounts, damages etc.
Observing that a prima facie case is made out in Star India's favour, Justice Sanjeev Narula directed the Internet Service Providers to block access to the seven websites within 72 hours and also directed Department of Telecommunications and Ministry of Electronics and Information and Technology to issue notification calling upon the internet and telecom service providers to block access to said websites.
The seven rogue websites as mentioned by the media company are filmyclub.wapkiz.com, ipl.hitcric.tv, doratv-ipl.wapkiz.com, tamilblasters.win, thdtvworld.xyz, uptomovie.xyz and zolhdtv.com.
During the course of hearing, Senior Advocate Amit Sibal appearing for the plaintiffs submitted that the defendants had earlier also infringed their exclusive rights for 'Vivo IPL 2021'.
It was the apprehension of the plaintiffs that the defendants will continue infringing their exclusive rights with respect to the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2021 that commenced from 17th October, 2021.
Screenshots of one of the "rogue websites" were also annexed with the plaint to demonstrate that it mentions various sporting events to be held/ streamed on the website, including ICC Men's CWC.
It was argued by the plaintiffs that the information regarding the defendant-websites was completely masked and that they were not aware of the owners of the websites as they were either anonymous or had incorrect addresses.
"..prima facie, sufficient material has been placed on record by the Plaintiffs, this Court finds a prima facie case in favour of the Plaintiffs. The balance of convenience also lies in favour of the Plaintiffs and in case an ex-parte ad- interim injunction is not granted, an irreparable loss will be inflicted upon the Plaintiffs. Consequently, till the next date of hearing before this Court, interim injunction is granted in favour of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendants," the Court ordered.
The matter will now be heard on 28th February, 2022.

The Allahabad High Court today quashed a summoning order issued by a Court of the Magistrate against the Editor-In-Chief of the daily newspaper Dainik Jagran, Sanjay Gupta for publishing an alleged defamatory news item.
The Bench of Justice Syed Aftab Husain Rizvi noted that in absence of specific allegations against the Chief Editor, the person holding the post can't be summoned.
The case in brief
Essentially, the opposite party no.2 filed a complaint before the concerned Magistrate alleging therein that a news item was published in Bareilly edition of Dainik Jagaran in April 2016, whereunder defamatory and malicious imputation were made against the complainant.
The Complainant had alleged that the news item in question stated that a case had been registered against the complainant and his brother in connection with an attempt to murder and assault (maarpeet) case, whereas, they are reputed and respected persons and are not involved in any criminal case.
Lastly, it was alleged that through the said news item, the Bureau Chief Devendra Deva, Editor-in-Chief Sanjay Gupta, printer and publisher, and General Manager Anugrah Narain Singh disreputed the complainant. 
The complainant examined himself under Section 200 Cr.P.C. and produced other witnesses under section 202 CrPC, and thereafter, the Magistrate summoned the applicant (Gupta) and three others to face trial for offence under section 500 IPC. 
Before the Court, the counsel for the applicant argued that the said news item was published on the basis of an FIR wherein the complainant and others were named as accused. It was also submitted that the applicant is not responsible for day-to-day reporting in local editions and same is done under the knowledge and supervision of editors and local reporters.
Court's observations
At the outset, the Court noted that it was undisputed that the applicant is Editor-in-Chief of Jagran Prakashan Ltd and there was no specific averment in relation to him in the complaint.
The Court took into account the observations of the Apex Court in the case of KM Mathew vs. State of Kerala 1991 LawSuit(SC) 598 wherein it was observed that the Chief Editor of a newspaper cannot be prosecuted if there are no positive averments in the complaint regarding his/her culpability. 
Further, the Court noted that in the case of Vivek Goenka vs. State of Maharashtra and Another 2007 CRI. L. J. 2194, the Bombay High Court had held that the person whose name is printed as Editor or Resident Editor is responsible for the publication of news item and the Chairman or Managing Editor would not be responsible for the news item published. 
In view of this and taking into account the facts of the instant case, the Court observed thus as it quashed the summoning order:
"Being Editor-in-Chief in absence of specific allegations against the applicant the legal bar will apply against him. He cannot be held responsible and prosecuted for any news item published in any edition of the newspaper. The learned Magistrate has failed to consider the legal aspect of the matter and has passed the summoning order, in violation of legal provisions, hence summoning order in respect of the applicant is not sustainable and is liable to be quashed."

In an appeal from a motor accident claim, the Allahabad High Court recently underscored the importance of ensuring the claimant(s) received the compensation they were entitled to in the event of a dispute between the owner of the vehicle that caused the accident and the insurer.
To this end, the Bench of Justices Dr Kaushal Jayendra Thaker and Justice Ajit Singh emphasised that even the heirs of the claimant, once their status as heirs was established, would be entitled to claim compensation due to the original claimant. 
Relying on Surpal Singh Ladhubha Gohil v Raliyatbahen Mohanbhai Savlia it was stated,
"The facts go to show that the claimant was under the constant treatment of doctors till the claimant survived therefore, it can safely be held that the accident caused lot of trauma both to the claimant as well his heirs. There is nexus between the death of the deceased and accidental injury. There is sufficient evidence to the effect that death of the deceased was due to development which took place due to resultant multiple injuries caused by the accident which would show that injuries were the root cause of the death. Therefore, heirs are entitled to compensation."
What transpired in the case
 After the original claimant met with a motor accident in February 2005, he approached the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal in September. Summons was accordingly in 2007 issued to the owner of the vehicle (though this was subsequently disputed). 
 The Insurance Company filed one reply presented in 2009 denying liability after a request for an adjournment was made in 2008. In 2010, the Insurance Company was allowed to contest the proceedings. After this, the Tribunal passed an award in favour of the claimant. Since the owner did not present himself, the Tribunal concluded that the vehicle could not have neem insured on the date of the accident.
 Thereafter, the claimant took out execution proceedings against the owner in 2011. Notice was issued and unresponded to. After two years, when the tribunal passed an attachment warrant against him, the owner presented himself and challenged the Tribunal's award as ex-parte. He filed an application under Order 9 Rule 13 of C.P.C., contending that he was never served with any summons/notice and came to know of the proceedings only later. His vehicle was insured with respondent no 2 (Insurance Company) who would be liable to satisfy the decree, he averred. The Tribunal thereafter stayed the award and no further steps were taken. The claimant died during the pendency of the proceedings and his heirs argued that his death resulted from the injuries sustained in the accident. The Award was then set aside on the ground of the original claimant's demise. 
 What the Court held
 The High Court reasoned that the decree could have been set aside in part, with the dispute between the owner of the vehicle and the insurance company decided as between themselves. The claimants ought to have been allowed their rightful compensation, the Court concluded.
 Therefore, the Court allowed the heirs of the claimant compensation of Rs 24 Lakhs along with interest amounting to 7.5% per annum from the date of the filing of the claim petition till the date of actual deposit.
 Importantly, the Court said –
 "The Tribunals in the State shall follow the direction of this Court as herein afore mentioned as far as disbursement is concerned, it should look into the condition of the litigant and the pendency of the matter… The same is to be applied looking to the facts of each case."
 The Bench its gratitude for the assistance of the Counsel who appeared in the case.
  Observations
 "It can be safely culled out from the record that the main purpose for filing the application under Order 9 Rule 13 C.P.C. by the owner was to see that the liability is mulcted on the Insurance Company and not on them. The decree could have been set aside in part namely qua issue of liability as it was a award which could be set aside in part there was definitely severable decree"
 The Court also narrated the facts of in Surpal Singh Ladhubha Gohil v Raliyatbahen Mohanbhai Savlia to demonstrate that heirs could be allowed the compensation that was due to the original claimants 
"The death of original claimant during pendency of claim petition his legal heirs being brought on record and where the Tribunal held that claimants would not be entitled to compensation since they have no right to continue the proceedings on the death of original claimant, since action for personal injury abates with the death of original claimant. The question whether maxim "actio personalis moritur cum persona" namely that personal right of action abates with the death of the person, can be imported to a social welfare legislation so as to deny the benefits to legal heirs of a deceased claimant, to the advantage of a wrong doer the High Court held that strict application of maxim "actio personlis mortiur cum persona" cannot be imported to defeat the purpose and object of a social welfare legislation like Motor Vehicles Act. Once the status of claimants as legal heirs or legal representatives is conceded and acknowledged, to deny benefit of compensation to them on the ground that injury was personal to the claimant, it will be giving a premium to the wrong doer and it would defeat the very purpose and object of beneficial piece legislation. The question whether injury was personal or otherwise is of no significance so far as wrong doer is concerned and he is obliged to make good the loss sustained by injured, even after death of injured, claim petition does not abate and right to sue survives to his heirs and legal representatives."
The Court again held -
 "In our case Order 9 Rule 13 C.P.C. could not have been made applicable by setting aside the entire decree instead partial modification 14 of decree even in execution could have been resorted to which would have served the purpose of all the litigating parties. Even if during the execution, proceedings it was brought to the notice of the executing court that the vehicle was insured, the liability could have been fastened on the contesting insurance company with whom the vehicle was insured."
 Speaking of what would have been the outcome had the award not been set aside, the Bench said - 
 "In the event the decree would have been executed, of course, the claimants would have got the benefit of the decretal amount during the life-time of the original claimant who breathed his last in 2013. Had an illegal stay would not have been granted, what would have been the position. The Tribunal instead of granting stay could have directed the Insurance Company to verify the documents and deposited the amount as per the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 more particularly Section 169 read with Section 170 and further Section 174 of the Act. 33. It is settled position of law that the award of the Claims Tribunal shall be paid by owner or driver of the vehicle in the accident and they would be indemnified by insurer or by all or any of them, as the case may be."
 The Bench therefore concluded that the Tribunal acted in a very casual manner by not deciding the matter for a period of five years namely 2013 till 2018. It said -
"The Tribunal committed a mistake rather irregularity by setting aside the award and decree in totality under Order 9 Rule 13 C.P.C. after the death of the original claimant without impleading the legal heirs. The Tribunal further committed an error which is apparent on the face of record by re-deciding the compensation. The only new circumstances were death of the injured claimant and production of documents so as to prove that the vehicle was insured and there was no breach of policy condition. 37. The awards passed by of the Claims Tribunal must be in conformity with the provisions of Section 166 read with Section 169 and 170 of the Act will also go to show that the Tribunal has erred in exercising power under Order 9 Rule 13 of C.P.C. The decisions impugned are not in conformity with the object of the Act. The findings are perverse and do not satisfy the legislative intent of the Act. The claimants were under the impression that the lis was between the owner and the Insurance Company and had the owner deposited the entire amount which he was supposed to, he could have recovered the same from the Insurance Company; if he had proved that there was no breach of policy condition. The primary duty to satisfy the decree is on the driver and owner of the offending vehicle. The only basis of challenge was that the owner had all the documents and therefore, it was the liability of the Insurance Company to indemnify as per the Act…. The provisions of part – II namely Sections 36 to 74 as well as Order 21 of C.P.C. relates to the payment of money under decree. The process for execution was also stayed without any order directing part compliance of the decree as required under the the provisions of Order 21 Rule 26 C.P.C and that the order staying the execution to the detrimental of the claimant could not have been passed 19 ex parte frustrating the very provision of the Code and Act."
Message to Tribunals in the State
 The Bench directed Tribunals in the State to "follow the direction of this Court as herein afore mentioned as far as disbursement is concerned, it should look into the condition of the litigant and the pendency of the matter and not blindly apply the judgment of A.V. Padma). The same is to be applied looking to the facts of each case. A copy of this Judgment be circulated by the learned Registrar General to the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals in the State of Uttar Pradesh for guidance after seeking approval of the Hon'ble the Chief Justice".

The Supreme Court held that a government employee who is a Kashmiri Migrant cannot retain Government accommodation for a period exceeding three years.
The Court held that the Office Memorandum allowing the retired Government employees who are Kashmiri Migrants to retain Government accommodation for indefinite long period is unconstitutional for being as being totally arbitrary and discriminatory.
There cannot be any justification on the basis of social or economic criteria to allow the Kashmiri Migrants to stay in Government accommodation for indefinite long period, the bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and AS Bopanna observed. The bench observed that  
Recently, the court had set aside a Punjab and Haryana High Court order allowing a retired Intelligence Bureau Officer to retain Government accommodation. 
In this case, the court was considering some miscellaneous applications seeking recall of certain orders passed by the Court. The court noticed an office memorandum allowing government accommodation to the retired Government employees who are Kashmiri Migrants. In this regard, the court made the following observations:
Classification Discriminatory
The compassion shown to Kashmiri Migrants has to be balanced with the expectations of the serving officers to discharge their duties effectively. The Government accommodation is meant for serving officers and cannot be taken as a recourse to stay in Government accommodation for the life time of the Government servants or his/her spouse..We find that the Office Memorandum allowing government accommodation to the retired Government employees who are Kashmiri Migrants cannot meet the touchstone of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The Government houses/flats are meant for serving Government employees. Post retirement, the government employees including Kashmiri Migrants are granted pensionary benefits including monthly pension. The classification made in favour of Government employees who were Kashmiri Migrants  stands on the same footing as that of other Government employees or public figures. There cannot be any justification on the basis of social or economic criteria to allow the Kashmiri Migrants to stay in Government accommodation for indefinite long period.
Totally arbitrary and discriminatory
To say that they would return to the Valley when the situation will improve is an open-ended statement capable of being interpreted in different ways. The satisfaction of improvement of situation would be widely different by the erstwhile Government employees and the State. But in no case it can be countenanced that the former Government employee, may be a Kashmiri Migrant, is entitled to stay in a government accommodation for an indefinite period. Thus, we are unable to uphold the Office Memorandum and strike it down as being totally arbitrary and discriminatory.
The court noted that in Para 2(ii) of the Scheme, Kashmiri Pandits were to be accommodated in Delhi for first five years starting from the date of their retirement and thereafter be shifted to National Capital Region.
"Thus, we find it reasonable if Kashmiri Migrants are allowed government accommodation for a period of three years from the date of retirement so as to make alternative arrangements within such period. If an alternative accommodation is not available for them at their instance, they are at liberty to move to the transit accommodation or to avail cash amount in lieu of transit accommodation. Thus, a government employee who is a Kashmiri Migrant would not be entitled to retain Government accommodation for a period exceeding three years, may be in Delhi or in the National Capital Region or for that matter anywhere in the country. 
Cooling off period 
 The three-years period can also be considered as cooling off period for the officers who were in active intelligence work so that they can resume normal life but the excuse of once working for intelligence agency is not a valid ground to to occupy the Government accommodation for indefinite period.

Coram: Justices Hemant Gupta and AS Bopanna 

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently observed that the perversity of an action or decision by a public authority/official, acting in the domain of public administration, irrespective of the tier of the administration, has no hiding from the pendular gaze of the Rule of Law which may for a given case get late but not defaults in catching up with the wrong deed and wrongdoer masquerading in the domain of the public administration.
The observations were made by Justice Rahul Bharti while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had challenged the engagement of respondent no. 6 as an Anganwadi Worker at the cost of the entitlement of the petitioner.
In the instant matter the petitioner, who was supposed to be engaged as being at the number one position in the panel as an Anganwadi Worker had got duped of her said entitlement by contrivance on the part of the Sarpanch of the village to get his daughter-in-law to be engaged in which three government officials had lent their full role. 
The engagement of respondent no. 6 as an Anganwadi Worker at the cost of the petitioner was sourced to an alleged affidavit dated November 24 2011 attributed to the petitioner and taken cognizance of by a three-member Selection Committee.
It was on the basis of this document that the three-member Selection Committee had concluded that the petitioner will not work as an Anganwadi Worker and accordingly a way was paved for respondent no. 6 to get an engagement order.
In his plea the petitioner called the engagement of respondent no. 6 a foul play at the end of the official respondents concerned, engineered by respondent no. 7 to bring the undue and undeserving engagement of his daughter-in-law i.e. respondent no. 6 as an Anganwadi Worker for the Anganwadi Centre.
Dealing with the matter Justice Bharti noted that the affidavit which proved to be a game changer in the matter bears a verification and attestation by and before the Tehsildar Executive Magistrate 1st Class, Sunderbani and incidentally it was the respondent no. 7 who had identified the petitioner.
After closely examining the Affidavit the bench observed that the court has no iota of doubt that the petitioner became the victim of foul play at the end of respondent no. 7 to which active and passive facilitation was extended by the three-member Selection Committee comprising of the officials of the time who served as the Child Development Project Officer ICDS Project Sunderbani, the District Social Welfare Officer Rajouri and the Programme Officer, ICDS Project Rajouri.
Pointing out to the fact that the selection panel was prepared on Feb 06th 2012 and before that it was not in any manner possible for the petitioner, who is a middle-pass BPL category woman, to know beforehand in November 2011 that it is she who was going to be number one in merit, the court reasoned that the coming into picture of an affidavit dated November 24th 2011 allegedly attributed to the petitioner, even if the signatures of the petitioner on the said affidavit are genuine, cannot be said to be an act of the petitioner being conscious of the contents of the affidavit, its import and the effect and the purpose for which it was to be used.
Highlighting the deception practised against the petitioner the court observed that what was known only to the three-member selection committee in terms of the final position of the candidates was already known to respondent no. 7 who activated his machination to play deception upon the petitioner as is evident from the very text of the affidavit itself in which the petitioner in November 2011 is assuming herself to be the number one candidate and tendering her abandonment in favour of the second candidate, which incidentally in terms of the merit list prepared on 06.02.2012 came to be the respondent no. 6.
"It is in this context that the act of respondent no. 7 in identifying the petitioner concerning the attestation of the alleged affidavit of the petitioner before the Tesildar Executive Magistrate 1st Class, Sunderbani carries significance and is a pointer to the fact that respondent no. 7 was enjoying very active feedback of information from the end of the said three-member Selection Committee", the bench recorded.
Expressing displeasure on the actions of the respondents the court observed that the connivance at the end of the members of the Selection Committee and respondent no. 7 was contrived and corrupt in nature and intent to deprive the petitioner of her merit-based entitlement and bestow wrongful gain in favour of respondent no. 6.
"This Court cannot lend any legitimacy to this fraud and as such the engagement of the respondent no. 6 has to be held and is held to be null and void ab initio, and as such, is set aside", said the court.
Additionally, the court directed the Anti Corruption bureau Bureau Rajouri to undertake an enquiry into the matter to ascertain the culpability, departmental or criminal, if any, official respondents who then constituted the Selection Committee and on the part of respondent no. 7.
The bench further ordered the engagement of the petitioner as Anganwadi Worker with a further direction that the same shall be deemed to be with retrospective effect on a notional basis.

The Allahabad High Court recently granted bail to a woman, accused of abducting a 19-year-old girl and forcing her to convert her religion.
 The woman has been charged by the UP Police under the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020.
 The provisions of the Ordinance, that have now taken force as an Act, declare unlawful religious conversion as a cognizable and non-bailable offence.
 It provides- No person shall convert or attempt to convert, either directly or otherwise, any other person from one religion to another by use or practice of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage nor shall any person abet, convince or conspire such conversion:
 Section 5 of the Act prescribes a minimum punishment of 1 year, which may extend to 5 years, and fine of at least Rs. 15,000/- in case of such unlawful conversion.
 In the instant case, the Applicant Chandbibi had sought bail in connection with a FIR registered at the Tambaur Police Station in Sitapur District for the alleged commission of offences under Sections 364, 366, 368 and 120-B of IPC and Section 3/5 of the Ordinance.
 Chandbibi claimed that she was not named in the FIR and had been falsely implicated in the case.
 It was submitted that the victim was not recovered from her custody and as per the prosecution case, the victim had appeared before the Police Station along with her father, soon after the abduction.
 She further submitted that when the victim's statement under Section 161 of CrPC was recorded by the Investigating Officer, no allegation of any kind was levelled against her.
 The Additional Government Advocate however opposed the prayer for bail on the ground that in the additional statement of the prosecutrix, it was specifically stated that amongst other persons who were instrumental in pressurizing her for changing her religion, the instant Applicant was one of them. 
 The Single Bench of Justice Mohd. Faiz Alam Khan however noted that the in her statement under Section 164 CrPC, the prosecutrix had not made any imputation against the Applicant.
 The Bench was informed that in her statement under Section 164, the prosecutrix made no allegation of any kind either regarding kidnapping or of any abetment, against the Applicant. In fact, she had categorically stated that she went with co-accused Jibraeel on her own volition and free will and she is in love with him and that she had changed religion on her own volition.
 Considering the totality of the facts, and that Charge sheet has already been submitted, the Bench said that it finds substance for the purpose of releasing the Applicant on bail.
 Other orders on religious conversions
 Last year, the High Court had stayed the arrest of one Nadeem, booked by under the Ordinance, accused of developing an illicit relation with the Complainant's wife with the purpose of converting her religion.
 "Victim is admittedly an adult who understands her well being. She as well as the petitioner have a fundamental right to privacy and being grown up adults who are aware of the consequences of their alleged relationship," a Division Bench comprising of Justices Pankaj Naqvi and Vivek Agarwal had observed.
 Earlier this month, the Madhya Pradesh High Court granted Anticipatory Bail to a Catholic nun, booked under MP's anti-religious conversion law, for allegedly attempting to convert a Hindu woman to Christianity.
 It was alleged by the complainant that her husband, who was ailing with a mental disorder, was promised to be cured by the applicant herein if the complainant and her family got converted to Christianity. It was also stated in the FIR that she (the applicant) had given the allurement that the Christian God is greater than the Hindu God.
 On the other hand, the counsel for the applicant submitted that the complaint is false and registered only out of a sense of frustration experienced by the complainant on account of her being terminated from the service of the Convent.
 Having heard both the parties, the Court ordered that till the next date of hearing, the applicant be enlarged upon temporary bail.
 Case Title: Chandbibi v. State of UP
 Read Order

The Bombay High Court at Goa has held that failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts is an essential jurisdictional parameter that must be fulfilled before any notice can be issued for reopening the assessment proceedings after the expiration of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year.
The division bench of Justice M.S. Sonak and Justice Bharat P. Deshpande has observed that in the absence of any allegation or a plain statement about compliance with the jurisdictional parameter, the reassessment notice cannot be ordinarily sustained.
The petitioner has challenged the reopening of the assessment for the assessment year 2012–13 on the ground that there was no failure on the part of the petitioner to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for its assessment for that assessment year. Therefore, no notice for reopening the assessment could have been issued after the expiration of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year.
The department contended that even if some latitude is extended to the Revenue by overlooking the absence of allegation about failure to disclose material facts, the record bears out that the petitioner made complete disclosures in the present case. Consequently, even on the basis of facts, the Revenue failed to establish any failure to disclose truly and fully all material facts necessary for its assessment for AY 2012–13.
The petitioner contended that it did not fail to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for its assessment of the relevant AY 2012–13. The notice, therefore, cannot be sustained.
The court held that there is a well-known difference between a wrong claim by an assessee after disclosing the true and material facts and a wrong claim made by the assessee by withholding the material facts fully and truly. Only in the latter case would the assessing officer be entitled to reopen the assessment after four years.
Case Title: Chowgule & Company (P) Ltd. Versus JCIT
Date: 06.12.2022
Counsel For Petitioner: Senior Advocate Firoze Andhyarujina, Manek Adhjyarujina, Shreya Arur, S. Kenny
Counsel For Respondent: Standing Counsel Amira Razaq

The Kerala High Court recently refused to quash the criminal proceedings that had been initiated against a person for allegedly raping a woman under the false promise of marriage, on the ground that the facts prima facie established that he had never intended to marry her.
Justice K. Babu perused Section 90 of the Indian Penal Code which refers to the expression 'consent', and noted that for the purposes of Section 375, consent requires voluntary participation not only after the exercise of intelligence based on the knowledge of the significance and moral quality of the act but after having fully exercised the choice between resistance and assent. 
The Court further noted that whether there was consent or not could only be ascertained on a careful study of all relevant circumstances.
Elucidating the difference between rape and consensual sex, the Court observed, 
"There is a clear distinction between rape and consensual sex, and the court must very carefully examine whether the accused had actually wanted to marry the victim, or had mala fide motives, and had made a false promise to this effect only to satisfy his lust, as the latter falls within the ambit of cheating or deception. There is a distinction between the mere breach of a promise, and not fulfilling a false promise. Thus, the court must examine whether there was made, at an early stage, a false promise of marriage by the accused; and whether the consent involved was given after wholly understanding the nature and consequences of sexual indulgence".
Justice Babu took note of the Apex Court decision in Pramod Suryabhan Pawar v. State of Maharashtra (2019), wherein the Court had summarized the two propositions to find whether the 'consent' was vitiated by a 'misconception of fact' arising out of a promise to marry, namely, (1) The promise of marriage must have been a false promise, given in bad faith and with no intention of being adhered to at the time it was given. (2) The false promise itself must be of immediate relevance, or bear a direct nexus to the woman’s decision to engage in the sexual act. 
As per the facts of the case, the petitioner and the victim had been colleagues when he told her that he liked her and offered to marry her. When the petitioner repeatedly offered to marry her, the victim agreed to marry him. It is noted that both of them travelled to many places together. It has been alleged that the petitioner sexually ill-treated the victim, and appropriated her gold ornaments. It has been alleged that the petitioner had raped the victim, and also had physical relations with her on the false promise of marriage. However, he later avoided the victim and refused to marry her. 
The counsels appearing on behalf of the petitioner contended that the prosecution had failed to prima facie establish a false promise of marriage in this case. It was argued that at most, the facts only revealed a 'breach of promise' which the petitioner had made in good faith, but had not subsequently fulfilled. 
This was however disputed by the counsels for the respondents who said the acts of the accused fall under the definition of 'rape' since the consent of the victim had been obtained under a misconception of facts defined under Section 90 of I.P.C. 
The Court thus ascertained that the facts prima facie establish that the petitioner had never intended to marry the victim and procured her consent only for having sexual relations with her, thereby making it fall under the definition of 'rape'. 
It observed that the power of quashing criminal proceedings ought to be exercised sparingly, and with circumspection, and that too in the rarest of rare cases. It added that the Court could not enquire as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR, unless the allegations are so patently absurd and inherently improbable so that no prudent person can ever reach such a conclusion. 
"The extraordinary and inherent powers of the Court do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the Court to act according to its whims or caprice," said the court, adding that even in exceptional cases, the High Court can only look into those documents which are unimpeachable and can be legally translated into relevant evidence. 
The court said the criminal proceedings in the present case not liable to be quashed, and accordingly, dismissed the petition. 
The petitioner was represented by Senior Advocate K.P. Satheeshan, and Advocates S.K. Adhithyan and Bhavya Binu. Public Prosecutor G. Sudheer, and Advocates Geetha Job Ozhukayil, Tanya Tom, and Tom Jose appeared on behalf of the respondents.

The Supreme Court has observed that forcing an unwilling party to undergo DNA test impinges on personal liberty and right to privacy.
"When the plaintiff is unwilling to subject himself to the DNA test, forcing him to undergo one would impinge on his personal liberty and his right to privacy", observed a bench comprising Justices R Subhash Reddy and Hrishikesh Roy.
"In circumstances where other evidence is available to prove or dispute the relationship, the court should ordinarily refrain from ordering blood tests. This is because such tests impinge upon the right of privacy of an individual and could also have major societal repercussions", the judgment added. 
Holding so, the bench set aside the judgment of the High Court which had directed the plaintiff in a suit to undergo DNA test(case :Ashok Kumar v. Raj Gupta and others).
Factual Background
The suit was filed by the plaintiff seeking declaration of ownership of property left behind by late Trilok Chand Gupta and late Sona Devi. The plaintiff claimed to be the son of late Trilok Chand Gupta and Sona Devi, and arrayed their daughters as the defendants in the suit. The defendants disputed the plaintiff's claim and denied any relationship with him.
During the trial, the defendants filed an application seeking to direct the plaintiff to undergo DNA test to establish his biological link with late Trilok Chand Gupta and late Sona Devi. The plaintiff objected to this and pointed out that he has produced adequate documentary evidence to support his claim. The trial court dismissed the application saying that the plaintiff cannot be compelled to undergo the test.
Challenging the trial court's dismissal, the defendants filed appeal before the High Court, which directed the plaintiff to undergo the DNA test. Against the High Court order, the plaintiff approached the Supreme Court.
Issues identified by the Supreme Court
The Supreme Court noted that the following issues arose in the case :
Whether in a declaratory suit where ownership over coparcenary property is claimed, the plaintiff, against his wishes, can be subjected to the DNA test.\
Whether the plaintiff without subjecting himself to a DNA test, is entitled to establish his right over the property in question, through other material evidence.
Whether in the absence of consent, a party can be forced to provide sample for a DNA test.
Considering the issues, the Court noted that it has been held in Banarsi Dass V. Teeku Dutta 2005(4) SCC 449 that DNA test is not to be directed as a matter of routine but only in deserving cases.
Later, in Dipanwita Roy vs. Ronobroto Roy (2015) 1 SCC 365, in a case related to alleged infidelity, the Court endorsed the view expressed in Banari Dass and added that adverse inference may be drawn against a party who refuses to undergo the DNA Test.
Possibility of stigmatizing a person to be considered
The judgment authored by Justice Hrishikesh Roy made the following significant observations :
"Keeping in mind the issue of burden of proof, it would be safe to conclude that in a case like the present, the Court's decision should be rendered only after balancing the interests of the parties, i.e, the quest for truth, and the social and cultural implications involved therein.
The  possibility of stigmatizing a person as a bastard, the ignominy that attaches to an adult who, in the mature years of his life is shown to be not the biological son of his parents may not only be a heavy cross to bear but would also intrude upon his right of privacy".
Issue of proportionality to be considered
"Whether a person can be compelled to provide a sample for DNA in such matters can also be answered considering the test of proportionality laid down in the unanimous decision of this Court in K.S Puttaswamy v. Union of India, wherein the right to privacy has been declared a constitutionally protected right in India.
The Court should therefore examine the proportionality of the legitimate aims being pursued, i.e whether the same are not arbitrary or discriminatory, whether they may have an adverse impact on the person and that they justify the encroachment upon the privacy and personal autonomy of the person, being subjected to the DNA Test".
Trial court correctly dismissed the application
The Supreme Court noted that the application was filed after the plaintiff had already adduced his evidence. When the turn for the defendant's evidence came, they sought to subject the plaintiff to DNA test.  Considering the timing of the application, the Court said that the trial court correctly dismissed it.
The plaintiff had produced SSLC certificate, domicile certificate to show his biological link with the parents of the defendants.
Respondent cannot force the plaintiff to produce additional evidence
"Therefore, the nature of further evidence to be adduced by the plaintiff (by providing DNA sample), need not be ordered by the Court at the instance of the other side. In such kind of litigation where the interest will have to be balanced and the test of eminent need is not satisfied our considered opinion is that the protection of the right to privacy of the Plaintiff should get precedence", the Court observed.
The Court said that the suit will have to be ultimately decided on the basis of the quality of evidence adduced by the plaintiff. He is conscious of the consequences of his refusal. The question of adverse inference may also arise in the trial. 
"The respondent cannot compel the plaintiff to adduce further evidence in support of the defendants' case. In any case, it is the burden on a litigating party to prove his case adducing evidence in support of his plea and the court should not compel the party to prove his case in the manner, suggested by the contesting party", the Supreme Court stressed.
"The Court is to weigh both side's evidence with all attendant circumstances and then reach a verdict in the Suit and this is not the kind of case where a DNA test of the plaintiff is without exception", the Court added.

Case Title : Ashok Kumar v. Raj Gupta and others | C.A No.6153/2021

The Supreme Court observed that the issue of limitation cannot be decided as preliminary issue under Order XIV Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure if it is not a pure question of law.Order XIV Rule 2(2) provides that if issues both of law and of fact arise in the same suit, and the Court is of opinion that the case or any part thereof may be disposed of on an issue of law only, it may try...
The Supreme Court observed that the issue of limitation cannot be decided as preliminary issue under Order XIV Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure if it is not a pure question of law.
Order XIV Rule 2(2) provides that if issues both of law and of fact arise in the same suit, and the Court is of opinion that the case or any part thereof may be disposed of on an issue of law only, it may try that issue first if that issue relates to- (a) the jurisdiction of the Court, or (b) a bar to the suit created by any law for the time being in-force.
In this case, the trial Court dismissed a suit on the ground of limitation which was taken as a preliminary issue. The Suit was filed by the plaintiff seeking recovery of an amount of Rs 1,11,63,633 together with interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of the institution of the suit till the realization of the full amount, from the defendant. The trial Judge held that the admission in paragraph 10 of the plaint is that the last payment was made on 20 June 2013 by the plaintiff and since the suit was instituted on 1 April 2017, three years nine months and ten days thereafter, it is barred by limitation. The High Court upheld this order.
Before the Apex court, the appellant contended that the suit which was instituted on 31 March 2017 is within limitation and that in any event, this is a matter which has to be tried on the basis of evidence and could not have been disposed of purely on the basis of oral arguments ; That there was an open and running current account between the parties.
Perusing the plaint, the Apex Court bench noted that the issue as to whether the claim of the plaintiff is barred by limitation cannot be isolated from the nature of the transactions between the parties.
"In any event, whether the plea of the appellant as set up in paragraph of the plaint is proved would depend upon evidence adduced at the trial. The course of action which was followed by the learned trial Judge of directing the parties to address arguments on the issue of limitation was irregular. The issue of limitation in the present case would require evidence to be adduced.", the court noted.
The court noted that Order XIV Rule 2 of the CPC specifies two questions of law, which are (i) jurisdiction of the Court; and (ii) a bar to the suit created by any law for the time being in force. Referring to observations made in Nusli Neville Wadia v. Ivory Properties (2020) 6 SCC 557, the court allowed the appeal by observing thus:
Since the determination of the issue of limitation in this case is not a pure question of law, it cannot be decided as preliminary issue under Order XIV Rule 2 of the CPC.

Form 16 issued by an employer for income tax purposes, showing a higher remuneration than a salary slip, is a reliable piece of evidence for compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act, the Bombay High Court has held.
 "We find that Form 16 is a reliable piece of evidence to determine the real income of the deceased. The reason is that Form 16 has been signed and generated by the employer of the deceased," a division bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Gauri Godse observed. 
 "Whenever a Tribunal or a Court fixes an amount of compensation in cases of accident, it involves some guess work some hypothetical consideration and certain amount of sympathy. Thus, the Tribunal ought to have considered the entries in Form 16, which showed the total income of the deceased," the bench added. 
  The bench ordered Tata AIG General Insurance Co Ltd to pay deceased Vilas Ramkumar Deshpande's kin Rs. 2,78,76,708 with 8% interest within four months for an accident on the Mumbai – Agra Highway in December 2012. At the time of the accident Deshpande was 46-years-old and a Senior Manager with Ultratech Cement Limited at Mumbai. 
 During the accident, a vehicle rammed into the divider, crossed over to the other side of the road and hit Deshpande's car killing him soon after. While the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal ordered compensation of Rs.1,76,08,400 in February 2018, it relied on the petitioner's salary slip and not Form 16. It observed that there could always be ups and downs in business and therefore, it wasn't right to consider income in addition to salary.
 Deshpande's wife, two minor children and ailing parents approached the High Court in appeal seeking enhancement of compensation. 
 Advocate Shrishank Chavanke for the family submitted that the Form 16 should be considered as its an official document submitted at the time of paying IT returns. In the Form 16, apart from the basic salary, there are several other heads which increases the annual income. He relied on a letter by the employer by which his salary was revised from July, 2012 for his exceptional performance. The administrative officer of the employer was also examined.
 Prabha Gupta, driving the offending vehicle didn't appear in court. However, Tata AIG resisted the claim on the ground that the letter didn't disclose that Deshpande was entitled to the same perks every year, therefore the tribunal rightly relied on the salary slip.
 At the outset the court held that Form 16 was a reliable piece of evidence, especially since the respondents were unable to demonstrated anything to the contrary. The tribunal finding that there were always ups and downs in the progress of business and therefore it would not be proper to consider the income of the deceased which was in addition to the salary, is not acceptable, the bench added.
 "The Tribunal has erred in taking into consideration only the income as shown in the salary slip. As stated hereinabove, evidence and documents produced on record shows that over and above the basic salary, the deceased was also entitled to an additional remuneration on account of his performance. Evidence on record also shows that the performance of the deceased was exceedingly well and thus there is no reason to disbelieve that the deceased would have been always entitled to additional remuneration. Thus, the total income of the deceased shown in Form 16 can be attributed to his earnings."
 But since this letter did not have the revised "cost to company," figures of income as reflected in Form 16 would be taken into consideration. The court noted that the appellant's calculations were accurate based on the guidelines in National Insurance Company Limited v Pranay Sethi. 
 As stated hereinabove, evidence and documents produced on record shows that over and above the basic salary, the deceased was also entitled to an additional remuneration on account of his performance.
Case Title: Anjali Vilas Deshpande versus Prabha Rajendra Gupta

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently dismissed an appeal preferred by a woman against the judgment and decree of the Family Court whereby her husband's petition seeking dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce had been allowed and he had been granted a divorce.
The Bench of Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Ashok Kumar Verma noted that in the instant case, enough mental cruelty had been caused to the husband by the acts of the wife, and thus, the Court went on to dismiss her appeal.
The case in brief
The marriage of appellant-wife (Harbans Kaur) was solemnized with respondent-Husband (Joginder Pal) in December 1992. In May 2011, the appellant-wife filed a petition under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, and the same was dismissed. Appeal against the said order was also dismissed.
The Appellant-wife also got registered an FIR under Sections 323, 325, 506, and 34 IPC against the respondent-husband but in that case, he was acquitted. 
In his petition seeking a divorce, the Husband stated that the wife had tried to take forcible possession of the agricultural land owned and possessed by him, and presently, a civil suit against the appellant is pending in District Courts, Karnal. 
It was further alleged that the appellant-wife was living in adultery with some person in the year 2012 and she forcibly turned out the respondent along with his four children from the house. 
Since then, the husband has been living in a rented house and no cohabitation had taken place between them. Further, when the marriage of their daughter was fixed by the respondent-husband, he requested the wife to join the marriage but she taunted that she had no concern with the respondent and his children. 
Against this backdrop, the divorce petition was filed by the Husband.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court noted that the Supreme Court had held that even one complaint lodged by the wife found to be false against the husband and his family members amounted to cruelty. 
"Even if husband and wife are staying together and husband does not speak to the wife, it would cause mental cruelty and a spouse staying away by sending vulgar and defamatory letters or notices or filing complaints containing indecent allegations or by initiating number of judicial proceedings can make the life of other spouse miserable," the Court added.
Further, the Court, taking into account the facts of the case, noted that after the acquittal in the FIR and dismissal of the domestic violence complaint against the Husband, it could be said that enough mental cruelty had been caused to him. Consequently, the wife's appeal was dismissed.
Case title: Harbans Kaur v. Joginder Pal [FAO-M-272 of 2017]

The Supreme Court has held that a complaint filed on behalf of a company under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is not liable to be dismissed for the sole reason that it stated the name of the Managing Director first followed by the company's name.A bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundersh held that though this format may not be perfect it cannot be...
The Supreme Court has held that a complaint filed on behalf of a company under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is not liable to be dismissed for the sole reason that it stated the name of the Managing Director first followed by the company's name.
A bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundersh held that though this format may not be perfect it cannot be termed defective.
"There could be a format where the Company's name is described first, suing through the Managing Director but there cannot be a fundamental defect merely because the name of the Managing Director is stated first followed by the post held in the Company", the bench observed in the order.
In this case, the subject cheques were issued in favour of  a company named M/s. Bell Marshall Telesystems Limited. The complaint was filed with the following description of the complainant : "Mr. Bhupesh M. Rathod, Managing Director of M/s. Bell Marshall Telesystems Ltd......". 
The complaint was accompanied with a copy of the board resolution which authorized the Managing Director to file the complaint.
The accused, among other things, objected to the complaint on the ground that it was filed in the personal capacity of Bhupesh Rathod and not on behalf of the company. 
The trial court acquitted the accused holding that there was no document to show the loan being granted and that the board resolution was not signed. The complainant filed appeal before the High Court.
The High Court dismissed the appeal observing that the complaint was not filed on behalf of the company and that the complainant was not the payee of the cheque.
Supreme Court's analysis
At the outset, the Court noted that the respondent, having admitted the signatures of the cheque, had to discharge the burden of proving that the transaction was not covered under Section 138 NI Act.  Other than taking a technical objection, really nothing has been said on the substantive aspect.
As regards the principles governing the filing of a complaint by a corporate entity, the bench referred to the precedent in Associated Cement Co. Ltd. v. Keshavanand (2002) 1 SCC 234. The body corporate will be the de jure complainant but the human agent representing it will be the de facto complainant.
"...no Magistrate could insist that the particular person whose statement was taken on oath alone can continue to represent the Company till the end of the proceedings. Not only that, even if there was initially no authority the Company can at any stage rectify that defect by sending a competent person", the Court said in the judgment.
Looking at the format of the complaint, the Court said that it was apparent that the Managing Director has filed it on behalf of the company.
"The description of the complainant with its full registered office address is given at the inception itself except that the Managing Director's name appears first as acting on behalf of the Company. The affidavit and the cross-examination in respect of the same during trial supports the finding that the complaint had been filed by the Managing Director on behalf of the Company. Thus, the format itself cannot be said to be defective though it may not be perfect. The body of the complaint need not be required to contain anything more in view of what has been set out at the inception coupled with the copy of the Board Resolution. There is no reason to otherwise annex a copy of the Board Resolution if the complaint was not being filed by the appellant on behalf of the Company",  the Court observed in this regard.
To technical a view to defeat a complain merely because the body of the complaint does not elaborate upon the authorization.
The Court further noted that a copy of the Board Resolution was filed along with the complaint. 
"A Manager or a Managing Director ordinarily by the very nomenclature can be taken to be the person in-charge of the affairs Company for its day-to-day management and within the activity would certainly be calling the act of approaching the court either under civil law or criminal law for setting the trial in motion.  It would be too technical a view to take to defeat the complaint merely because the body of the complaint does not elaborate upon the authorisation. The artificial person being the Company had to act through a person/official, which logically would include the Chairman or Managing Director. Only the existence of authorisation could be verified"
The Supreme Court reversed the judgments of the High Court and the Magistrate. On facts, the Court held that the respondent was liable to be convicted for the offence under Section 138 NI Act. The Court held that the respondent should be sentenced with imprisonment for a term of one year and with fine twice the amount of the cheque, i.e., Rs.3,20,000/-.
"However, in view of passage of time, we provide that if the respondent pays a further sum of Rs.1,60,000/- to the appellant, then the sentence would stand suspended. The needful be done by the respondent within two (2) months from today. The appellant would also be entitled to costs", the bench added.

Coram : Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundersh

The Allahabad High Court has restrained the UP Government, block-level officers, and various other departments from passing any orders for the engagement of Anganwadi Workers in any other work/duty including election duty.
"...this Court is of the considered view that work which is being discharged by Anganwadi Workers is of considerable importance, looking into the fact that in one block there is only one worker and in case that one Anganwadi Worker is assigned duty in elections or any other work then entire nursing and lactating woman including pregnant women would not be taken care of and would adversely affect the health of public at large," the Bench of Justice Alok Mathur observed
Further, the Court directed that the copy its order be served upon the Chief Secretary, Government of U.P., Lucknow so that appropriate instructions could be given to the District Magistrates of the State.
Essentially, the Court was hearing a writ plea filed by Manisha Kanojia and another, who are working as Anganwadi Workers in the Barabanki district and who were deputed by the administration on the duty of Booth Level Officer (BLO) in the local body elections. 
Challenging the same, they moved the Court arguing that their deputation on the poll duty was against the orders and instructions of the Central and State Governments as the same would affect the health care of children and mothers in the area. The petitioners also argued that other village-level personnel could be engaged in the election work.
A categorical direction was sought from the Court to the official authorities to comply with the order of the Chief Secretary, Government of U.P. dated 19.11.2019 and 03.05.2017, as well as Government Order, dated 09.11.2013, which restrains Anganwadi Workers/Helpers to be engaged in non Integrated Child Development Services Schemes (I.C.D.S.) related tasks
In view of these submissions and acknowledging the importance of work rendered by the Anganwadi workers, the Court allowed the writ petition and directed the block-level officers and various other departments to restrain themselves from passing any orders engaging Anganwadi Workers in any other work/duty including election duty and to comply with Government Order dated 19.11.2019 and 03.05.2017 as well as Government Order dated 09.11.2013.
Case title - Smt. Manisha Kanaujia And Another v. District Magistrate And Another [WRIT - A No. - 6428 of 2022]

The Gujarat High Court has recently dismissed the writ petition of a Pakistani citizen challenging the decision of the Superintendent of Police which directed him to leave India within 24 hours of receipt of the notice.

The Gujarat High Court has recently dismissed the writ petition of a Pakistani citizen challenging the decision of the Superintendent of Police which directed him to leave India within 24 hours of receipt of the notice. Justice AS Supehia also reiterated:
 "In the present case, indubitably, the petitioner is a Pakistan citizen and as per the law enunciated by the Apex Court, he cannot invoke Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution of India, hence, he has no right to enter and remain within the territories of India. He is bound to the act, as per the order dated 14.07.2022 passed by the respondent authorities."
 The Petitioner had claimed that he was born and brought up in India and was married to an Indian citizen and thus entitled to citizenship under Section 5(1)(c) of the Indian Citizenship Act. He challenged the decision of the authorities on the ground that it violated the principles of natural justice.
 The ASG contested that the Petitioner has been living in India for almost 40 years without legal permission and authority. It was submitted that in a civil suit filed earlier by the Petitioner was partly decreed and respondent authorities were restrained from deporting the petitioner till the decision of the Central Government under Section 9 of the Citizenship Act. However, this order was set aside by the appellate court. The said judgment was not challenged by the petitioner and nothing is produced on record showing that the same is challenged before any higher forum. Thus, he argued that the instant petition was not maintainable under Article 14 and 19 of the Constitution.
At the outset, the High Court observed that the Petitioner had filed an application for claiming citizenship only on 16.07.2022.
However, it noted that the present writ petition challenging the impugned order of Police Superintendent itself is misconceived since the impugned order is premised on the order passed in abovementioned appellate proceedings, that were not challenged by the Petitioner.
"In the present case, unquestionably, the petitioner has not challenged the aforesaid order by filing an appeal and since the impugned order dated 14.07.2022 is premised on the said order dated 12.07.2022 passed in the Regular Civil Appeal, the petitioner cannot contend that he has right to be heard before passing the order since such right would get diluted in view of the order passed by the Court of Principal District Judge, Panchmahals at Godhara," the Court held.
It added that the Petitioner is indubitably a Pakistan citizen and as per the law enunciated by the Apex Court, he cannot invoke Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution of India, hence, he has no right to enter and remain within the territories of India. He is bound to the act as per the order passed by the respondent authorities, it added.
Accordingly, the petition was dismissed.
 Case No.: C/SCA/13566/2022
 Case Title: AKIL VALIBHAI PIPLODWALA (LOKHANDWALA) v/s DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE, PANCHAMAHAL AT GODHRA

Observing that electricity is an essential service, the Delhi High Court has said that a person cannot be deprived of it without a cogent and lawful reason. 
Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri in a judgment passed on Monday said that it is well-settled that even if disputes exist regarding the ownership of a property at which an electricity connection is sought, the concerned authorities cannot deprive the legal occupant of the same by insisting that a no objection certificate (NOC) be furnished from others, who also claim to be owners. 
Reliance was placed on a recent Supreme Court ruling in Dilip (Dead) through Lrs. v. Satish & Others wherein it was held that electricity cannot be declined to a tenant on the ground of failure or refusal of the landlord to issue NOC. It was also said by the Supreme Court that all that the electricity supply authority is required to examine is whether the applicant for electricity connection is in occupation of the premises in question.
The court was dealing with a plea filed by a couple, who are senior citizens, seeking installation of a fresh electricity meter at their premises without insisting for NOC from the husband's three brothers. The parties are engaged in a partition suit with respect to the subject property.
It was submitted on behalf of the petitioners that while electricity was granted to two of the respondents without insisting on NOC from the petitioners, the latter have been denied the same for want of NOC from the former.
"Presently, the electricity supply to the portion occupied by petitioners in the subject premises is received as per inter se arrangement, however the same has led to multiple disputes between the parties," the court was told.
The petitioners undertook to comply with all the codal and commercial formalities of BSES and submitted that there are no outstanding dues with respect to electricity connection installed at the subject premises.
On the other hand, the counsel appearing for BSES submitted that the petitioners' request for a new electricity connection was not acceded to in view of the objections raised by the brothers. The court was apprised, on instructions, that there are no pending dues with respect to electricity connection installed at the subject premises.
Following court's observation that supply of electricity cannot be denied to the petitioners, the BSES counsel said that their application for fresh electricity connection would be considered in accordance with law without insisting on NOC from the brothers.
"Respondent No.2 shall process the petitioners' application for providing fresh electricity connection forthwith without insisting on NOC from respondent Nos.3 to 5 within two weeks from the date of filing of the application," said the court.
The court also directed the petitioners to pay the consumption charges in accordance with the bills raised by BSES from time to time or till the time they occupy the subject premises.
"Respondent No.2 shall be entitled to disconnect the electricity supply at the subject premises in case petitioners fail to pay the electricity charges. Application of the petitioners shall be processed and electricity connection shall be installed within two working days of the petitioners completing all the formalities," the court added. 
Title: SUDHARSHAN KUMAR SHARMA AND ANR. v. STATE OF NCT OF DELHI AND ORS.

The Rajasthan High Court has allowed a joint application filed by the petitioner-wife and the respondent-husband for waiver of six months cooling off period prescribed under Section 13-B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for divorce by mutual consent. Justice Dinesh Mehta, observed,"In light of the facts and circumstances of the case, particularly the fact that the parties...
The Rajasthan High Court has allowed a joint application filed by the petitioner-wife and the respondent-husband for waiver of six months cooling off period prescribed under Section 13-B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for divorce by mutual consent.
 Justice Dinesh Mehta, observed,
"In light of the facts and circumstances of the case, particularly the fact that the parties are sufficiently educated and are aware of their rights...as they have mutually decided to end their matrimony finding no hope/chance of reconciliation, I am of the opinion that their application for waiver of the statutory period of six months specified under Section 13-B(2) of the Act of 1955 deserves acceptance."
The parties had approached the court after being aggrieved with the order passed by the Family Court, Bhilwara, which on 16 Dec, 2021 dismissed the aforesaid prayer of the parties. 
Essentially, marriage of the parties was solemnised as per Hindu customs on 25.11.2003 in Mandalgarh, Bhilwara. Soon after the marriage, their relations became strained and since the last four years, both have been residing separately. Thereafter, best efforts were made to restore conjugal relations and in spite of regular counselling by their near relatives, the matrimonial dispute between them could not be settled.
 As a result, parties jointly filed a divorce application in Family Court by mutual consent, which in turn registered the said application and fixed the next date as 20 Jan, 2022 for counselling.
 The counsels for the parties submitted that the decision by the parties to end their marriage has not been taken in a hurry and reconciliation between the parties is highly unlikely.
It may be noted that Section 13B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act contains a bar to divorce being granted before six months of the time elapsing after filing of the divorce petition by mutual consent.
The High Court opined that the petition of the parties deserves to be accepted as the parties are sufficiently educated and are aware of their rights – the respondent (husband) is running a shop also. In this regard, the court also observes that parties have mutually decided to end their matrimonial relation after finding no hope/chance of reconciliation.
 The order was issued by the court in exercise of its extraordinary powers available by virtue of Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
The court relied on the conditions set out in the case of Amardeep Singh v. Harveen Kaur, where the Apex Court held that the period under Section 13-B(2) is not mandatory but directory. The Apex Court added that it will be open to the Court to exercise its discretion in the facts and circumstances of each case where there is no possibility of parties resuming cohabitation and where there are chances of alternative rehabilitation.
 The court directed the parties to appear before Family Court on 20 Jan, 2022, whereafter the concerned Family Court will pass a decree of divorce in accordance with law.

The Supreme Court has discussed the differences between 'furlough' and 'parole' and the principles relating to grant of them.
A bench comprising Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice BV Nagarathna stated the broad principles as :
(i)	Furlough and parole envisage a short-term temporary release from custody;
(ii)	While parole is granted for the prisoner to meet a specific exigency, furlough may be granted after a stipulated number of years have been served without any reason;
(iii)	The grant of furlough is to break the monotony of imprisonment and to enable the convict to maintain continuity with family life and integration with society;
(iv)	Although furlough can be claimed without a reason, the prisoner does not have an absolute legal right to claim furlough;
(v)	The grant of furlough must be balanced against the public interest and can be refused to certain categories of prisoners.
Referring to various precedents, the bench also observed that balance needs to be maintained between two competing interests while granting parole or furlough- that of reforming the convict on one hand and the public purpose and interests of society on the other: 
The bench was deciding an appeal filed by the State of Gujarat against a judgment of the Gujarat High Court which granted two weeks' furlough to self-proclaimed godman and rape convict Asaram's son Narayan Sai who is also serving life term in a 2014 rape case. The convict had approached the High Court after the DGP rejected his application for furlough.
Furlough not a matter of right
Referring to the provisions of the Bombay Furlough and Parole Rules, the bench noted that the Rules do not confer a legal right on a prisoner to be released on furlough. The grant of furlough is regulated by Rule 3 and Rule 4. While Rule 3 provides the eligibility criteria for grant of furlough for prisoners serving different lengths of imprisonment, Rule 4 imposes limitations. The use of the expression "may be released" in Rule 3 indicates the absence of an absolute right. This is further emphasised in Rule 17 which states that said Rules do not confer a legal right on a prisoner to claim release on furlough.  
The Court further noted that the the Jail Superintendent has given a negative opinion based on the fact that the respondent kept a mobile phone inside the jail illegally and attempted to make contacts with the outside world.
Setting aside the High Court order, the judgment authored by Justice Chandrachud stated :
"The order dated 8 May 2021 has adduced a number of circumstances which cumulatively indicate that the release of the respondent on furlough may lead to a violation of public peace. The order refers specifically to the threat he and his followers pose to the complainant and other persons who deposed at the trial. An attempt has been made to threaten and suborn the investigating team and the witnesses. The respondent and his father have a mass following of persons who owe loyalty to them and there is a reasonable apprehension of a disruption of public peace and tranquillity. During the trial, attempts have been made to bribe public officials. The conduct after the trial, in jail, has not been shown to be above reproach. The respondent was released earlier this year to accommodate a genuine need to attend to his mother's health at the relevant time. Based on this, we are unable to agree with the line of reasoning of the High Court"

The Supreme Court observed that demand of money for construction of a house is a 'dowry demand' to attract offence under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code.The word "Dowry" ought to be ascribed an expansive meaning so as to encompass any demand made on a woman, whether in respect of a property or a valuable security of any nature, the bench of CJI NV Ramana, Justice AS Bopanna and Hima...
The Supreme Court observed that demand of money for construction of a house is a 'dowry demand' to attract offence under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code.
The word "Dowry" ought to be ascribed an expansive meaning so as to encompass any demand made on a woman, whether in respect of a property or a valuable security of any nature, the bench of CJI NV Ramana, Justice AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli said.
In this case, the Trial Court convicted  husband and father-in-law of the deceased under Sections 304-B, 306 and 498-A IPC. It was found that the accused had been demanding money from the deceased for constructing a house which her family members were unable to give and as a result, she was constantly harassed and subjected to cruelty, finally leading to her committing suicide. In appeal, the High Court held that held that the demand of money for construction of a house cannot be treated as a demand for dowry. The court observed that the offence under Section 304-B was not established against them as the demand allegedly made on the deceased was for money to construct a house, which cannot be treated as a dowry demand for connecting her death to the said cause. 
The Apex Court bench, in its judgment delivered appeal filed by the State, listed four pre-requisites for convicting an accused for the offence punishable under Section 304- B as follows:
 (i) that the death of a woman must have been caused by burns or bodily injury or occurred otherwise than under normal circumstance; (ii) that such a death must have occurred within a period of seven years of her marriage; (iii) that the woman must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment at the hands of her husband, soon before her death; and (iv) that such a cruelty or harassment must have been for or related to any demand for dowry
Disagreeing with the view adopted by the High Court, the bench observed:
"13. The Latin maxim "Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat" i.e, a liberal construction should be put up on written instruments, so as to uphold them, if possible, and carry into effect, the intention of the parties, sums it up. Interpretation of a provision of law that will defeat the very intention of the legislature must be shunned in favour of an interpretation that will promote the object sought to be achieved through the legislation meant to uproot a social evil like dowry demand. In this context the word "Dowry" ought to be ascribed an expansive meaning so as to encompass any demand made on a woman, whether in respect of a property or a valuable security of any nature. When dealing with cases under Section 304-B IPC, a provision legislated to act as a deterrent in the society and curb the heinous crime of dowry demands, the shift in the approach of the courts ought to be from strict to liberal, from constricted to dilated. Any rigid meaning would tend to bring to naught, the real object of the provision. Therefore, a push in the right direction is required to accomplish the task of eradicating this evil which has become deeply entrenched in our society"
The bench said that the trial Court has correctly interpreted the demand for money raised by the respondents on the deceased for construction of a house as falling within the definition of the word "dowry". 
"The submission made by learned counsel for the respondents that the deceased was also a party to such a demand as she had on her own asked her mother and maternal uncle to contribute to the construction of the house, must be understood in the correct perspective. It cannot be lost sight of that the respondents had been constantly tormenting the deceased and asking her to approach her family members for money to build a house and it was only on their persistence and insistence that she was compelled to ask them to contribute some amount for constructing a house. The Court must be sensitive to the social milieu from which the parties hail.", the court said.
Holding thus, the bench restored the conviction of the accused under Section 304B IPC.
Case name: State of Madhya Pradesh vs Jogendra
Case no. : CrA 190 OF 2012 | 11 Jan 2022
Coram: CJI NV Ramana, Justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli

The Madras High Court on Tuesday rejected a review application filed by Thol. Thirumavalavan, leader of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, seeking a review of the September 22nd order passed by the court granting permission to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to conduct their route march.
The bench of Justice GK Ilanthiraiyan observed that the petitioner was not a party to the Writ Petitions and if he had any grievances over the order, he could very well file an appeal in the manner known to law.
The grounds raised by the petitioner are applicable only to challenge the order passed by this Court and not for review, since there is no apparent error on the face of records as such the petitioner failed to make any ground to review the order passed by this Court. Considering the above facts and circumstances, this Court finds no merits in the Review Application to review the order dated 22.09.2022 passed by this Court in W.P.No.24540 of 2022 etc., batch. Hence, the present petition to grant leave to file Review application is liable to be dismissed.
The petitioner apprehended that if given permission to conduct the route march, the organisation would disrupt law and order & public order. He also submitted that his party had invited general public to participate in a social harmony procession on the same day. Thus, if the respondent organisation was allowed to conduct their procession, there will be a public disruption. The petitioner also contended that the Registry had erroneously numbered the petitions as criminal when the relief sought was of civil nature. 
The court relied on the decision of the Apex Court in Ram Kishan Fauji Vs. State of Haryana and ors, where the court explained what constitutes criminal proceedings includes those in which in the larger interest of the State, orders to prevent apprehended breach of the peace, orders to bind down persons who are a danger to the maintenance of peace and order or orders aimed at preventing vagrancy. Therefore, the registry was right in numbering the petitions as criminal. 
The court also pointed out that just because the petitioner had also sought permission to conduct procession on the same day, it did not give him any right to seek review of the order of the court. The court noted that the present litigation was nothing but an abuse of process of law.
Thus, noting that the petitioner had no locus standi and that there were no valid grounds for review, the court dismissed the petition.

The Kerala High Court on Thursday held that testimony alone, of an interested party seeking exemption under Section 3(2) of Kerala Private Forest (Vesting and Assignments) Act, 1971, is not sufficient to establish that the disputed property was cultivated during a particular time.
The Act prescribes that the ownership and possession of all private forests in the state of Kerala shall stand transferred to and be vested in the Government. Section 3(2) however is an exemption clause for land comprised in private forests held by an owner under his personal cultivation.
A Division Bench consisting of Justice K. Vinod Chandran and Justice C. Jayachandran observed that grant of exemption under Section 3(2) of the Act taking stock of the applicant's case/claim only, without referring to any evidence in support thereof, is perverse and unsustainable in law.
"Adequate evidence could have been adduced by examining a labourer, who had performed some work in the subject property, in connection with the cultivation claimed. Evidence could also have been led in the form of any agricultural income tax paid or such other records indicating cultivation..."
The Court also made it clear that the state of affairs as on the cut off date should indicate, by the yardstick of preponderance of probability, that the land in question was in the cultivation of the applicant; however, the scope and ambit of the expression 'cultivation' as employed in Section 3(2) of the Act is not the same as 'spontaneous/natural growth'.
It held,
"The term 'cultivation' implies a systematic agricultural or farming activity, including tilling of the soil, sowing seeds of the particular crop, nurturing the same by supplying water, fertilizers, if any, required etc., until the crops are grown to such extent, so as to reap the produce. In the context of evidence, materials in individual support of the above facets of cultivation may not be possible/feasible."
The Court was dealing with State's appeal against an order passed by Forest Tribunal, Kozhikode which though held that the disputed property is a private forest, which vests with the Government, but also granted exemption in favour of the Respondent (original applicant) under Section 3(2) of the Act.
Special Government Pleader (Forest), Advocate Nagaraj Narayanan, averred that the impugned order is a non-speaking one and no reason other than a bald statement that the father of the respondent was cultivating in the property was given in the order. He further relied on a number of Kerala High Court decisions to contend that the burden of proof is on the respondent to prove that the cultivation in the subject property was produced by the applicant.
On the contrary, the Counsel appearing for the respondent, Advocate Mohanakannan, pointed out that there was a specific pleading in the Original Application regarding the cultivation made by the applicant's father after purchasing the disputed property in 1961.
It is shocking to note, remarked the Court, as no reason is stated in the impugned order to find the applicant is entitled to the exemption under Section 3(2) of the Act. 
After considering the contentions raised by Counsels and pursuing the impugned order, the Court sided with the contentions raised by the Special Government Pleader that granting an exemption under Section 3(2) of the Act relying on just the claim made by the applicant without referring to any evidence is unsustainable in law.
We find that the grant of exemption under Section 3(2) of the Act taking stock of the applicant's case/claim only, without referring to any evidence in support thereof, is perverse and unsustainable in law.
In the instant case, the Court observed that the spontaneous/ natural growth of 6 to 7 tamarind trees or 3 chadachikora trees doesn't fulfil the requirement provided under the Act to hold that the land in question was held by the applicant as the owner under his personal cultivation. 
Furthermore, the Court observed that for a claim under Section 3(3) of the Act, the intention for cultivation is relevant with respect to the time of purchase/transfer of the property by virtue of a registered deed.
Such intention to cultivate harbored by the purchaser/assignee/lessee should be translated into action within a reasonable time from the date of execution of the registered deed and some acts in furtherance of cultivation should have been done, observed the Court. 
On facts, the Court observed that since the applicant failed to establish any cultivation on the disputed property, then in such circumstance, any intention of the applicant's father in the year 1961 to cultivate the property would pale into significance, in consideration with the fact that no act in furtherance of such intention is established in evidence. 
Furthermore, the requirement under Section 3(1) of the Act, for holding the property under a valid registered document is not satisfied as per section 3(1) of the MPPF Act, alienation of a private forest by way of sale, mortgage, lease or otherwise without the previous sanction of the District Collector is null and void. here the applicant has no case that the disputed property was purchased with sanction of the District Collector. 
The Court thereby allowed the appeal, setting aside the impugned order.

A recent order of the Gujarat High Court upholding the acquittal of a man under Section 135 of the Electricity Act for alleged unlicensed connection has made it clear that ownership/ possession of the property in question has to be factored into consideration.
Justice Ashokkumar Joshi rejected the State's appeal on several grounds, including the fact that the Police did not call for any certificate or documents to show the possession or ownership of accused for the so-called place of occurrence.
It held that the order of the trial court has meticulously considered all the depositions of the witnesses, the State had failed to prove the case against the Respondent-Accused and the trial court's order did not warrant any interference.
"While exercising the powers in appeal against the order of acquittal, the Court of appeal would not ordinarily interfere with the order of acquittal unless the approach of the lower Court is vitiated by some manifest illegality and the conclusion arrive at would not be arrived at by any reasonable person."
A complaint was lodged by the Deputy Engineer of the South Gujarat Vij Company Ltd accusing the Respondent of theft of electricity. Allegedly, the Applicant did not have a regular connection and he had obtained illegal direct connection from low transmission line. It was alleged that an average bill of Rs. 2 lacs was prepared and issued to the Accused which was not paid by him and accordingly, the instant complaint was filed.
 The APP opposed trial court's order by relying on the deposition of several witnesses who were said to be 'reliable and trustworthy' and other documentary evidence. 
Per contra, the Respondent argued that it was not proved by the Prosecution that the ownership of the premises belonged to the Accused. Therefore, there was no need to interfere with the judgement order.
 Justice Joshi noted that the lineman at the respective time was cross-examined and had admitted that he had no knowledge of the number of persons who were residing at the place. The captioned wire which was confiscated was easily available in the market and did not contain any piece of marking paper. Further, there was no open wire/PVC wiring at the residential place of the Accused person. The Panch Witness also admitted that theft was not possible through the captioned wires. Another Panch Witness had turned hostile. 
The In-Charge PSO at the Police Station also admitted that he merely registered the offence and had done 'nothing' except for this. Significantly, there was also no evidence for the possession or ownership of the place of occurrence by the Accused. 
Thus, the bench dismissed State's appeal.

The Kerala High Court on Tuesday held that the District Court has the jurisdiction to execute an arbitral award and the commercial court has not been conferred such jurisdiction under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
A single bench of Justice C S Dias evaluated the scheme of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 to answer whether a commercial court was given jurisdiction to entertain an execution petition filed in connection with an arbitration award:
“Going by the scheme of the C.C. Act, the express exclusion of suits and applications reserved for judgment from the purview of transfer and the conscious omission of the provisions relating to execution proceedings under the Code of Civil Procedure in the schedule to the C.C. Act, urges me to agree and endorse the ratio decidendi in Shaji Augustine (supra), that applications mentioned in Section 15 of the C.C. Act do not include execution applications.” 
The court relied on Shaji Augustine v. M/s. Chithra Woods Manors Welfare Association [2021 SCC Online Ker. 9840]  where it was observed that the procedure to be followed for execution of an arbitration award was not mentioned anywhere in the Commercial Courts Act and there was nothing to indicate that the jurisdiction of other courts had been excluded. 
The court also analysed Section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 to infer that after the establishment of commercial courts, applications under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, pertaining to commercial disputes with a specified value, pending before a Civil Court were to be transferred to Commercial Courts. However, this does not include suits and applications already reserved for final judgment by the civil court prior to establishment of Commercial Courts and also execution petitions, the court pointed out
In the matter at hand, a sole Arbitrator had passed an award, for which the decree holder filed for execution before the District Court, Ernakulam. However, the District Judge transferred the petition to the Commercial Court under Section 15 of the Act. The jurisdiction of the Commercial Court was challenged by the petitioner. However, the Commercial Court was of the view that it had a vested right to execute arbitral awards. The said order of the Commercial Court was challenged by the petitioner. 
The court observed that, the execution petition was filed in the District Court, after Commercial Courts were established in Kerala by way of the Act. Hence, it was a freshly filed petition and not a matter pending before the District Court. Hence, the invocation of Section 15 of the Act by the District Court is violative of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, the court observed. The court also observed Section 15 of Act does not bring within its purview execution petitions. 
“Thus, if a more expansive interpretation is given to the word application falling under Section 15 of the C.C. Act, to include execution petitions also, then necessarily all the execution petitions pending before all the civil courts falling within the ken of the C.C. Act will have to be transferred to the Commercial Courts, which in turn will clog the special courts with such matters. Moreover, no practical purpose will be served by such transfer because the Special Courts are not conferred with any additional power than that of the Civil Courts, to speed track execution proceedings, as execution proceedings have been omitted in the schedule attached to the C.C. Act. Without a faster timeline provided under the C.C.Act, to enforce an award, it is immaterial whether the award is executed by the Civil Court or the Commercial Court.” 
The court was of opinion that the District Court erred in transferring the matter to the Commercial Court and ordered the matter to be transferred back to the District Court, Ernakulam.

Case Title: M/S. Beta Exim Logistics (P) Ltd. V M/S. Central Railside Warehouse Co., Ltd. 

A person holding a season ticket is a bonafide "passenger," for the purpose of claiming compensation under the Railway Act 1989 even in the absence of an identity card, the Bombay High Court has held.
 The Court said that the Ministry's instructions to consider a passenger who failed to produce an ID card along with his season ticket a ticketless traveller, were not mandatory. 
 Justice Sandeep K Shinde thus set aside an order of the Railways Claims Tribunal dated 17th March, 2009, and directed the Railway Claims Tribunal to grant the appellant, who fell of the train 18 years ago, Rs. 3 lakh compensation after verifying medical evidence. 
 The appellant, Harish Damodar said he had fallen from the train on January 25, 2004, around 5 pm, at Dadar station due to heavy rush. Subsequently, he underwent six surgeries to his spine and pelvis at Sion Hospital. He claimed compensation of Rs. 4 lakhs. 
 The tribunal rejected his claim on two counts:
First, that Damodar was not a "bonafide passenger", despite carrying a valid 'Pass' (season ticket) and journey extension tickets because in the absence of an identity card, season ticket could not have been held valid, therefore he was a ticketless traveller. 
 Second, that he had suffered due to his own negligence as the Station Master's memo claimed he was hit by a train while at the edge of the platform. Therefore, there was no "untoward incident" within the meaning of Section 123(c) of the Act of 1989. 
 The appellant assailed this order before the Bombay High Court. The Railways relied on certain instructions from the Ministry according to which production of an ID card along with the season ticket was mandatory, failing which a commuter would be treated as a ticketless traveller.
 However, Justice Shinde said that the instructions cannot be said to be mandatory, therefore the seasoned ticket was not invalid. Therefore, unless the passenger was using a season ticket issued in someone else's name, a proper season ticket without an identity card, ipso-facto, would not render season ticket invalid or the passenger a ticketless traveller. 
 Regarding observations about the passenger's "self-inflicted injuries", the High Court found the Station Master's testimony to be hearsay as he hadn't seen the accident first hand and claimed that an unknown person had informed him about Damodar being hit by a train. 
 "In view of these facts and evidence on record, the finding recorded by the Tribunal, that appellant had not sustained injuries in "untoward incident", but suffered "self-inflicted injuries", is erroneous and therefore quashed and set aside."
 The High Court directed the man to appear before the tribunal on June 10 and a decision on the compensation to be taken by July 31, 2022.

The Allahabad High Court recently imposed ₹20,000 Cost on a Dowry Death Accused after noting that she misused the process of law by filing successive applications before the Court suppressing the material facts and documents and had misled the Court.
The Bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar Singh further stressed that honesty, fairness, purity of mind should be of the highest order to approach the court, failing which the litigant should be shown the exit door at the earliest point of time.
The case in brief 
Essentially, One Smt. Ramendri had approached the Court by filing a 482 CrPC application praying for quashing of entire proceedings of a case registered against her [in connection with the alleged suicidal death of her daughter in law] under Section 498-A, 304-B IPC, and ¾ of Dowry Prohibition Act pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bulandshahr.
During the course of the hearing, a preliminary objection was raised by the counsel for the opposite party that the applicant had not approached the Court with clean hands and rather, she had filed successive applications by concealing the material facts and documents.
It was further submitted before the Court that after lodging of the FIR in the case, the applicant had approached the Allahabad High Court by way of filing an Anticipatory Bail plea, however, the same was disposed of in December 2020, directing her to surrender before the court below within three months and till then, interim protection was granted to her.
However, during the operation of the aforementioned order, she filed the instant application under Section 482 Cr. P.C in Feb 2021 sought quashing of the entire proceedings of the aforesaid case concealing the aforesaid order of the HC in her anticipatory bail plea.
Meanwhile, the applicant also challenged the December 2020 order of the HC before the Supreme Court, however, the appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court in July 2021, directing her to surrender within two days before the trial court in compliance with the order of the High Court.
However, she did not comply with the order of the Supreme Court as well as the High Court.
Further, during the pendency of the instant application, a non-bailable warrant was issued against her in April 2021, the legality thereof was challenged by her by filing another application under Section 482 Cr.P.C.through another advocate.
In this plea as well, there was no disclosure of the order of the HC and the SC. That application was disposed of in Feb 2022 directing the applicant to appear and surrender before the court below within two weeks, now this order was also not brought to the notice of the Court during the argument.
Court's order
Taking into account the background of the case, the Court, at the outset, observed that the applicant has no respect to the orders of the Supreme Court as well as the High Court Court. 
Furthermore, the Court added that she has not approached this Court with a clean hand and filed this application suppressing the material facts in sheer disobedience of the orders of Supreme Court as well as the High Court and therefore, she does not deserve any indulgence by this Court.
Against this backdrop, the Court also stressed as to how the process of the court is abused by unscrupulous litigants to achieve their nefarious design. The Court further remarked thus:
"I have no hesitation in saying that a person, whose case is based on falsehood, has no right to approach the court. He/she can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the litigation. The judicial process cannot become an instrument of oppression or abuse or a means in the process of the Court to subvert justice, for the reason that the Court exercises its jurisdiction, only in furtherance of justice."
In view of this, the application was rejected with costs, which was quantified at Rs. 25,000/- (rupees twenty-five thousand only) to be deposited by the applicant within 1 month with the Registrar General of the Court, failing which, the Court directed that the same shall be recovered from the applicant as arrears of land revenue.
The Registrar General was directed to forward the same to the account of Rajkiya Bal Greh Shishu, Allahabad so that the amount could be used for the welfare of the children.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has observed that the delay in lodging the FIR cannot be taken into consideration at the stage of consideration of anticipatory bail when the investigation is at threshold.Observing thus, the Bench of Justice Rajesh Bhardwaj denied anticipatory bail to one Maninderpal Singh who has been booked under Sections 354, 354- A, 354-D and 452 of IPC for...
The Punjab and Haryana High Court has observed that the delay in lodging the FIR cannot be taken into consideration at the stage of consideration of anticipatory bail when the investigation is at threshold.
Observing thus, the Bench of Justice Rajesh Bhardwaj denied anticipatory bail to one Maninderpal Singh who has been booked under Sections 354, 354- A, 354-D and 452 of IPC for allegedly stalking, sexually harassing and assaulting a girl with the intent to outrage her modesty.
The case in brief
Essentially, an FIR was lodged by the prosecutrix alleging that she is a student of BA studying at Punjabi University College Khuda. On April 1, 2021, when she boarded the bus, the accused caught hold of her arm and on raising alarm by her, he fled away from the spot. 
On returning home, she disclosed the same to her parents, and on their protest, the accused tendered an apology in the presence of respectable of the village. 
Thereafter in July 2021, when she was alone at home, the accused trespassed into her house and tried to kiss her. The prosecutrix raised an alarm and on hearing the same, the accused escaped from the spot. 
In order to save the dignity of the family, she remained silent. However, the accused did not mend his ways and hence, the FIR was lodged to take legal action against the accused. 
The Court Additional Sessions Judge, Bathinda denied him anticipatory bail, following which, he moved to the High Court contending that he has been falsely implicated in the case.
Court's observations 
Having perused the record of the case, the Court noted that in the instant case the prosecutrix had given the details of stalking by the petitioner and that he had alleged to have outraged the modesty of the prosecutrix repeatedly. 
The Court further noted that the prosecutrix is a young college-going girl who is repeatedly being stalked by the petitioner and therefore, the delay in lodging the FIR cannot be taken into consideration at the stage of consideration of anticipatory bail when the investigation is at the threshold. 
Further, the Court observed that the allegations against the petitioner are to be taken seriously, and thus, the case needs a thorough and fair investigation to unravel the truth, therefore, holding that the petitioner deserves no leniency for the grant of anticipatory bail, the Court dismissed the bail plea. 
Case title - Maninderpal Singh v. State of Punjab

The Delhi High Court has directed the Delhi Government to prepare a standard operating procedure (SOP) for all SDMs on the manner in which judicial orders of eviction and recovery are to be given effect to.
Justice Prathiba M Singh said that it has been “repeatedly noticed” that various orders for enforcement of possession and recovery which are to be given effect to by the concerned SDM are “not dealt with expeditiously and with alacrity.”
“The GNCTD ought to issue SOPs as guidelines for all the SDMs to ensure implementation of orders passed by the Court and also the manner in which orders of eviction and recovery that may be passed are given effect to,” the court said.
The court directed the Delhi government to prepare and circulate the SOP to all SDMs within three months. It added that the government may approach the court in case any extension of time is needed. 
“In respect of the SDM’s power under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 and other statutes there is an emergent need for sensitization of the SDM’s in order to give effect to orders passed by various Courts,” it added.
Justice Singh was hearing a plea moved by one Chatur Sain seeking direction for compliance of the order dated September 24, 2018, passed by the District Magistrate under the Senior Citizens Act, 2007. It was directed hat the possession of a property be handed over to the petitioner.
On October 18 last year in another writ petition, an undertaking was given by a woman stating that she would vacate the subject property within three weeks. 
Thereafter, on December 20, 2022, the counsel appearing for the Delhi Government and the Tehsildar submitted that the order would be enforced and steps for eviction would be taken. The court had then directed that the enforcement be given effect to and a report be filed. 
However, on February 07, the counsel appearing for Delhi Government and the SDM handed over a report stating that the subject property was locked and thus the eviction could not be carried out. 
After court’s directions, the Delhi Government on March 01 submitted that the possession of the property was handed over to the petitioner.
While disposing of the plea, the court directed the government to prepare the SOP. 
“It is repeatedly noticed by this Court that various orders for enforcement of possession and recovery which are to be given effect to by the SDM are not dealt with expeditiously and with alacrity,” it said.

The Rajasthan High Court has reiterated that power of judicial review vested in High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is one of the basic features of the Constitution and any legislation cannot override or curtail such jurisdiction.
 Justice Pushpendra Bhati further held that High Courts, while exercising the power under Article 226, would take note of the legislative intent manifested in the provisions of the Act and would exercise their jurisdiction consistent with the provisions of the enactment.
 Essentially, the petitioner- LNJ Power Ventures Ltd. had prayed to declare proposition laid down by the respondent-RERC in its Order dated 08 May, 2019 as ultra vires, in terms of Section 2(8) of the Electricity Act, 2003 read with Rule 3 of the Electricity Rules, 2005. 
The petitioner further prayed for an ex-parte direction to respondents by restraining them from taking any steps against the petitioner. In addition to this, petitioner sought quashing of notice or order, if any, issued by any of the respondents in terms of the aforementioned Order, during the pendency of the case.
 The court heard the counsels for petitioner on merits of the case and considered the preliminary objections raised on behalf of the respondents.
 The court pursued that Section 125 of the Electricity Act of 2003, permits 'any person' aggrieved by a decision of the Tribunal may file an appeal before the Supreme Court, despite not being a party to the suit. It added that the present petition, filed in 2019, has now come up for consideration and any further judicial delay in deciding the matter, would not only be inappropriate, but also against the interest of justice.
 The court observed that respondent-AVVNL has violated order dated 28.05.2019, by which a crystal clear direction was issued to the respondents to refrain from taking any coercive action against the petitioner, however, the respondents issued the impugned invoice and letter to the petitioner raising a claim of about Rs.55,47,354/-.
 Relying on Tamil Nadu Power Producers Association Vs. Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission and Ors., 2021 SCC Online APTEL 19, the court opined that the actions of respondent-AVVNL is not only illegal and in violation of the judicial order, but also unreasonable and arbitrary. 
Further relying on Whirlpool Corporation Vs. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai and Ors., (1998) 8 SCC 1, the court considered that it is the constitutional duty of the Court to provide petitioners an opportunity to seek relief in the interest of justice
 The court observed that it would be inappropriate to remand the matter back to Tribunal or dispose of the case on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. It added that arbitrariness is smack on the face of the action of the respondent No.4 in the present case.
 While rejecting respondents' preliminary objections and before making any final adjudication on the merits of the case, the court granted some time to the Advocate General to make his detailed submissions on the merits of the case.
 Additionally, the court pursued multiple Apex Court decisions and observed that the exercise of jurisdiction of the High Courts under Article 226 is no doubt discretionary, but the discretion must be exercised on sound judicial principles.
 Furthermore, the court observed that High Courts, while exercising their jurisdiction under Article 226, are duty bound to consider whether a petitioner has any alternative or effective remedy. It added that while the existence of an alternate remedy is not a bar to entertaining a writ petition, the general rule is that the existence of an alternate remedy to the aggrieved person or under the statute in question which contains a mechanism for redressal of grievance, still holds the field. 
The court also added that High Courts could entertain writ proceedings under Article 226, in exceptional cases, particularly where the cases involve a pure question of law or vires of an Act are challenged, and it would be on a case to case basis.
 The court also observed that the interest of administration of justice shall be better sub-served, if such cases are heard by the High Courts only when they involve primary questions of jurisdiction or which go to the very root of jurisdiction and where the authorities have acted beyond the provisions of the Act.
 The counsel for the petitioner, in summation, submitted that due to the following, the petitioner is entitled to seek a writ remedy before the High Court:
  Since the petitioner is not a party to the TESCO judgment, therefore, it cannot file an appeal and does not possess any effective alternate remedy; The judgment rendered in Whirlpool Corporation (supra), with respect to availability of an alternate remedy, enables the petitioner to seek relief before this Court. 
 In contrast, the Advocate General submitted that only in the case of a question arising as to the jurisdiction of a Tribunal, a writ petition before the High Court would be maintainable, and not otherwise. 
In this regard, he relied on Cicily Kallarackal Vs. Vehicle Factory (2012) 8 SCC 524, wherein Supreme Court observed that when a statutory procedure for appeal is provided in the legislation, it would not be appropriate for High Courts to then entertain writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, which would result in bypassing the procedure provided for a statutory appeal.
 The matter is next listed on 24 Feb 2022 for final hearing on merits.
 Adv. Parag Tripathi, Adv. Aniket Prasoon and Adv.Falgun Buch appeared on behalf of petitioners, whereas Advocate General Sr. Adv. M.S. Singhvi, assisted by Adv. Akhilesh Rajpurohit appeared on behalf of the respondents.
 Case Title: LNJ Power Ventures Ltd. v. Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission and Ors.

The Supreme Court Collegium has expressed its disagreement with the Centre which returned the proposal to appoint gay Advocate Saurabh Kirpal as a Judge of the Delhi High Court, based on his openness about his sexual orientation.
The Centre apprehends that given his "attachment" to the cause of gay-rights, it cannot rule out the possibility of Kirpal's bias and prejudice. It had therefore referred the proposal back for reconsideration.
However, in a resolution dated January 18 reiterating Kirpal's name, the Collegium comprising CJI DY Chandrachud, Justices SK Kaul and KM Joseph said,
"The fact that Mr. Saurabh Kirpal has been open about his orientation is a matter which goes to his credit. As a prospective candidate for judgeship, he has not been surreptitious about his orientation. In view of the constitutionally recognized rights which the candidate espouses, it would be manifestly contrary to the constitutional principles laid down by the Supreme Court to reject his candidature on that ground."
The proposal to appoint Kirpal has been pending for over five years. The recommendation was unanimously made by the Collegium of the Delhi High Court on 13 October 2017 and approved by the Supreme Court Collegium on 11 November 2021.
The SC Collegium agreed that it was advisable for Kirpal to not speak to the Press in regard to the reasons which may have weighed in the recommendations of the Collegium being sent back for reconsideration. However, it added that Kirpal possesses competence, integrity and intellect. "His appointment will add value to the Bench of the Delhi High Court and provide inclusion and diversity. His conduct and behaviour have been above board."
Another reason cited by the Centre to return the proposal is that Kirpal's partner is a Swiss National.
SC Collegium however noted that there is no apprehension that behaviour of Kirpal's partner has any bearing on national security.
"There is no reason to pre-suppose that the partner of the candidate, who is a Swiss National, would be inimically disposed to our country, since the country of his origin is a friendly nation. Many persons in high positions including present and past holders of constitutional offices have and have had spouses who are foreign Nationals. Hence, as a matter of principle, there can be no objection to the candidature of Shri Saurabh Kirpal on the ground that his partner is a foreign National."
Reiterating the proposal, the Collegium stated :
"The overwhelmingly positive aspects of the candidature of Shri Saurabh Kirpal must, therefore, weigh in the balance.
In this backdrop, the Collegium resolves to reiterate its recommendation dated 11 November, 2021 for appointment of Shri Saurabh Kirpal as a Judge of the Delhi High Court which needs to be processed expeditiously"

Questioning the Ministry of Home Affairs's decision to confine House Rent Allowance (HRA) benefit only to Personnel Below Officer Rank (PBORs), the Delhi High Court has said that every personnel in the paramilitary forces shall be entitled to the benefit irrespective of the rank, as per their entitlement. 
A division bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Saurabh Banerjee has directed the Centre and other authorities to take necessary steps within six weeks, in consultation with Ministry of Home Affairs as well as Ministry of Finance, to grant HRA benefit to such personnel. 
"We are unable to find any reason as to why officers belonging to the rank of Officers / Coy Commanders or PBROs, should not be granted similar benefit more so as the factum of their serving at far off locations has been recognized and it cannot be differentiated on cadre basis. We fail to understand why such policy decisions discriminating within the force should be permitted to continue, especially to the officers of the force who spend their lives serving the nation," the court said. 
The bench was hearing pleas moved by nine individuals, group officers in Grade-A in the Border Security Force (BSF), holding posts in the rank of Assistant Commandant, Deputy Commandant and Second-in-Command.
It was their case that despite construction of the family accommodations, they along with other similarly situated officers were neither provided with the Government accommodation nor were they being paid HRA for keeping their families at different locations. 
As per the official memorandum issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on July 31, 2017, the competent authority under the Seventh Pay Commission recommended that the personnel of the uniformed services can keep their families at any location and would be paid HRA. However, the said recommendations were confined to the PBORs and denied to the Group-A officers. 
A representation was preferred by the petitioners against the OM which was forwarded to MHA for consideration. However, the same was rejected vide a Signal dated March 15, 2018. Both the OM and Singal were challenged by the petitioners to the extent that the benefit was confined to PBORs, thereby seeking inclusion of similarly situated personnel for HRA.
The bench appreciated the recommendations of Seventh Pay Commission acknowledging services of uniformed services regarding HRA and agreed with the view that such officers are required to stay in the fields, far off from the necessary amenities while leaving their families behind. 
However, the court said it fails to understand as to why the Commission "only thought of giving parity to the PBORs of CAPF at par with PBORs of Defence Forces" while leaving behind the proposal of extending the same benefit to Coy Commanders (officers of the level of Assistant Commandants/ Deputy Commandants).
"We, while holding the Chair as the Judges of this Court as well as normal civilians, respect their will power to stay away from their families," the court said, adding that "a strange anomaly" was being sought to be corrected in the matter. 
The court noted that the respondents, neither in the counter affidavit nor during the arguments, made submission that the proposal of extending the same benefit to Coy Commanders/ Officers of Group A was under consideration.
"To the contrary, the stand of respondents is that the impugned Signal has been passed in compliance of the recommendations W.P.(C) 11083/2019 & W.P.(C) of the Seventh Pay Commission," the court noted.
Observing that the respondent authorities cannot be permitted to take a discriminatory view for personnel of different forces deployed in common areas for grant of HRA, the court set aside the impugned Signal and letter rejecting petitioners' request for HRA. 
The court also partly set aside MHA's OM, directing the authorities to extend the benefit to all the personnel of the Forces irrespective of their rank, as per their entitlement.
Title: PRAVEEN YADAV AND ORS. v. UNION OF INDIA AND ORS.

The Karnataka High Court has made it clear that workmen employed at the Indian Coffee Workers Co-operative Society Limited, if not paid minimum wages as prescribed, can make an application to the appropriate authority constituted under the Minimum Wages Act to consider their claim for recovery of minimum wages.
Further, it has said that Section 70 of the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959 does not impose any embargo on an authority under the Minimum Wages Act to consider the claim. 
A single judge Justice Suraj Govindaraj made the observation while dismissing a petition filed by the society seeking to declare the order passed dated 27-10-2021 passed by the authority, by which it directed the society for payment of minimum wages to the workmen. 
The primary contention of the society challenging the order was that the authority under the Minimum Wages Act has no jurisdiction and/or authority to decide any dispute and/or claim made by the workmen as regards the Co-operative Society in view of the amendment which has been brought about to Section 70 of the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959 in the year 2000. 
Subsequent to the said amendment, any dispute as regards any claim of an workmen/ employee as regards wages or otherwise would have to be referred to the Registrar for decision and no Civil or Labour or Revenue Court or Industrial Tribunal shall have the jurisdiction to entertain any suit or other proceedings in respect of such dispute.
The workmen opposed the plea contending that Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is a Special Enactment, which has been enacted with the purpose and intent of securing the wages of a workmen and being a Special Enactment, the same would have to be given preference over the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959 and/or the amendment made thereto and as such. The workmen cannot be deprived of the mechanism prescribed under the said enactment.
The bench noted that Section 70 of the Act deals with a dispute which are to be referred to the Registrar for a decision which includes in terms of Section 70(1)(c) of the Act, dispute between the Society, any officer, agent or employee. Any such dispute shall be referred to the Registrar for decision and no Civil, Labour or Revenue Court or Industrial Tribunal shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or other proceedings in respect of such dispute. 
Then referring to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Minimum Wages Act the bench observed “There is no justification for payment of wages less than the minimum wages and further that an organisation which pays less than minimum wages have no right to exist.” 
Thus it opined “The dispute which has been referred to in Section 70 of the Act cannot cover the non-payment of wages under the Minimum Wages Act, inasmuch as there is no dispute which requires determination.” 
It added “It is only the implementation of the Minimum Wages Act, which is required to be done. In the event of the employer making payment of minimum wages, no order needs to be passed. However, in the event of the employer not making payment of minimum wages, there would be a direction required to be issued to the employer to make payment of the minimum wages.” 
Remarking that the context of dispute which has been used in Section 70 of the Act is different from a claim for minimum wages which is the case in the present matter. The bench said “In the present case, the claim is for minimum wages in a scheduled employment, the minimum wages being notified by the Appropriate Government. If the said payment is not made, then a claim for recovery of the amount could be made under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936.” 
Accordingly it dismissed the petition and upheld the order of the authority and said “The workmen are entitled to work out their remedy before the appropriate forum.”

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that the High Court is not a creature of a statute like Employee's Compensation Act but it is a creature of the Constitution and hence the limitations of jurisdiction as contained in the Act of 1923 are not applicable to the jurisdiction of the High Court. The bench comprising Justice Sanjay Dhar was hearing a plea ...
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that the High Court is not a creature of a statute like Employee's Compensation Act but it is a creature of the Constitution and hence the limitations of jurisdiction as contained in the Act of 1923 are not applicable to the jurisdiction of the High Court.
 The bench comprising Justice Sanjay Dhar was hearing a plea review petition in terms of which the petitioners-appellants sought review of judgment and order passed by this Court in whereby the appeal filed by the appellants-review petitioners against the Award of the Commissioner under Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 (Assistant Labour Commissioner), Jammu had been allowed and while doing so, the rate of interest on the awarded sum had been reduced from 12% per annum to 6% per annum.
 The primary contention raised by the Review Petitioner was that as per the provisions contained in Section 4A of the Employee's Compensation Act, 1923 the claimants-review petitioners are entitled to statutory interest @ 12% per annum and therefore the appellate Court has passed the impugned order without considering the provisions contained in Section 4A of the Act of 1923, which amounts to an error apparent on the face of record.
 Contesting the petition the respondent-insurance Company contended that in terms of provisions contained in the Act of 1923, the appellate Court does not have any power to review its own orders. Respondent counsel further contended that even otherwise, the contentions raised by the counsel for the review petitioners cannot be decided in review jurisdiction though the same may offer grounds of challenge before a higher forum.
 Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Dhar observed that this Court, being a constitutional Court, is a Court of record, as such, it has the authority to recall its own orders. The said power is inherent in this Court by virtue of the fact of being a superior court of record.
 "It is a well settled proposition of law that being a Court of record, the High Court is vested with powers to proceed under Article 226 of Constitution of India itself and to review a judgment if it is found that there was any material suppression or the Court was not right in passing a verdict. The High Court is not a creature of a statute like Employee's Compensation Act but it is a creature of the Constitution. Hence, the limitations of jurisdiction as contained in the Act of 1923 are not applicable to the jurisdiction of the High Court. Thus, the contention of the learned counsel appearing for the respondent-insurer that the power of this Court to review its own order are circumscribed by the provisions contained in the Act of 1923 is a specious argument, which deserves to rejected", the bench recorded.
 While dealing with the other contention of the Review Petitioner that while passing impugned judgment/order this Court did not deal with the contention of the appellants-review petitioners that the deceased was earning wages of Rs.6,000/- per month and instead his wages have been assessed as Rs.4,000/- per month, Justice Dhar observed that the income of the deceased has been taken as Rs.4,000/- per month by the ALC because of the notification issued by the Central Government in terms of Sub Section (1) of Section 4 of the Act of 1923, as was applicable at the relevant time and therefore, the ALC had rightly taken income of the deceased as Rs.4,000/- per month. Thus, no fault can be found with the award passed by the ALC in this regard and rightly this Court has not interfered with this aspect of the matter while passing the order under review, the bench maintained.
 Deliberating on the last contention of the Review Petitioner that this Court, in appeal while allowing the contention of appellants/review petitioners that they are entitled to interest from the date of injury reduced the rate of interest to 6% without assigning any reason, the bench acknowledged that Section 4A(3) of the Act of 1923 clearly provides that the interest has to be payable @ 12% per annum or at such higher rate not exceeding the maximum of the lending rates of any Scheduled Bank. So the minimum statutory rate of interest, which is payable on compensation due to the claimants is 12%  per annum and hence it seems that the provisions contained in Section 4A(3) of the Act of 1923 have escaped the notice of this Court, while passing the impugned judgment/order, the bench recorded.
 Accordingly the review petition is partly allowed and judgment and order passed by this court is reviewed to the extent that instead of interest @ 6% per annum, the review petitioners/claimants shall be entitled to interest @ 12% per annum from the date from which the same has been awarded vide the judgment under review, the bench concluded.
 Case Title : Geeta Devi & Ors Vs M/s Somnath Naragmal & Anr.

The Calcutta High Court on Thursday directed students of a university who had been found to have engaged in ragging to pay for the medical treatment of the injured students and also participate in community service by teaching school students in a bid to deter the repetition of such acts. 
Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya came down heavily on the errant students by observing, 
"The petitioners have admittedly disturbed and disrupted the peaceful environment of the University. The petitioners and some others have acted like a bunch of philistines and conducted themselves in a manner which is directly contrary to what should be expected from a student. Ragging, in all its forms, is antithetical to equality and the dignity and self-respect of students, particularly when it takes on a physical and abusive form. It epitomises regressive behaviour with a perceived right to violate the bodily integrity of a fellow-student. There can be no possible excuse for acts of violence and vandalism in an academic institution."
The instant petition had been filed seeking a stay on the Notice of Expulsion dated February 22, 2022, issued by the University and also for permission to take the 8th semester examination in the B. Tech. Course. The Notice of Expulsion had been issued on the strength of accounts of eye witnesses, CCTV footage and investigation of the Anti-Ragging Committee of the university.
Pursuant to the perusal of the record, the Court noted that it is neither in dispute that that the petitioners were a party to the acts nor that the petitioners were given a hearing before the impugned notice was issued to guardians of the petitioners.
The Court further opined that there should be some measures in the form of deterrence so that acts of this nature are not repeated in future by any student of the University. It was further observed that the petitioners must be asked to make good the wrong done including damage caused to the property of the University and other expenses borne by the University. 
Accordingly, the Court directed the petitioners to pay the hospitalization charges incurred by the University for the treatment of some of the injured students. Directing the petitioners to engage in community service, the Court observed further, 
"The petitioners shall also do community service by teaching students in Sadaipur Prathamik Vidyalay and Subhasnagar FP School, Kokapur schools in Barasat, two days in a week for four hours each day for 12 weeks. The community service shall start from the 1st day of the last paper of 8th semester examination and continue for 12 weeks thereafter without interruption."
The Court further ordered the petitioners to submit a report of the classes taken and the quality of teaching imparted to the school students during the period of 12 weeks of the community service to the University. The Headmasters of the concerned schools were also instructed to certify as to whether the petitioners rendered the service as directed. 
It was further instructed that the quantum for reimbursement of the hospitalization charges and other expenses shall be informed by the University to the petitioners within 48 hours from the date of the order and that such payment should be made within 72 hours from the date on which the charges are informed to the petitioners.
However, the Court allowed the petitioners to take their semester examinations by directing, 
"The petitioners shall not be permitted to enter the University except for the purpose of taking the examination, as directed above. The study material and all other examination aids shall be provided to the petitioners so that the petitioners are not inconvenienced in any manner before the examination. The parents/family members of the petitioners shall collect the study material from the University."
Accordingly, the Court disposed of the petition by ordering the petitioners to ensure that there is no disruption in the peaceful academic atmosphere of the University at the time of taking the examination. The University shall be at liberty of informing this Court in case the petitioners cause any violation of the directions given above, it was underscored further. 
Case Title: Kaniska Roy & Anr v. The State of West Bengal & Ors

The Delhi High Court has observed that any physical act answering to all the ingredients below committed upon a minor is per-se 'carnal intercourse against the order of nature' appearing in section 377 of IPC:i. it must have to do with flesh and sensuality, namely it must be carnal;ii. there must be intercourse between individuals, without restricting it only to human-to-human...
The Delhi High Court has observed that any physical act answering to all the ingredients below committed upon a minor is per-se 'carnal intercourse against the order of nature' appearing in section 377 of IPC:
i. it must have to do with flesh and sensuality, namely it must be carnal;
ii. there must be intercourse between individuals, without restricting it only to human-to-human intercourse;iii. it must involve penetration other than penile-vaginal penetration, since by the very nature, intent and purpose of section 377, it must refer to an unnatural act, such as 'penile-anal penetration', 'digital penetration' or 'object penetration'.The Bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Anup J Bhambhani observed thus:
"Subject to the requirement of the above ingredients, we however completely agree that attempting to define the phrase 'carnal intercourse against the order of nature' with exactitude is neither possible, and perhaps not even desirable. Accordingly, though we hesitate to give the phrase 'carnal intercourse against the order of nature' any exhaustive meaning, we hold, that as a matter of law, any physical act answering to all the above ingredients, committed upon a minor is per-se 'carnal intercourse against the order of nature'."
The Court also observed that to sexually violate an innocent child is an abhorrent act; however, when the same happens within the "filial father-daughter relationship" of which purity of affection is a sine-qua-non, the act descends to a different depth of depravity.
"Without at all appearing to be Biblical, crime in society is one thing; but crime within the closest confines of the family, adds to it the element of sin. Such acts must be dealt, with the requisite level of severity," the Court added. 
The development came while the Court was dealing with two appeals arising out of a common judgment of conviction and the sentencing order in connection with a case wherein sexual offences were committed against a minor. The allegation was that the prosecutrix's father, one of the convicts, and his friend Kamal, the other convict, committed offences punishable under sec. 376(2)(g) and 377 of IPC during the period of May to July 2012.
Accepting the statement made by the prosecutrix under sec. 164 of CrPC as well her deposition in court, the High Court reiterated that a court must not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not fatal, to throw-out an otherwise reliable prosecution case.
The Court upheld the order of conviction by agreeing that both convicts were guilty of the offence under sec. 377 read with section 34 IPC; however it said that the conclusion as regards the offence under sec. 376(2)(g) IPC as arrived upon by the trial court was flawed.
Accordingly, the conviction order and sentencing order regarding the offence under section 377 read with section 34 IPC were upheld and modified. 
"For our purposes in the present case, we need only observe that the expanded definition of rape as contained in amended section 375 with retrospective effect from 03.02.2013, did not exist on the statute book at the time of commission of the offence by the appellants i.e. on or before 22.07.2012; and there is neither any allegation nor has anything come forth in evidence to show that the appellants committed any penetrative sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix. Accordingly, in our view, the finding of the learned trial court that the appellants are guilty of the offence under section 376(2)(g) is untenable; and is accordingly set-aside," the Court said. 
The Court also touched upon the meaning of the phrase 'carnal intercourse against the order of nature' under sec. 377 of IPC. Accordingly, the Court concluded the following after going through the jurisprudence of the said provision:
- Though the restrictive meaning of the phrase 'sexual intercourse' will not deter the court from interpreting the phrase 'carnal intercourse' in its fullest ambit, we must be guided by the legal interpretation given by the Hon'ble Supreme Court to the phrase 'sexual intercourse' in Sakshi (supra), which is heterosexual intercourse involving penetration of the vagina by the penis.
- This interpretation turns inter-alia on the explanation appended to section 375, which points to the requirement of 'penetration', for an act to amount to sexual intercourse. A similar explanation appearing in section 377 makes 'penetration' a necessary ingredient of the offence of 'carnal intercourse' as well. The offence under section 377 would therefore arise when there is 'penetrative intercourse' which is 'against the order of nature'.
With the said observations, the appeals were dismissed. 
Case Title: KAMAL v. State

The Supreme Court has observed that the proceedings questioning the caste certificate of an employee, except in the most exceptional circumstances, can’t be conducted ex-parte.
 The bench of Justices Aniruddha Bose and Krishna Murari further observed that in the proceedings where the genuineness of an employee belonging to a certain community is under consideration, the question doesn’t only pertain to his employment but also concerns his identity, and hence, the person must have a right to be heard and must be given the right to cross-examine the witnesses.
 With this, the Court directed the Indian Bank to grant all post-retirement benefits to one R. Sundaram (appellant) who had served the bank for 38 years before he retired as a Scale 3 officer.
 The appellant had moved the Supreme Court against the Madras High Court’s 2020 Judgment and order wherein his challenge to the denial of his post-retirement benefits was dismissed.
 The case in brief
 The Appellant had secured employment with the Indian bank on the basis of a community certificate dated November 15, 1975, certifying that he was from the Konda Reddy Community, a Scheduled Tribe.
 During his tenure in the bank, the district collector concerned, without conducting any inquiry, canceled the community certificate granted to him. Aggrieved by the same, he moved to the High Court in 1998. 
 In August 2009, the HC remanded the matter back to the Tamil Nadu State Level Scrutiny Committee to conduct a fresh inquiry. 
 However, even after the High Court order, the verification with regard to his communal status of the Appellant was not concluded, and this led to the Appellant’s retirement without realization of his retirement benefits.
 Now, to seek his post-retirement benefits, he again moved to the High Court in 2013 by way of filing a writ plea, and his plea was disposed of in July 2014 by directing the Scrutiny Committee to complete the enquiry within a period of eight weeks.
 The enquiry got concluded in November 2017 with the finding that the Appellant, in fact, did not belong to the Konda Reddy Community. 
 Challenging the same, he again moved to the HC, wherein the Court, in December 2017, remanded the matter back to the scrutiny committee whilst quashing the show cause notice issued to him and the enquiry report.
 The Committee again held an inquiry (ex-parte) and concluded that his caste certificate was not correct based on vigilance reports and other expert reports. 
 Against the same, he moved the HC, however, his plea and subsequently, a review plea was dismissed, prompting him to move to the SC.
 Arguments put forth
 Before the SC, it was argued that as per HC’s December 2017 order, the Appellant was to be given due opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses, and copies of all documents relied on by the Respondents were to be furnished to the Appellant, however, the same was not done.
 It was further submitted that at the time when he was given the cessation order, no enquiry against him was pending and that in the entire process, he has been subject to harassment for almost 19 years. 
 On the other hand, the respondents argued that notice was duly served on the Appellant, and despite that, he did not show up in the proceedings. 
 It was also argued that due to the Appellant not showing up, the proceedings were adjourned, but even after the adjournment the Appellant did not show up, and hence the committee had no option but to pass its decision ex-parte.
 Analysis by the Supreme Court
 At the outset, the Court expressed its displeasure over the treatment meted out to the appellant as it observed that while applying for the post, he had supplied the Caste Document and the same was verified, however, after being given employment, the document re-evaluation proceedings were kept pending for 19 years, dangling like a sword on his head.
 “After serving the Respondent bank for 38 years, the Appellant, two days before his superannuation received his cessation order without there being any proper enquiry. Further, on communication made to the respondent no.1, it was found that on the date of passing the cessation order, no case was pending against the Appellant. To us, a very clear pattern of harassment is visible, and there appears to be a sinister motive against the Appellant and his right to pensionary benefits,” the Court observed.
 Further, referring to Madhuri Patil and Another Vs Additional Commissioner, Tribal Development and Others (1994) 6 SCC 241, the Court noted that the exercise of verification of community certificate must be completed expeditiously.
 “In the present case however, as has been mentioned above, there has been an inordinate and unexplained delay of 19 years, an amount of time which cannot be fathomed within the ambit of reasonable time,” the Court further observed as it noted that two reports declaring the community certificate of the Appellant as fake were submitted after inordinate and unexplained delay.
 Taking note of the fact that in the appellant’s case, the Court noted that though the inquiry was conducted twice, however, on both occasions, the opportunity of hearing was not accorded to the appellant, making it a case of violation the principle of “Audi Alteram Partem”, a principle of natural justice.
 In this regard, the Court stressed that any person, whose entire identity, and their past, present and future rights are challenged, must at the least be given an opportunity to be fairly heard.
 “A community certificate in cases of scheduled tribe communities, unlike any other piece of paper, is an acknowledgment of a person belonging to a community which has faced years of oppression. The Constitution of India guarantees certain rights to people from Scheduled Tribe communities on grounds of historical injustice, and for the translation of such rights from paper to real life, the community certificate in most cases becomes an essential document. This certificate, whilst being an acknowledgment of history, is also a document that tries to rectify such historical injustice by becoming a tool that fabricates constitutional rights into reality. In such a scenario where the validity of a community certificate is put to question, keeping in mind the importance of the document and the effect it has on people’s rights, the proceedings questioning the document cannot, except in the most exceptional circumstances, be done ex-parte,” the Court observed (emphasis supplied).
 Against this backdrop, the Court found that the burden of proof on the respondents to disprove the nature of the certificate had not been discharged and hence, the Court presumed the community certificate of the Appellant to be genuine and held that the Appellant would be entitled to the post-retirement benefits accrued to him by way of his 38-year long service.
The Court also that the notice of the proceedings was in fact served upon one Mr. Sudarshan and not upon R. Sundaram, the appellant.
 With this, impugned orders of the Madras HC were set aside and the Indian bank was directed to grant all post-retirement benefits to the Appellant which were denied to him along with 6% Simple Interest on account of unnecessary withholding of payment, from the date the payment was due to the date of actual payment

Pension- The right to pensionary benefit is a constitutional right and as such cannot be taken away without proper justification-the grant of pensionary benefits is not a bounty, but a right of the employee, and as such cannot be denied without proper justification - Para 11 & 12.
Community Certificate- Court is appalled at the treatment given to the Appellant by the Respondents herein. The Appellant, before applying to the post reserved for ST candidates supplied all documents required in support of his claim as a ST candidate, and got the documents verified and approved. After being given employment however, the re evaluation of the authenticity of the documents of the Appellant have been kept pending for 19 years, dangling like a sword on the Appellants head - Para 13
Community Certificate - The exercise of verification of community certificate must be completed expeditiously - Para 16
Community Certificate - A community certificate in cases of scheduled tribe communities, unlike any other piece of paper, is an acknowledgment of a person belonging to a community which has faced years of oppression. The Constitution of India guarantees certain rights to people from Scheduled Tribe communities on grounds of historical injustice, and for the translation of such rights from paper to real life, the community certificate in most cases becomes an essential document. This certificate, whilst being an acknowledgment of history, is also a document that tries to rectify such historical injustice by becoming a tool that fabricates constitutional rights into reality. In such a scenario where the validity of a community certificate is put to question, keeping in mind the importance of the document and the effect it has on people’s rights, the proceedings questioning the document cannot, except in the most exceptional circumstances, be done ex-parte - Para 22

The Madras High Court recently observed that once FIR has been registered against a person, his/her re-examination by the investigation agency on its own should not be permitted merely by registering another FIR with regard to the same occurrence."If such protection is not given to a suspect, then possibility of abuse of investigating powers by the police cannot be ruled out.

The Madras High Court recently observed that once FIR has been registered against a person, his/her re-examination by the investigation agency on its own should not be permitted merely by registering another FIR with regard to the same occurrence.
"If such protection is not given to a suspect, then possibility of abuse of investigating powers by the police cannot be ruled out. It would result into a multiplicity of proceedings and unnecessary harassment to the accused and registration of multiple FIR's on the same occurrence would be hit by the doctrine of sameness and it would have to be obliterated, as it would amount to violation of fundamental rights of a citizen," the bench of Justice G.K. Ilanthiraiyan further remarked.
The case in brief
The Court was essentially dealing with a plea filed under section 482 CrPC to quash the FIR registered by the state police against the petitioner for offences under Sections 468, 471, and 420 of IPC.
As per the prosecution's case, the petitioner was designated as a Secretary of one of the basic units of St.John Ambulance institution and he was working till the year 2012. He was removed from the association, however, he continued to use the Company's name by illegally creating an email ID and also by using a bank account in the name of the association. 
He approached various companies, schools, colleges, etc. by using the name of M/s.St.John Ambulance Association to impart first aid training. The trainer license issued to the petitioner also lapsed in the month of February 2018 and even after the expiry of the trainer license, he conducted first-aid training through his associates.
Now, one, J.K.Siva Kumar, Head-HR, M/s.Leo Prime Company Private Limited approached him for getting the first-aid certificate for 39 employees of his concern. The petitioner collected an amount of Rs.12,250/- by concealing the facts and misusing the name of St.Johns Ambulance with a view to secure illegal gain. 
Subsequently, an FIR was lodged against him in the year 2015, however, the same was quashed subsequently by the High Court. Despite this, the second respondent preferred another complaint was made with the same set of allegations, and the FIR was registered. 
It is the petitioner's case that he is very much eligible for organizing and conducting the said courses as he is a certified trainer and an authorized lecturer for conducting First-Aid and Home Nursing Courses with the approval of St.John Ambulance.
It was also his case that when an FIR had already been registered against him, which was subsequently quashed then why subsequent FIRs had been registered on the same set of allegations? Therefore, his grievance was that the offences are same and for the very same occurrence, three FIRs have been registered as against the same accused persons.
Court's observations
At the outset, the Court observed that sometimes it happens that several pieces of information are given to a police officer in charge of a police station in respect of the same incident involving one or more than one cognizable offences, but in such a case, the investigation officer need not enter all such information of them in the FIR and therefore, the Court added, successive FIR's not being a counter case, filed in connection with the same or connected cognizable offence cannot be sustained and not permissible under law.
With this, the Court quashed the entire proceedings in crime No.7 of 2018 registered by the police for offences under Sections 468, 471, and 420 of IPC as against the petitioner, and thus, the instant criminal original petition was allowed.

In a judgement delivered recently, the Supreme Court through a three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice N.V. Ramana and Justices A.S. Bopanna and Hima Kohli clarified two important positions of the law relating to the offence of Robbery under the Indian Penal Code. The question that came up for the Court's consideration was whether the charge under Section 397 of IPC would hold in case the firearm had not been put to use. 
 The judgement authored by Justice Bopanna notes that in order to meet the ingredients of Section 397 of the IPC, first, it is not necessary for the offender to have literally used the weapon for the purpose it serves. Even showcasing the same to create fear in the mind of the victim would be sufficient. The Court held: 
"It is clear that the use of the weapon to constitute the offence under Section 397 IPC does not require that the 'offender' should actually fire from the firearm or actually stab if it is a knife or a dagger but the mere exhibition of the same, brandishing or holding it openly to threaten and create fear or apprehension in the mind of the victim is sufficient."
 Secondly, Section 397 of the I does not automatically apply to all co-accused unless a charge under Section 34 of the IPC is specifically raised. Only the person who actually 'uses' a deadly weapon can be framed for the usage of the same. The Court notes: 
"If the charge of committing the offence is alleged against all the accused and only one among the 'offenders' had used the firearm or deadly weapon, only such of the 'offender' who has used the firearm or deadly weapon alone would be liable to be charged under Section 397 IPC."
 Factual Background
 The trial court convicted the appellant along with two co-accused under Sections 392 and 397 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 read with Section 11/13 of the Madhya Pradesh Dakaiti Aur Vyapharan Pravbhavit Kshetra Adhiniyam 1981 Act. The Madhya Pradesh High Court reappreciated the manner in which evidence was raised against the accused and heard a common appeal from all the accused. The primary accused, Ram Ratan, appealed from the impugned judgement and order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court. 
 Arguments by the Counsels
 The counsel for the appellant contended the firearm even if was proved to be carried, had not been used and as such the charge under Section 397 IPC would not lie. Further, even if the incident of robbery is proved against the appellant there is no evidence which states that he used a deadly weapon. If the following is not satisfied, the counsel argued, the charge would fall under Section 392 of the IPC and the appellant having undergone nearly four years of imprisonment has already undergone a sufficient punishment under that provision.
 The counsel for the State contended that the evidence against the appellant had been corroborated as the stolen motorcycle and the mobile phone were recovered and the gun used for the robbery had also been seized and examined by the expert who opined that it was in a working condition. Since the actual use of the firearm is not required, the exhibition of the same is enough to satisfy Section 397 of the IPC.
 The Court while deciding this matter took into consideration the case of Shri Phool Kumar v. Delhi Administration n (1975) 1 SCC 797 where the Apex Court talked about the difficulty that arose in several High Courts for the meaning of the word "uses" in Section 397. Therein the Court had held that:
"The term 'offender' in that section, as rightly held by several High Courts, is confined to the offender who uses any deadly weapon. The use of a deadly weapon by one offender at the time of committing robbery cannot attract Section 397 for the imposition of the minimum punishment on another offender who had not used any deadly weapon" 
The Court also took note of the 2007 Supreme Court ruling in the case of Dilawar Singh vs. State of Delhi (2007) 12 SCC 641 wherein it was held that: 
""Offender" refers to only culprit who actually used deadly weapon. When only one has used the deadly weapon, others cannot be awarded the minimum punishment. It only envisages the individual liability and not any constructive liability. Section 397 IPC is attracted only against the particular accused who uses the deadly weapon or does any of the acts mentioned in the provision. But the other accused are not vicariously liable under that section for acts of the co-­accused."
 In this light, the Court come to the conclusion that: 
"The use of the weapon to constitute the offence under Section 397 IPC does not require that the 'offender' should actually fire from the firearm or actually stab if it is a knife or a dagger but the mere exhibition of the same, brandishing or holding it openly to threaten and create fear or apprehension in the mind of the victim is sufficient." (Para 17)
On the question of framing of charger against co-accused, the Courrt holds that: 
"If the charge of committing the offence is alleged against all the accused and only one among the 'offenders' had used the firearm or deadly weapon, only such of the 'offender' who has used the firearm or deadly weapon alone would be liable to be charged under Section 397 IPC. The Court finally held that Section 397 of the IPC can be applied in cases where the accused has used a deadly weapon to commit robbery, to the extent of causing fear in the mind of the victim by showcasing the weapon, it is not necessary to cause grievous hurt with the said weapon. The Court also held that the "offender" is the accused who actually uses the weapon and the co-accused cannot be held liable if they are not proven to have used a deadly weapon." (Para 17)
On the question of vicariability of the offence, the Court notes:
"In such circumstance, in the teeth of the offence under Section 397 IPC being applicable to the offender alone,the vicariability of the same will also have to be noted if the charge against the accused under Sections 34, 149 IPC and such other provisions of law, which may become relevant, is also invoked along with Section 397 IPC." (Para 18)
 In the instant case, since the facts and the evidence does not indicate that the appellant could be construed as an 'offender' who used the firearm, the charge alleged against him and held to be proved by the trial Court as also the High Court under Section 397 IPC and Section 11/13 of MPDVPK Act, 1981 cannot be sustained.In light of the same, the Court decided that the punishment inflicted upon the appellant under Section 392 is sustainable to the extent of participating in the offence of committing robbery. 
The Court set aside the sentence of 7 years rigorous imprisonment imposed on the accused and deemed a punishment of 3 years to be sufficient. As the appellant had already served 3 years, 5 months and 1 day in prison, the sentence is deemed as undergone.
Case Title: Ram Ratan v State of Madhya Pradesh
Counsels: Mr. Shishir Kumar Saxena, for the appellant, Mr. Sunny Choudhary for the respondent

The Gujarat High Court recently upheld the acquittal of a general store owner, who was booked under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, after noticing that the mandatory provisions relating to cleanliness of bottles in which the samples were collected, were not followed.
Justice Ashokkumar Joshi observed that the Food Safety Officer himself admitted that the captioned bottles were not clean at the place of collecting the sample. He had also admitted that the covers of the bottles were not cleaned at the time. It said,
"This Court is of the view that though the complainant had explained all the formalities for collecting the samples but, so longer as the mandatory provisions are concerned for cleanliness of bottles and also cleanliness of the cover is concerned, same is not proved. On the contrary admitted that the same is not cleaned and therefore...this Court is of the opinion that (trial) Court has given cogent and convincing reasons for acquitting the respondent, which learned APP has failed to dislodge them."
 The brief facts of the case were that the Food Inspector, upon collecting a sample of Black pepper (whole) from the Accused's store found that there was mineral oil in the sample and the same was prohibited under Rule 44(AAA). Accordingly, the Accused was booked for offences under the Food Adulteration Act. However, later he was acquitted by the trial court which was challenged by the State in the instant criminal appeal.
 The trial court had concluded that the Accused had followed all mandatory rules under the Act and that there was no breach of provision or violation of any rules. However, the State insisted that the trial court had not evaluated the oral evidence adduced by the Prosecution. 
Per contra, the Accused argued that the Food Safety Officer had admitted that the captioned three bottled of the sample were not cleaned and therefore, there was a violation of the provisions of the Act. He also admitted that the said bottles had earlier contained groundnut oil and these were not cleaned before collecting the sample of the Black Pepper. Therefore, the Trial Court had rightly acquitted the accused.
 The High Court referred to the scope of interference in acquittal appeals and opined that the Court must remember that prejudice lies in favour of the Accused in acquittal appeals. Further, if two reasonable conclusions are possible basis the evidence on record, the Appellate Court should not reverse the acquittal of the Accused unless there is some manifest illegality or perversity in the judgement. To bolster this view, the Single Judge relied on Mallikarjun Kodagali (Dead) represented through Legal Representatives v. State of Karnataka and Others, (2019) 2 SCC 752 and other precedents. 
The Bench then emphasised that the sample bottles were not cleaned before collecting the sample even though it was mandated in the Act. The Court also pointed to the cross examination of the law officer where she stated that she had not taken the sample and she did not know the aspect of the complaint or the issue of collecting the samples.
 Keeping this in view, the criminal appeal was dismissed.

While deliberating upon the 'larger question' regarding 'installation of towers on residential building', the Punjab & Haryana High Court on Wednesday (03rd March) directed the Punjab Government to not allow installation of towers on the residential buildings till further orders (as an interim measure). The Bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh has passed this order in view of the fact that installation of towers in a haphazard manner may endanger lives and property of the people and would violate their rights under Article 21 of the Constitution. Apart from this, the Bench has also issued a notice of motion to the Punjab State Government asking them to clarify as to whether a uniform policy was being adopted across the Punjab or stand-alone instructions had been given for a particular place (SAS Nagar). Another question which arose before the Court is- as to whether due to wind velocity at times, there can be a danger of the tower being dislocated and endanger the lives of the people? As a preliminary observation, the Court noted that apart from the tower, there are batteries on the roof which may not be able to bear the burden. The matter has been posted for further hearing on 10th March 2021. Recently, while refusing to issue a mandamus to the respondents for shifting the Mobile Tower to another place, the Uttarakhand High Court had said that it is neither the responsibility nor the duty of the Court to run the administration
 Also, the Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a writ petition seeking removal of a mobile tower from a residential area on the ground that it has deleterious effects on human health. Relying on the decision of a Division Bench in Asha Mishra v. State of UP & Ors. ;2017 (1) UPLBEC 261, the Court held,
 "Such matters must be left to the mature wisdom of the Government or the implementing agency. It is their forte. In such cases, if the situation demands, the courts should take only a detached decision based on the pattern of the well settled principles of administrative law."

The Punjab And Haryana High Court recently granted bail to a man as it noted that the victim was a court employee and despite knowing the consequences and legal remedies, she  kept quiet for a long time.
Granting bail to the accused, the Bench of Justice Anoop Chitkara observed thus:
"The victim is an employee, matured lady and working in the Court and she would know the consequences and legal remedies. Instead her keeping quiet for such a long time would make out a case for bail to the petitioner."
The case in brief
The Court was seeking anticipatory bail in an FIR registered agaisnt him for rape under Section 376. It was alleged by the matured adult lady victim that the petitioner slowly and steadily started making friendship with her and on one day took her to his home where he tried to establish sexual relationships with her. 
On her refusal, he played Anand Karaj Sahib from his mobile phone and placed the Gutka Sahib and took laavaan phere with her. He also applied vermillion on the parting line of my head. After that, he committed sexual intercourse with her. Later on, he resiled from the said marriage.
It was her allegation that she was rape by him multiple times and also blackmailed her under the protest that he would show her nude photographs and video to her father
Court's observations 
The Court took inot account the edcuation level of the victim and the fact that she is court employee to hold that her long silence had made out a case of bail for the accused. "The petitioner is a first offender, and one of the relevant factors would be to provide an opportunity to course-correct," the Court stressed.
In view of this, without commenting on the merits of the case, in the facts and circumstances peculiar to tge case, and for the reasons mentioned above, the Court said that the petitioner had made out a case for bail.
Thus, the Court ordered that in the event of arrest, the petitioner shall be released on bail in the case, subject to his furnishing a personal bond of INR 10,000/-, and furnishing one surety for Rs. Twenty-Five thousand only, to the satisfaction of the concerned Investigator.

The Gujarat High Court has held that past services of the daily-wagers where they have completed 240 days of continuous service as per Section 25B of the Industrial Disputes Act, would qualify for pension.
Justice Biren Vaishnav, heavily relying on the case of Executive Engineer, Panchayat v. Samudabhai Jyotibhai Phedi, held,
"for counting the period for purposes of pension, the date of initial appointment needs to be taken into consideration and for the purposes of taking initial date of appointment those years in which the petitioners have completed 240 days have to be counted for the purposes of pension."
The Court was hearing a petition seeking the revision of pension and the payment of gratuity from the date of initial appointment of the Petitioners along with arrears and additionally release the benefits of 300 days unavailed privilege leave in favour of the Petitioners as envisaged in the Government Resolution of 1988 with interest. 
The Petitioners indicated that they had worked with the Respondents for more than three decades and pension payment orders were annexed for the purpose of counting pension from the date of regularisation.
 The Petitioner contested that the issues raised before the High Court were already settled in the Executive Engineer, Panchayat (Maa & M) Department vs. Samudabhai Jyotibhai Bhedi., 2014(4) GLR 2952 matter. Per contra, the Respondent submitted that there was no evidence to suggest that the Petitioners had completed 240 days in each year of service from the date of initial appointment till they completed 10 years of service to avail the benefits.
 The High Court referred to the decision of the Single Judge Bench in Samudabhai to hold:
 "entire past services of daily-wager which was continuous is liable to be reckoned for the purpose of pensionary benefits and for the purpose of granting pension."
It observed that petitioners are entitled to the pensionary benefits by reckoning the entire length of service from the date of initial joining for the purposes of pension and other terminal benefits. The respondents were therefore directed to fix the pension of the petitioners by counting their services from the date of their initial joining until the date of their retirement and in doing so each year of service preceding the date of regularization in which years the petitioners have completed 240 days shall only be considered for recalculating pension.
The retirement benefits, except leave encashment benefit shall be paid to the petitioners within a period of eight weeks, the Court said.
"As far as entitlement of the petitioners for leave encashment is concerned, the issue is pending and is at large before the Apex Court and learned advocate for the petitioner would concede that the issue regarding leave encashment can be dealt with at a later point of time depending on the outcome of the SLP, if occasion arises," the Court noted in its order.
 Case Title:  Harkishanbhai Dahyabhai Lad vs State Of Gujarat
 Case No.: C/SCA/11624/2020

The Bombay High Court recently held that a child who was born after the cut-off date but passed away before nomination, would not be counted to disqualify the parent from contesting panchayat elections under the Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act, 1959.
Justice Arun R. Pedneker of the Aurangabad Bench set aside the authorities’ order disqualifying a woman on the ground that she had more than two children after the cut-off date. 
“Thus a child, born after the cut-off date and has passed away before the nomination is not to be counted for the purpose of disqualification…In the instant case, since the authorities below have proceeded on the basis that, whether the child born after the cut-off date is dead as on the date of nomination is a immaterial fact, that the authorities have committed error in law in passing the impugned orders,” the court held.
Section 14(1)(j-i) of the Act provides that a person having more than two children shall not be a member of the panchayat. However, candidates having more than two children before the cut-off date are protected from disqualification by a proviso to the section.
The petitioner was declared elected unopposed as a member Gram Panchayat Nimgaon Khalu in January 2021. A resident of the village filed a complaint before the Additional Collector, Ahmednagar under section 14(1)(j-1) of the Act. He claimed that she had more than two children and one of the children was born after the cut-off date of September 9, 2001. 
The Additional Collector disqualified her, and the appellate authority upheld the order of disqualification. 
Advocate Suvarna Zaware for the petitioner contended before the high court that the child born on February 12, 2002 was a premature child and passed away shortly after birth on April 02, 2002.
Advocate Prashant Nangare for the complainant disputed the birth certificate of the petitioner’s fourth child which records the date of birth as June 10, 2001 (before cut-off date). He argued that this child is actually the child who was born on February 12, 2002 (after cut-off date) as it is not possible to have another child within eight months of the birth of earlier child.
The court relied on the full bench judgement in Subhash Sajesingh Gavit v. Returning Officer and said that the death of the child as well as proviso to Section 14(1)(j-1) would protect the petitioner.
“Since the child born after the cut-off date being dead and more than two children born prior to the cut-off date being protected under the proviso to Section 14 (1)(j-1) of the Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959, the petitioner would not incur disqualification”.
The court however, noted that the claim of death of the petitioner’s child itself is disputed.
The doctor at the High Court Dispensary informed the court that it is medically possible to have a premature child born within the time frame and such a child would be very week. Hence, the petitioner’s contention that a premature child was born and expired is possible.
The court said that the authorities have not considered the Subhash Sajesingh Gavit case which held that that the number of children has to be considered as on the date of nomination.
“The Collector as well as the appellate authority – the Additional Commissioner has proceeded on the basis that if the candidate has more than 2 children and one of them being born beyond the cut-off date of 12.09.2001 the candidate incurres disqualification,” the court noted.
The court further noted that the authorities did not consider the evidence regarding the demise of the child born on February 12, 2002 which is also disputed.
Hence the court set aside the impugned orders and sent the matter back to the Collector for fresh consideration. It permitted the parties to lead the evidence as to whether the child passed away or not.
The court noted that application for registering the death of the child born on 12.02.2002 is pending. The court advised the Magistrate to decide the application expeditiously as it will have a direct bearing on the case.

The Court held that husband raping his wife is amenable to the offence of rape under Section 376 IPC.In a significant judgement, the Karnataka High Court has rejected a petition filed by a husband seeking to drop charges of rape under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code, levelled against him by his wife.The Court did not accept the husband's argument that the charge cannot be framed against him due to the exception to marital rape from the offence of rape as per Exception 2 to Section 375...
In a significant judgement, the Karnataka High Court has rejected a petition filed by a husband seeking to drop charges of rape under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code, levelled against him by his wife.
The Court did not accept the husband's argument that the charge cannot be framed against him due to the exception to marital rape from the offence of rape as per Exception 2 to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code. The Court observed that the exemption cannot be absolute.
"The exemption of the husband on committal of such assault/rape, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, cannot be absolute, as no exemption in law can be so absolute that it becomes a license for commission of crime against society", the Court said.
The Court observed that the exemption to marital rape is "regressive" and would run counter to the principle of equality enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
 A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna said ,
"The Constitution, a fountainhead of all statutes depicts equality. The Code practices discrimination. Under the Code every other man indulging in offences against woman is punished for those offences. But, when it comes to Section 375 of IPC the exception springs. In my considered view, the expression is not progressive but regressive, wherein a woman is treated as a subordinate to the husband, which concept abhors equality."
 "If a man, a husband, a man he is, can be exempted of allegation of commission of ingredients of Section 375 of the IPC, inequality percolates into such provision of law. Therefore, it would run counter to what is enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution", the Court observed.
The Court further said: 
"All human beings under the Constitution are to be treated equal, be it a man, be it a woman and others. Any thought of inequality, in any provision of law, would fail the test of Article 14 of the Constitution. Woman and man being equal under the Constitution cannot be made unequal by Exception-2 to Section 375 of the IPC. It is for the law makers to ponder over existence of such inequalities in law".
It may be noted that the Court has not ruled on the constitutionality of Exemption 2 to Section 375 IPC. It may also be recalled that the Delhi High Court has recently reserved judgment on a batch of petitions challenging the exemption to marital rape.
Husband raping a woman amenable to punishment under Section 376 IPC
It added, "A man who is well acquainted with a woman performs all the ingredients as is found in pre or post amendment to Section 375 of the IPC, can be proceeded against for offences punishable under Section 376 of IPC. Therefore, a man sexually assaulting or raping a woman is amenable to punishment under Section 376 of IPC."
 Junking the contention of the petitioners counsel that if the man is the husband, performing the very same acts as that of another man, he is exempted, the bench said "A man is a man; an act is an act; rape is a rape, be it performed by a man the "husband" on the woman "wife".
 Case Background:
 The wife filed the complaint against the husband on 21.03.2017 with the police. Following which the an offences punishable under Sections 506, 498A, 323, 377 of the Indian Penal Code ('IPC' for short) and Section 10 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 ('POCSO Act' for short).
 The Police, after investigation, filed a charge sheet against the petitioner. While filing the charge sheet, the offences punishable under Sections 498A, 354, 376, 506 of the IPC and Sections 5(m) and (l) r/w Section 6 of the POCSO Act, 2012, are invoked.
 The Special Court framed charges against the petitioner alone in terms of its order dated 10.08.2018, for offences punishable under Sections 376, 498A and 506 of IPC and Section 5(m) and (l) r/w Section 6 of the POCSO Act. It is at that juncture, the petitioner has knocked the doors of this Court in the subject criminal petition seeking the following prayers
 Court findings:
 The bench on going through the chargesheet said "The charge sheet filed by the Police after investigation (supra) also depicts graphic details of the demonish lust of accused No.1 who even according to the investigation has had unnatural sex; every time has sexual intercourse torturing or abusing the wife, or threatening to beat the daughter or beating the daughter, all for satisfaction of the gory carnal lust."
 The bench took into account the genesis of Section 375 of the IPC and its exception and how its roots in the Code propounded by Macaulay in 1837, which became the basis for the Indian Penal Code of 1860, which governs the penal provisions even as on date with certain changes on certain occasions.
 It said "Exception to Section 375 has existed in the IPC since the time of its enactment by the British in the year 1860. Exception-2 then was guided by the laws that were existent in all the countries where the British had their foot on. They were several decades ago. It was founded and remained on the premise of a contract in the medieval law that husbands wielded their power over their wives."
 It then observed "Post Republic, India is governed by the Constitution. The Constitution treats woman equal to man and considers marriage as an association of equals. The Constitution does not in any sense depict the woman to be subordinate to a man. The Constitution guarantees fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 which are right to live with dignity, personal liberty, bodily integrity, sexual autonomy, right to reproductive choices, right to privacy, right to freedom of speech and expression. Under the Constitution, the rights are equal; protection is also equal."
 Referring to the amendment carried out in section 375, post the Nirbhaya case of 2013, the court said "The amended exception depicts intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age would not be a rape. The post amendment the exception adds the words 'sexual acts' by a man along with the words 'sexual intercourse'. The difference is inclusion of the word "or sexual acts". Therefore, the exception now is of sexual intercourse and other sexual acts by the husband stand exempted."
 It added "Therefore, a woman being a woman is given certain status; a woman being a wife is given a different status. Likewise, a man being a man is punished for his acts; a man being a husband is exempted for his acts. It is this inequality that destroys the soul of the Constitution which is Right to Equality."
 Further the court relied on Article 14, 15, 16, 21, 23, 39, 243D of the Constitution of India, various provisions related to protection of women as mentioned in the Indian Penal Code and also enactments like the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956. The National Commission for Women, Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.
 It said "On a coalesce of all the afore-said and afore-quoted Articles of the Constitution, the provisions of the IPC and specific Acts promulgated, what would unmistakably emerge is the rights of women, protection of women and their equal status to that of a man without exception. Therefore, women are equal in its true sense factually and legally."
The Court also noted that the Justice Verma committee had recommended the deletion of exemption for marital rape.
 Marital Rape Illegal in other countries:
 The court mentioned that Marital rape is illegal in 50 American States, 3 Australian States, New Zealand, Canada, Israel, France, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia and several others. In the United Kingdom, which the present Code largely draws from, has also removed the exception pursuant to a judgment rendered by the House of Lords in R v. R in the year 1991. Therefore, the Code that was made by the rulers then, has itself abolished the exception given to husbands.
 Inequality in Code:
 The bench said "Justice Verma Committee (supra) also recommended for deletion of the exception of marital rape. But, the amendment came about was only replacing the word 'rape' with 'sexual assault' in Section 375 of IPC. Therefore, the situation now emerges is equality pervades through the Constitution, but inequality exists in the Code qua - Exception-2 to Section 375 of the IPC."
 Husband Not Protected by Institution of Marriage:
 The court also refused to accept the submission of the petitioners counsel that the husband is protected by the institution of marriage for any of his acts being performed, as is performed by a common man, again sans countenance.
 The court said "Institution of marriage does not confer, cannot confer and in my considered view, should not be construed to confer any special male privilege or a license for unleashing of a brutal beast. If it is punishable to a man, it should be punishable to a man albeit, the man being a husband."
 Charge framed under section 376 upheld
 On going through the complaint afore-extracted and written communications, the bench said "The wife-the complainant, cries foul in no unmistakable terms that she is being brutally, sexually harassed keeping her as a sex slave for ages. The contents of the complaint are an outburst of tolerance of the wife of the brutal acts of the petitioner. It is akin to eruption of a dormant volcano."
 It added "In the teeth of the facts, as narrated in the complaint, in my considered view, no fault can be found with the learned Sessions Judge taking cognizance of the offences punishable under Section 376 of IPC and framing a charge to that effect."
 Further the court observed "In the light of the ghastly allegations against the petitioner-husband in the complaint and several other communications, I find no error committed by the learned Sessions Judge in taking cognizance, framing the charge under Section 376 of the IPC and also rejecting the application to drop the said charge. If the allegation of rape is removed from the block of offences alleged, it would, in the peculiar facts of this case, be doing tremendous injustice to the complainant-wife and would amount to putting a premium on the carnal desires of the petitioner.
 Court appeals to the Legislature:
 The bench said "The exemption of the husband on committal of such assault/rape, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, cannot be absolute, as no exemption in law can be so absolute that it becomes a license for commission of crime against society.Though the four corners of marriage would not mean society, it is for the legislature to delve upon the issue and consider tinkering of the exemption." 
 It added "This Court is not pronouncing upon whether marital rape should be recognized as an offence or the exception be taken away by the legislature. It is for the legislature, on an analysis of manifold circumstances and ramifications to consider the aforesaid issue. This Court is concerned only with the charge of rape being framed upon the husband alleging rape on his wife."
"For ages man donning the robes of a husband has used the wife as his chattel; but his crude behavior notwithstanding his existence because of a woman. The age old thought and tradition that the husbands are the rulers of their wives, their body, mind and soul should be effaced. It is only on this archaic, regressive and preconceived notion, the cases of this kind are mushrooming in the nation. Such sexual assault by a husband on his wife will have grave consequences on the mental sheet of the wife, it has both psychological and physiological impact on her. Such acts of husbands scar the soul of the wives", the Court observed.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that the prosecution must stand on its own legs based on its own evidence and that suspicion can't be allowed to take the place of proof even in a domestic inquiry.
The bench of Justice Siddhartha Varma observed thus as it set aside the dismissal order passed against an Uttar Pradesh police official for allegedly misbehaving with the private cook under the influence of alcohol.
The Court noted that even though the petitioner had not replied to the charges and had not appeared on the dates fixed when the inquiry was undergone, it was the bounden duty of the Enquiry Officer to have seen whether the charges were proved on the basis of the evidence which was led by it.
"There was only a medical report that there was a suspicion on account of the fact that there was a smell coming of alcohol from the petitioner while there was no blood report or urine report of the petitioner which actually would have proved that the petitioner had actually consumed liquor/alcohol to an extent that he was in a state of drunkenness," the Court added as it stressed that no eyewitnesses were examined in the case
The case in brief
The petitioner was suspended in July 2014, for the alleged incident and thereafter, a preliminary inquiry was undergone by a retired police officer, who found a prima facie case against the petitioner. 
On the basis of the preliminary report, the enquiry was allotted to the Additional Superintendent of Police, Rural, Jaunpur in June 2017. A charge sheet was prepared and handed over to the petitioner in August 2017. 
Enquiry report was submitted in April 2018 by the Enquiry Officer finding the petitioner guilty of the charges levied against him and a major punishment of removal was proposed under Rule 4(1) of the Uttar Pradesh Police Officers of the Subordinate Ranks (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1991. 
Thereafter, a show-cause notice was issued to the petitioner for his reply, upon receiving the notice, he submitted his reply in July 2018 and thereafter the punishment order was passed against the petitioner and he was removed from service in August 2018. 
The appeal filed by the petitioner was dismissed in October 2018 and similarly, the revision filed by him was also dismissed on January 2019. Aggrieved thereof, the petitioner had filed the instant writ petition.
It was contended by the petitioner is that the enquiry was a sham enquiry inasmuch as the enquiry was being undergone in Jaunpur and the petitioner was posted at Varanasi from where he was unable to get leave to attend the enquiry. It had been further stated that no eye-witness of the incident had been examined by the Enquiry Officer.
In view of this, noting that the impugned order of suspension can't be sustained in the eyes of law, the Court quashed and set aside the same.

While granting a decree of divorce to a couple, the Kerala High Court recently ruled that a wife making secret phone calls to a man ignoring her husband's warning against the same amounts to matrimonial cruelty.
Justice Kauser Edappagth in his judgment also observed that mere compromise would not amount to condonation of cruelty unless and until the matrimonial life was restored.
"Making discreet phone calls frequently by the wife with another man disregarding the warning of the husband, that too at odd hours, amounts to matrimonial cruelty."
It was also reiterated that to constitute cruelty, the conduct and behaviour of one spouse towards the other need only be of such a nature that it causes reasonable apprehension in the mind of the latter that it is not safe for him/her to continue the marital tie.
The Court was adjudicating upon a husband's appeal challenging the verdict of a Family Court. The husband had moved the Family Court seeking dissolution of marriage on the ground of adultery and cruelty, but it was dismissed. 
The husband's contention was that right from the inception of marriage, the wife has perpetrated various iniquitous acts making his life a living hell. It was also alleged that she has been maintaining an illicit relationship with the second respondent prior to her marriage and even thereafter.
Advocate T.M.Raman Kartha appearing for the husband further submitted that a perusal of the printout of CD produced from the BSNL would show that there were frequent calls between the wife and the second respondent, suggesting an unholy relationship between them.
Advocate M.B.Sandeep appearing for the wife disputed these claims and argued that she used to call the second respondent only occasionally that too for official purposes.
The Court noted that merely for the reason that the wife used to make regular calls to the second respondent, it could not jump to a conclusion that their relationship was an illicit one and that there was an adulterous act between them. 
It was further asserted that there must be a high degree of probability to substantiate the allegation of adultery. The evidence adduced by the husband was found to be insufficient to prove adultery even by a preponderance of probabilities. 
However, it was observed that there were instances where the wife made calls during odd hours as well. For instance, on 28/2/2013, she had made 10 calls out of which 5 were missed calls between 10.40 p.m to 10.55 p.m.
Justice Edappagath noted that although the said evidence is not sufficient to infer adultery on the part of the wife, the relevant question was whether making such calls would constitute mental cruelty. 
The Court further recalled that right from the inception of marriage, the marital relationship was not cordial. In fact, they separated three times and reunited and underwent mediation and conciliation several times. The parties had finally decided to resume cohabitation. In that circumstances, the wife should have been more vigilant in her behaviour, the Judge noted.
"According to the husband, she continued making calls with the second respondent in spite of his warning. It shows that even after the husband questioned the wife about her telephone conversation with the second respondent, and even after she realised that the husband did not like her making such telephone calls, she continued to make telephone conversation with the second respondent on almost all days, and several times on a single day," the judgment states.
The Single Bench also found it pertinent to note that during evidence, the wife had deposed that she used to call the second respondent only on certain days. 
However, documentary evidence proved otherwise. Therefore, the element of cruelty as alleged by the husband was satisfied in this case. 
Furthermore, both the husband and the wife accused each other of committing a breach of the compromise. 
"At any rate, it is not in dispute that there was breach of the compromise. The question is not who has committed the breach. The question is whether the compromise has been adhered to by both parties and whether there was normal resumption of conjugal relationship. Mere compromise would not amount to condonation of cruelty unless and until the matrimonial life was restored." 
There was absolutely no material on record to indicate the resumption of conjugal life in its true spirit between the husband and the wife after the compromise..
Under such circumstances, the Court found it to be a fit case to grant a divorce to the couple. 

The Kerala High Court recently held that the order issued by the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities to the Kerala Public Service Commission (KPSC) directing it to provide candidates with disabilities, who are participating in its selection process, with examination centres near their residences, was beyond the scope of its powers. 
The Single Judge Bench of Justice Shaji P. Chaly perused Sections 80-82 of the Right of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 which lays down the powers and functions of the State Commissioner to hold that the impugned order thus passed by the Commissioner was without any jurisdiction. 
"The Commissioner, in my view, is not a civil court, even though powers are conferred on the Commissioner to exercise the powers conferred on the civil court for summoning and enforcing the attendance of witnesses etc., and for other consequential aspects, in accordance with Section 82 of the Act, 2016. In that view of the matter, I am of the considered opinion that Ext.P1 order suffers from vice of arbitrariness and illegality, liable to be interfered with under Article 226 of the Constitution of India", it was observed.
The second respondent in the case, who is a differently abled person, had submitted an application for having an examination centre near the house of differently-abled persons before the local MLA, who in turn, had forwarded the same to the State Government. The State Government on its part, submitted the application to the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities. The State Commissioner subsequently issued a direction to the KPSC that candidates with disabilities, who are participating in the selection process of the KPSC ought to be provided with examination centres near their residences. It was specified that the order had been issued by virtue of the power conferred on the Commissioner as a civil court. 
The writ petition had thus been filed by the KPSC challenging this order. 
On perusing Section 80 of the Act, it was observed, 
"Merely because a power is conferred on the State Commissioner to follow the procedure contained under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 while trying a suit in respect to summoning and enforcing the attendance of witnesses; requiring production of documents and others, that does not mean that the Commissioner is exercising the substantive powers under the Act, 2016, as if, it is a civil court". 
The Court discerned that the powers of the Commissioner were confined to Section 80 of the Statute. It added that Section 81 further clarifies that whenever the State Commissioner makes a recommendation to an authority in pursuance of Clause (b) of Section 80 of the Act, 2016, that authority shall take necessary action on it, and inform the State Commissioner of the action taken within three months from the date of receipt of the recommendation. 
"The case put forth by the KPSC is that no notice was issued to the KPSC. When the representation submitted by the second respondent was forwarded by the State Government to the Commissioner, the Commissioner has unilaterally passed the order and issued the directions. On a perusal of Section 80, it is clear that the Commissioner under the Act, 2016 is not vested with any such powers. If the Commissioner wanted to consider the grievances highlighted in the representation submitted by the second respondent, it ought to have made a recommendation to the KPSC as empowered under Section 80 of the Act, 2016. Therefore, it is clear that the Commissioner has over reached the powers conferred on it under the Act, 2016", it found. 
It is in this context the Court found that the order suffered from illegality and arbitrariness, and thus quashed the same. 
"However, I make it clear that this will not stand in the way of the Commissioner for making any suitable recommendation to the KPSC, or the Government in order to protect the interest of persons with disabilities in the matter of their appearance in the selection process conducted by the KPSC", it added. 
The Standing Counsel for KPSC Advocate P.C. Sasidharan appeared on behalf of the petitioner. Senior Government Pleader Joby Joseph also appeared in the instant case.
Case Title: Kerala Public Service Commission v. The State Commissionerate for Persons with Disabilities & Anr. 

Punjab and Haryana High Court, while dealing with a writ petition against denial of compassionate appointment over 19 years delay, observed that compassionate appointment should not be treated as a "reservation" of any kind.
 The bench comprising Justice Arun Monga observed,
Trite it is to say that compassionate appointment is not to be treated as a reservation of any kind. It is merely benevolent measure undertaken by an employer to ameliorate the immediate penury of family members of a deceased employee, who dies in harness, and the family is visited with sudden and extreme hardship in the given situation where there is no other earning member in the family.
 It further added that death of the petitioner's father took place way back in 2003 and 19 years later, it cannot be the case of the sudden poverty which was in 2003.
 The court was dealing with a case where the father of the petitioner, was working on the post of Clerk in the Irrigation and Water Resources Department. On 28.03.2003, he died while in service. State notified the Haryana Compassionate Assistance to the Dependents of Deceased Government Employees Rules, 24 days before the death of petitioner's father. 
 Mother of the petitioner moved an application which was approved by the department. The petitioner who was 17-year old at the time of his father's death, became eligible to apply for the compassionate appointment within 3 years from the date of death of his father. 
 Thereafter, the State Government notified the Haryana Compassionate Assistance to the Dependents of Deceased Government Employees Rules, 2006 whereby choice was given to the dependents of Government employees whether they want to be covered under the Rules of 2003 or of 2006. Petitioner opted for Rules of 2003. 
 The petitioner filed a complaint in the CM Window in 2018 upon which an action taken report was received stating that the petitioner was not offered a job as right sizing of the jobs in the Department was done and that the petitioner was at Serial No.171 in terms of seniority for appointment. It was also mentioned that the petitioner was now covered under the Rules of 2006 and therefore, was entitled only for financial assistance. 
 The petitioner's mother received a letter from the office of Engineer-in-Chief to submit documents for claiming Compassionate Financial Assistance of Rs. 2.5 lakh. The petitioner was called for hearing and filed a complaint in the CM Window upon which action taken report was received stating that he cannot avail the benefit of Rules of 2003. 
 Considering the facts of the instant case, the court noted that the death of the petitioner's father took place in 2003 when he was only about 16-17 years. He became eligible on after almost three months and now 19 years later it cannot be said that the petitioner is suffering from sudden poverty with which they were struck in 2003.
"There is colossal delay on the part of the petitioner to approach this Court in the year 2022...entire delay is completely attributable to the petitioner and/ or his family members."
 However, the court noted that the widow of the deceased employee is entitled to ex gratia compensation along with applicable rate of interest payable w.e.f. the date of issuance of letter whereby widow of the deceased employee was asked to attend hearing in respect of compassionate assistance of Rs.2.5 lakh, till payment.
Case Title: Sudhir Kumar versus State of Haryana and others 

The Delhi High Court has rejected the petition filed by a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) militant Abdul Majeed Baba, who is serving life imprisonment in a UAPA case, for transfer from Tihar jail to his native state jail in Srinagar.
Justice Poonam Bamba however directed the Superintendent of Tihar Jail to ensure that requisite treatment and medical care be continued to be provided to Baba, who is 66 years old. Seeking transfer to Srinagar Central Jail, Baba had submitted that his health is deteriorating every day and his family members are unable to visit him from Kashmir.
Baba, a resident of Jammu & Kashmir, is lodged in a high risk ward in Central Jail, Tihar. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the offences under sections 120B, 121A, 122 and 123 of IPC and sections 17, 18, 20, 21 and 23 of UAPA. His conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court in February 2020.
Submitting that being close to his family would help him recover better, the counsel representing Baba argued that rules 664 and 672 of the Delhi Prison Rules provide for transfer of prisoners on humanitarian as well as medical grounds. Abdul's application for transfer had earlier been rejected by Delhi's Lieutenant Governor on September 24, 2021.
Baba's plea was opposed by the prosecution on the ground that he was a hard core militant of a banned terrorist organization JeM and had absconded during pendency of his appeal before High Court when he was released on bail. 
The court was informed that Abdul remained absconding for a long time and repeated non bailable warrants could not be executed for a period of six years from 2013 to 2019. The prosecution submitted that a reward of Rs. two lakhs was declared for his arrest after which he was arrested from Srinagar on May 11, 2019. 
There is every likelihood of Baba managing to flee from any other jail, considering his past conduct, the public prosecutor submitted. 
"The petitioner being a hard core militant of banned terrorist organization Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) his transfer may have law and order repercussions in both, the transferring and thereceiving state. The petitioner's request for transfer to Srinagar Jail was rightly declined after duly considering the above facts and circumstances as well as the past conduct of the convict," the State argued. 
Baba's counsel in response submitted that he could not surrender to the police as he was under constant treatment at a hospital in Srinagar.
The prosecution referred to a security advisory issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs of September 2015 for shifting of high risk prisoners from the jail of one state or union territory to another jail of a different state or union territory. 
Perusing the said advisory, the court noted that the government "has to be cautious" in transfer of high risk prisoners convicted in terror related cases taking into account the "security implications of such transfers in both, the transferring and the receiving state/UT."
"No doubt, Rules 664 and 672, Delhi Prison Rules, 2018 provide that the prisoner may be transferred from one prison to another on medical and humanitarian grounds with prior approval of the State Government. However, in view of the above facts and circumstances and taking into account the apprehension of law and order repercussions expressed by the State pursuant to evaluation of the security risk in transfer of the petitioner from Central Jail Tihar, Delhi to Srinagar Central Jail, this court is not inclined to grant the prayer of the petitioner," the court said. 
On Baba's concern regarding his ill health, the court noted that according to the report of the Medical Officer in Charge of Tihar jail dated September 6, he is being provided medical care and treatment.
"The Superintendent Jail is further directed to ensure that requisite treatment/medical care be continued to be provided to the petitioner. Petition is disposed of accordingly," the court said.

The Supreme Court has reiterated that intervention under Article 136 of the Constitution is not called for merely because a different view about the High Court's judgment is possible.
A bench comprising Justices Indira Banerjee and S Ravindra Bhat made this observation while dismissing an appeal challenging a judgment of the Kerala High Court in a case related to vesting of private forests (State of Kerala v. Popular Estates).
While declining interference with the factual findings entered by the High Court, the Supreme Court observed :
"There is some authority for the proposition that where two plausible views on the conclusions that can be drawn from facts on the record exist, this court, in exercise of its discretionary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution would not interfere with the findings of the High Court". 
In this regard, the judgment authored by Justice Ravindra Bhat referred to the precedents Pritam Singh v. The State 1950 SCR 453, Tirupati Balaji Developers Pvt. Ltd. v. Stateof Bihar (2004) 5 SCC 1, Jamshed Hormusji Wadia v. Board of Trustees, Port of Mumbai (2004) 3 SCC 214,  Union of India v. Gangadhar Narsingdas Agarwal & Anr (1997) 10 SCC 305,  Jai Mangal Oraon v. Mira Nayak (Smt) & Ors (2000) 5 SCC 141.
Article 136 - Direct Appeal From HC Single Bench Orders Maintainable In Cases Of 'Glaring Errors & Injustices' : Supreme Court 
The Court observed :
"...in Union of India v. Gangadhar Narsingdas Agarwal & Anr, this court, declining to interfere with the order of the High Court in exercise of its power under Article 136 of the Constitution, said that even if two views are possible, the view taken by the High Court being a plausible one, it would not call for intervention by this court. A similar view was expressed in Jai Mangal Oraon v. Mira Nayak (Smt) & Ors, wherein this court held that when there was nothing illegal and wrong in the reasoning and conclusions arrived at by the High Court and it appeared to be merited and in accordance with the interpretation of statutory provisions, this court would not interfere with the order of the High Court under Article 136 of the Constitution"
The judgment quoted from Taherakhatoon (D) By Lrs. v.Salambin Mohammad  (1992) 2 SCC 635 as follows : 
"...even though we are now dealing with the appeal after grant of special leave, we are not bound to go into merits and even if we do so and declare the law or point out the error- still we may not interfere if the justice of the case on facts does not require interference or if we feel that the relief could be moulded in a different fashion."

Coram: Justices Indira Banerjee and SR Bhat

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that mere denial of counter signature on a certificate in absence of proper enquiry or finding does not warrant major punishment of termination of service, which becomes punitive in nature particularly when the order of termination is not simpliciter but the stigma is attached to the same.
The observations were made by Justice Wasim Sadiq Nargal while deciding a bunch of petitions in terms of which the petitioners had challenged their order of termination issued by the Chief Engineer Project beacon C/O 56 APO. 
In the instant case the petitioner got appointed to the post of Nursing Assistant however post the selection process, a verification process was initiated by the appointing authority in order to determine the genuineness of the documents submitted by the selected candidates. 
Subsequently , it came to fore that the experience certificate of the petitioner was alleged to be forged and as a consequence of which, a Notice of termination came to be issued on September 26th 2009 against the petitioner by the Chief Engineer, Beacon. 
On October 14th, 2009 a reply to the notice was submitted by the petitioner and on the basis of recommendations on October 23 2009, the notice of termination was withdrawn in respect of petitioner, for the purpose of directing further enquiry with respect to the same. 
On further enquiry the verification certificate was endorsed by Mahajan Hospital in respect of petitioner and it was verified by them that the petitioner had gained the requisite experience in their hospital and the certificate was genuine. However, on May 30th 2011, another order of termination was passed against the petitioner No. 1, whereby, he was given one month notice for termination of his services on 30th June 2011.
Challenging his order of termination the petitioner submitted that he responded to his first termination order through proper channel and clarified the position that the experience certificate furnished by him is not forged but true and correct one and before appointment of the petitioner has a working experience as a Nursing Assistant with the Mahajan Hospital Salapur Maharashtra.
The petitioners further argued that they have not furnished or made any declaration which is false or suppressed any material fact. 
Contesting the plea, the respondents vehemently argued that the point which has been raised by the petitioner with regard to the relevancy of experience certificate, is false and that the genuineness of experience certificate is in question, as the same has been intimated as “FORGED” by the concerned authority (Counter Signing Authority).
Respondents further submitted that after recruitment of candidates for the appropriate posts, GREF Centre (Recruiting Centre), verifies the genuineness of the certificates produced by the candidates. Accordingly, the experience certificate was verified by GREF Centre from District Health Officer, Health Deptt. Zilla Parishad, Slapur and the District Health Officer, Health Deptt. Zilla Parishad Solapur has intimated vide letter No. ZPS/Health/PUB/196/09 dated 09 July 2009, that their office has not countersigned or issued the said certificate to petitioner, respondents averred. 
Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Nargal observed that a counter signature is an additional signature added to a document that has already been signed and the counter signature serves to provide reconfirmation of the document’s authenticity. 
Pointing out to the contradictions, the court said that the hospital authorities who have first-hand knowledge of the fact that the petitioner has worked with them are validating and verifying the same, however, the countersigning authority is denying the same on the ground that the said authority has not countersigned the experience certificate and the same is forged by the petitioner. 
"Even if the allegations leveled against the petitioner are taken to its logical conclusion, this Court cannot lose sight of the fact that the documents already stand proved and verified to the extent of signing as well as verified by the issuing authority", the bench recorded. 
Pointing out to the fact that the initial termination order and the final order were based on the same order of denial by of District Health Officer the court said that the only communication post the withdrawal for further investigation, was that of hospital, wherein the said hospital authorities have confirmed about the authenticity and validity of the experience certificate, therefore, it can safely be concluded that the investigation conducted by the respondents is in favor of petitioner No.1 and thus, there was no justification on part of the respondents to issue the second termination order on the same grounds.
Rejecting the argument of the respondent that the signature of DHO has been denied and is alleged to be forged the court said that it must be borne in mind that a mere denial will not suffice the purpose in absence of any enquiry or finding recorded by the respondents.
"The bar of proving forgery is high and must be supported by sufficient evidence and in absence of any detailed enquiry conducted in this regard, it cannot be assumed that the documents has been forged by the petitioner No.1", the bench explained. 
Observing that the validity of the certificate has not been denied by the issuing authority, the court maintained that it is only the counter signature which is denied by the respondents and mere denial of counter signature on a certificate in absence of proper enquiry or finding recorded in this regard does not warrant major punishment of termination of service. 
Elaborating further on the matter Justice Nargal observed that the allegations leveled against the petitioner No.1 were never enquired into by conducting a detailed enquiry or associating the petitioner by providing him an opportunity of being heard and in absence of that, it cannot be assumed that the petitioner is guilty of producing forged document which can be basis for passing the order of termination.
Finding the order of termination disproportionate to the attributed misconduct and the court said the same necessarily warrants the interference of the Court. Accordingly the bench allowed the petition and the impugned notice was quashed to the extent of petitioner No.1 only. The respondents were further directed to allow the petitioner to perform his duties as Nursing Assistant without any hindrance.

"Undoubtedly, pension is not an act of bounty, but is towards the service which has been rendered by an employee. However, in evaluating a claim for compassionate appointment, it is open to the authorities to evaluate the financial position of the family upon the death while in service", the Supreme Court has observed.
"Compassionate appointment is not a vested right. It is provided in order to enable a family to tide over a financial crisis caused by the death of its wage-earner while in service. If the scheme requires that the family pension must be taken into account in evaluating the merits of an application, it has to be followed...Compassionate appointment is not a matter of right, but is to enable the family to tide over an immediate crisis which may result from the death of the employee. If the policy of the government envisages that the family pension would be paid for a ten years after which it would have to be modified, it cannot be said that by taking into account the present pensionary payment, the authorities have considered an extraneous circumstance. The same criterion is applied even handedly to all applicants seeking compassionate appointment",
 the court has held.

 was hearing an appeal against April, 2018 judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Madras, affirming the judgment and order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, directing the appellants to reconsider the claim of the respondent for appointment on compassionate grounds for a post corresponding to her qualifications against vacancies for 2014-15. The spouse of the respondent was holding the rank of Sargent in the Indian Air Force. During the course of his employment, he died due to cancer on 6 January 2008, leaving behind the respondent and two minor children. An application was filed by the respondent seeking compassionate appointment, but, it was rejected on 17 February 2011. A subsequent application which was filed on 11 February 2014 was also rejected on 16 June 2015 on the ground that the respondent had secured merit points which did not enable her to obtain compassionate appointment. The Union of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (Department of Personnel and Training) issued an OM2 on 9 October 1998 titled "Scheme of Compassionate Appointment under the Central Government". On 22 January 2010, the Government of India in the Ministry of Defence issued an OM4 titled "Scheme of Compassionate Appointment Relative Merit, Point and Revised Procedure for Selection". This was followed by another OM5 of the MoD dated 14 May 2010.
Following the death of her husband, the respondent was in the receipt of a family pension in the amount of Rs 8,265 per month. The total terminal benefits which were paid to the respondent were in the amount of Rs 22,91,568. The case of the respondent for compassionate appointment was evaluated and merit points were assigned under various heads in terms of the procedure which was prescribed by the MoD. The respondent, however, submitted that the family pension at the above rate was payable from 7 January 2008 to 6 January 2018, after which the amount of pension would stand reduced to Rs 4,959 per month. On this basis, the respondent submitted before the Tribunal that she should have been awarded 16 merit points instead of 10 against the head of family pension. The Tribunal observed that the denial of compassionate appointment on the ground that the respondent was drawing a monthly pension of Rs 8,265 on the date of consideration of the case was not justifiable as pension is paid for the service rendered by a deceased employee. Moreover, the Tribunal noted that the quantum of pension would stand reduced with effect from 7 January 2018 to Rs 4,959 per month and since the deceased employee had died due to a terminal illness, the family "might be in debt" and "might have sold the property for his treatment", while, at the same time, observing that it was not going into those aspects. On this basis, the letter of rejection was quashed and the appellants were directed to reconsider the case. The High Court, while affirming the judgment of the Tribunal, has held that the authorities have erred in taking into account the family pension in the monthly income, since this was an ad hoc income earned by the respondent, instead of considering the regular pension which would be earned with effect from 7 January 2018."While assessing the rival submissions, it becomes necessary, at the outset, to consider the reasons which weighed with the Tribunal since it is the view of the Tribunal which has been held not to suffer from error by the High Court. Under the policy document, which embodies the Scheme for considering cases for compassionate appointment, points are awarded under diverse heads. The monthly pension which was payable to the respondent was required to be taken into account in the award of merit points. The Tribunal, however, came to the conclusion that pension is paid for past service rendered by the employee and, hence, denial of compassionate appointment on that basis was not justifiable. This reasoning of the Tribunal is fallacious",
 the bench has held.It goes on to assert, "If the scheme requires that the family pension must be taken into account in evaluating the merits of an application, it has to be followed. In the present case, the family pension which was payable as on the date of the consideration of the application has been taken into account. The fact that the pension would be up for revision in terms of the policy after a decade was not a reason to discard the pensionary payment which was being made towards family pension on the date of the consideration of the application for compassionate appointment."
"The High Court has affirmed the view of the Tribunal by coming to the conclusion that the payment which was being made to the respondent was ad hoc in nature and was wrongly considered by the authorities while awarding merit points. This line of reasoning of the High Court is equally erroneous as that of the Tribunal. The payment of the family pension was not an ad hoc amount, but, was evidently in accordance with the applicable service rules. The application of the respondent was initially rejected in 2011 and was, thereafter, again reconsidered in 2014. Absent a case of palpable arbitrariness, we are of the view that there was no reason for the High Court or the Tribunal to interfere with the evaluation which was conducted by the authorities in terms of the applicable guidelines. Moreover, we are clearly of the view that the grant of compassionate appointment would not be in accordance with the basic purpose and object of such a scheme. For the above reasons, we allow the appeals and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 26 April 2018. The OA6 filed by the respondent shall, in the circumstances, stand dismissed", held the bench.
Case Title: UOI v. Amrita Sinha

Noting that several tribals were denied supplies under the Public Distribution System due to the non-linking of their Aadhar Cards, even as the fortunates eagerly awaited Diwali, the Bombay High Court ordered the Tehsildar of Murbad to distribute supplies to nearly 90 tribals by November 4.

Noting that several tribals were denied supplies under the Public Distribution System due to the non-linking of their Aadhar Cards, even as the fortunates eagerly awaited Diwali, the Bombay High Court ordered the Tehsildar of Murbad to distribute supplies to nearly 90 tribals by November 4.  
 In an interim order, Justices Prasanna Varale and Madhav Jamdar observed no logic, reason or rationale for denying the benefits of distribution of food grains under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) to the tribals on raising certain technical grounds.
 The court ordered the distribution of food grains to tribal beneficiaries under NFSA and Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, after verifying their ration cards.
  "It is a disheartening situation for us when we the fortunates are eagerly awaiting as the festive season is approaching and the festival of lights would spread joy and happiness in the society throughout the State or the whole nation, here are the few petitioners who are the members of the marginalised section in general and tribals in particular who have approached this Court on a grievance that they are deprived of the basic requirement of human life, i.e., food, only on account that the State machinery is not technically equipped to give them the benefits flowing from the scheme formulated and floated by the Union of India and to be implemented and executed by the respective States."
 The State claimed that Aadhaar cards linked to a different place than the residence of these individuals were the reason behind non-distribution. However, the court noted that illiterate tribals approach ration shop owners to link their Aadhar cards to the portal. 
 "…if a mistake is committed by shop owner, the same cannot be the reason for denial of food grains to the ration cardholder under the benevolent schemes," the court noted.
 State Can Also use ration Card to Identify Beneficiary 
 The State also cited a government circular from October 2013. According to the circular, the Aadhar of every family member in the ration card must be linked to the portal for the benefits of PDS.
 However, the court observed that the requirements are in stark opposition to a central government notification dated February 8 2017, which clearly states that the Aadhaar Card is only one of the criteria for identifying the Beneficiary, not the sole criteria.
 "There is another document on which the beneficiary can rely upon to receive the benefits of the scheme, and that is "ration card" issued by the State of Union Territory Administration, Food Department."
 Even If One Member's Aadhar Linked, Entire Family Eligible for Food 
 The court observed that according to clause 5 of the centre's notification, any member of an eligible household listed in the ration card shall be entitled to receive the entire quantity of cash transfer or food subsidy under NFSA, if even one member fulfils the identification conditions, in case of Aadhaar number is not yet assigned to all.
 The court relied on the Supreme Court's observations in K. S. Puttaswamy v/s. Union of India (2019) 1 SCC 1, popularly known as "Aadhaar Card Judgment." The court held that beneficial schemes are not charity or doles and that technology shall not be a rider to implement beneficial schemes.
 "Our quest for technology should be oblivious to the country's real problems; social exclusion, impoverishment and marginalisation. The Aadhar project suffers from crucial design flaws which impact upon its structural probity. Structural design in delivering welfare entitlements must be compliant with structural due process, to be in accord with Articles 14 and 21," the court observed quoting the judgement.
 Regarding the case at hand, the court said the beneficiaries were tribals, majority of them being illiterate. "As such, they rely on the action taken by the respective ration shop owner, and in such case, if a mistake is committed by shop owner, the same cannot be the reason for denial of food grains to the ration card holder under the benevolent schemes," the court said. 
 A social worker overlooking the case of the tribals told Live Law that over half of tribals in 22 sectors had received food grains. However, only the list of names provided to authorities was looked into. 
 "The court had ordered aide to be given to similarly placed tribals as well. However, that is yet to happen," the social worker said. 

The Delhi High Court has said that forums created under The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 are "neither obliged nor placed under a duty" to render categorical findings with respect to the civil rights which are claimed by parties. 
"The primordial consideration of those proceedings is to safeguard the interest of the senior citizens and to ensure that they are not harassed or ill-treated in their twilight years," said Justice Yashwant Varma.
The court was dealing with a writ petition challenging the Appellate Authority's order by which the prayer, for placing the order of District Magistrate in abeyance during the hearing of an appeal, was rejected.
The petitioner's counsel argued that in light of the pending civil suit and the rights claimed by her in the property, the Divisional Commissioner, who is the appellate authority, clearly erred in proceeding to reject the application for stay. It was also argued that since the appeal was entertained, there was no justification for refusal of stay.
Justice Varma said no interference is warranted with the order and referred to his earlier decision in Virender Singh vs. PR Secretary Cum Divisional Commissioner & Ors.
"Since learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to point out any material perversity in the order that was passed by the District Magistrate and which had constrained it to frame directions for eviction, the Court finds no ground to interfere with the impugned order. While arriving at the aforesaid conclusion, the Court has also weighed in mind the principles which were enunciated in Virendra Singh and have been extracted hereinabove," said the court.
Title: MANISH GUPTA vs GOVT OF NCT OF DELHI & ORS

The Supreme Court, in a judgment delivered on Wednesday (9 Nov 2022), explained the method to determine the compensation for use and occupation of the tenancy premises by a tenant who suffered an eviction decree.
From the date of the decree of eviction, the tenant is liable to pay mesne profits or compensation for use and occupation of the premises at the same rate at which the landlord would have been able to let out the premises and earn rent if the tenant would have vacated the premises, the bench of Justices MR Shah and MM Sundresh observed.
In this case, while admitting the revision application preferred by the tenant, who is aggrieved of the eviction decree , the High Cour directed the Tenant to deposit Rs. 2,50,000/- per month towards compensation as a condition of stay. To arrive at this figure, the High Court considered the amount paid by the purchaser of the property in question (Sumer Corporation). Thus the Corporation challenged this order before the Apex Court.
Disagreeing with this method adopted by the High Court, the Apex Court bench, by referring to the decision in Atma Ram Properties (P) Ltd. Vs. Federal Motors (P) Ltd., (2005) 1 SCC 705 and State of Maharashtra and Anr. Vs. SuperMax International Private Limited and Ors., (2009) 9 SCC 772., observed: 
"If the approach adopted by the High Court is accepted and/or approved, in a given case, it may happen that the lessor might have purchased the property forty years back and/or long back and if the said approach is considered and thereafter the monthly compensation is determined, the same cannot be said to be a reasonable compensation...As observed and held by this Court in the case of Atma Ram Properties (P) Ltd. (supra), from the date of the decree of eviction, the tenant is liable to pay mesne profits or compensation for use and occupation of the premises at the same rate at which the landlord would have been able to let out the premises and earn rent if the tenant would have vacated the premises. The landlord is not bound by the contractual rate of rent effective for the period preceding the date of the decree."
The bench observed that the High Court was required to determine the compensation at the same rate at which the landlord would have been able to let out the premises and earn rent if the tenant would have vacated the premises. The court, while remanding the case back to High Court, observed thus:
In a revision / appeal preferred by the tenant, who has suffered an eviction decree, the appellate / revisional court while staying the eviction decree can direct the tenant to pay the compensation for use and occupation of the tenancy premises upon the contractual rate of rent and such compensation for use and occupation of the premises would be at the same rate at which the landlord would have been able to let out the premises and earn rent if the tenant would have vacated the premises.

Observing that a child witness, by reason of his/her tender age, is a pliable witness and is amenable to tutoring and inducement, the Bombay High Court has acquitted a man convicted for raping a victim less than five year old.
 Justice Anuja Prabhudessai, disbelieving the child witness testimony before the trial court, as well as casting doubt on the child's mother's deposition, observed,
"It is well known that a child witness, by reason of his/her tender age is a pliable witness. He/she is amenable to tutoring and inducement and is often prone to telling imaginative and exaggerated stories. Hence the evidence of a child witness needs to be scrutinized with extreme care and caution."
 The court, after going through the trial records with respect to the victim child's testimony noted that she had herself admitted during the cross-examination to being a tutored witness "and hence no implicit reliance can be placed on her evidence."
 "She (the victim) has admitted in her cross examination that her parents were present at the time of recording her statement under Section 164 of Cr.P.C.. She has stated that her parents had told her how to give the statement. She has further stated that she was questioned by the police about the incident and that her mother had given the answers, which were taken down in writing. She has admitted that her parents had told her how to depose before the Court," noted Justice Prabhudessai.
 The court was hearing an appeal against conviction by a resident of Thane on a complaint filed by the mother of the victim – all of them residents of the same building. The petitioner was convicted in 2019 under sections 376 (punishment for rape) and 354 (A) (1) (i) (for physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 4 (punishment for penetrative sexual assault) and 8 (punishment for sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
 The accusation was that, in December 2017, when the victim and her friends were playing bat and ball on the 5th floor (the floor on which the accused used to reside, a floor above the victim), the accused took them to his room and offered them chocolates. He then sent her friends out of the room, closed the door, made her lie down on the bed, removed her pant and touched her private parts. He then told her not to disclose the incident to her mother.
 The doctor's deposition too was against the prosecution's case. She told the court that there were no injuries on the private parts of the victim and that "everything was normal." The medical evidence, therefore, too ruled out the possibility of insertion of finger in the victim's vagina.
 The accused, who used to live with his wife and two children had pleaded that his house was just above the house of the victim's and that there was a quarrel between them over leakage of water from his toilet. Therefore, he was falsely implicated in the case. The HC believed in this defence of his and observed that the trial court had held the accused guilty of all offences solely on the basis of the statement of the victim, who was a child of five years of age, but had not taken into consideration these material omissions and discrepancies, which render the evidence of the child unreliable and the possibility of material improvement in the victim's evidence.
Case Title: Janaradhan Pandurang Kapse v. State of Maharashtra

The Delhi High Court has asked its Registrar General to expeditiously implement a 2018 verdict wherein he was requested to explore the possibility of creation of a database for district courts to ensure preservation of right of default bail of the accused. 
Justice Anu Malhotra referred to the observations made in Arvind Kumar Saxena v. State wherein she had requested the Registrar General to create the database on various dates in relation to pending remand applications before the trial courts, the dates of arrest and by when the chargesheet is to be filed or has been filed.
The court in the 2018 verdict had observed that such a database or software would enable the trial courts to inform the accused appearing before them that they are entitled to the indefeasible right of default bail and may exercise the same if he or she is willing to furnish bail.
"It is, however, expected by this Court that the observations of this Court in Arvind Kumar Saxena V. State; a verdict dated 14.3.2018 in Bail Appln. No. 2238/2017 referred to herein above vide paragraph 18 are expeditiously explored to be implemented by the Registrar General of this Court," Justice Malhotra said in an order passed on Monday. 
The direction came while the court denied bail to a Nepal national Sher Singh in the 2020 espionage case in which freelance journalist Rajeev Sharma is a prime accused. 
Singh, as per his plea, had come to India to find a job to cater to his family's needs and was an office peon-cum-driver in MZ Mall Private Limited, which had Chinese nationals in the management. His lawyer told the court that his role was to clean the office, drive a vehicle and deliver or pick packages as per specific directions of the company management.
The court was told that while co-accused availed default bail under Section 167(2) of the CrPC, Singh could not avail the same as he could not afford to hire any advocate for his defence. It was also submitted that while co-accused were arrested by the Enforcement Directorate, the central agency did not arrest him.
Justice Malhotra said Singh admittedly "had not chosen" to seek the grant of default bail. 
"It is rightly held vide order dated 20.5.2022 of the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge-05, New Delhi declining the prayer made by the applicant seeking the grant of bail observing to the effect that there is no parity between the applicant and the co-accused Rajeev Sharma and Qing Shi granted default bail under Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C., 1973," said the bench.
On merits, the court said "in view of the gravity of the offence affecting the national security of the country, there is no ground for grant of bail and the bail application is declined." 
The Case
The FIR was registered by the Special Cell under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Official Secrets Act, 1983 and Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. As per the prosecution, a secret input was received from an intelligence agency that Sharma had links with a foreign intelligence officer and had been receiving funds from his handler through illegal means and Western Union money transfer platform.
During investigation, Sharma was arrested and several articles including some sensitive and confidential documents related to the Indian Defence Department were allegedly recovered during a search at his home. 
Sharma is accused of conveying secret and confidential information to Chinese Intelligence Officers and receiving remuneration through shell companies like MZ Mall Private Limited and MZ Pharmacy Private Limited.
Later, co accused Qing Shi, a Chinese national and Sher Singh, the applicant, were also arrested. According to the police, Singh was a co-director of one of the companies. Sharma allegedly was being funded through these shell companies on the directions of Chinese Intelligence Officers.
Accused Rajeev Sharma and Qing Shi were granted bail by the High Court in December 2020 and July 2021, respectively, under Section 167(2) of the CrPC.
Title: SHER SINGH @ RAJ BOHARA v. STATE (NCT OF DELHI)

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Thursday reiterated that in order to ascertain the claims of juvenility, courts should give priority to the certificate issued by the educational institution other than play school which was firstly attended by the accused.
 The observations came from a bench comprising Justices M A Chowdhary while hearing a revision petition against order of Additional Sessions Judge which upheld Magistrate's decision that the petitioner/appellant was not a juvenile.
 Counsel for the petitioner argued that both the Courts below had decided the juvenility of the petitioner as an accused, based on the record of the Chowkidar of the village and did not rely upon the school certificate issued in favour of the petitioner/accused which enjoys primacy over other records.
 Adjudicating upon the matter, Justice Chowdhary observed that law on the subject mandates that priority must be given to the certificate issued by the educational institution other than play school which was firstly attended by the accused, to ascertain the claim of juvenility.
 In order to buttress the said position of law the bench placed firm reliance on the Supreme Court judgement in Vijay Singh V/s State of Delhi 2012 wherein it was held that in the claim of juvenility, first priority is given to the matriculation certificate or equivalent certificate, second priority is to be given to the date of birth certificate issued from school (other than play School) first attended and in absence of other certificates, the certificate issued by Municipality or Panchayat.
 Applying the law in vogue to the matter at hand, the bench observed that in the instant case the accused was shown to have his date of birth as 20.08.1996, as recorded in the Government (Boys) High School Bari Brahmana Jammu, which he had attended first and therefore the date of birth issued by the said school should have been relied upon and date of birth of the petitioner/accused should have been accepted as 20.08.1996.
 Explaining further the court said that having regard to this proposition, both the Courts below committed error by not accepting the date of birth as shown in the school record which had also been proved during the inquiry. The age of the petitioner should have been accepted as 20.08.1996 based on the school record, having primacy over other documents as against the record of village Chowkidar, the bench underscored.
 "Therefore, the petitioner/accused as on the date of commission of the offence was below the age of 18 years and was a juvenile within the definition of Juvenile Justice Act and his trial, in any case, could have been conducted only by Juvenile Justice Board and not by a regular Sessions Court", the court maintained.
 For the foregoing reasons the court allowed the petition and the case against the petitioner was ordered to be transferred to the Juvenile Justice Board Jammu, for further proceedings.
 Case Title : Sanjay Raina Vs State of J&K & Ors.

The Delhi High Court has observed that no Court can compel a party to file documents on which the party did not choose to rely, save and except in respect of certain specific eventualities for which provisions are contained in the Code of Civil Procedure. 
Justice C Hari Shankar added that in any litigation, the choice of the documents which are to be brought on record is the sole prerogative of the party who files the documents.
The Court was dealing with a plea challenging orders dated 8th July, 2021 and 6th May, 2022, passed by the Additional District Judge in a civil suit. 
The order dated 8th July, 2021 rejected an application filed by the petitioner, as the defendant in in the suit, seeking dismissal of the suit under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC. Towards the conclusion of the impugned order, the ADJ directed the respondent to file two documents. 
The subsequent order dated 6th May, 2022 disposed of an application, filed by the petitioner under sec. 151 of the CPC, seeking a direction to the respondent-plaintiff to comply with the order dated 8th July, 2021 "in its true spirit" and, accordingly, to extend the time available with the petitioner to file written statement. 
The ADJ had vide the second impugned, held that the respondent had complied with the directions contained in the first impugned order regarding filing of documents, and had extended the time available with the petitioner to file written statement in the suit by a period of four weeks from 6th May, 2022.
During the pendency of the suit, the petitioner-defendant filed an application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC, which stood dismissed by the first impugned order. 
The counsel appearing for the petitioner had restricted the challenge qua the impugned order dated 8th July, 2021, which rejected the said application, predicated on sec. 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.
The High Court thus observed reiterated that the scope of examination by the Court exercising jurisdiction under Order VII Rule 11 has necessarily to peregrinate at all times, within the boundaries of the plaint and the averments contained therein, read with the documents filed with the plaint, and cannot venture any further.
"Even if that were so, however, the Court could not examine such documents while adjudicating on an application under Order VII Rule 11. The Court, to reiterate yet again, can only examine the averments in the plaint and the documents filed with the plaint," the Court said. 
The Court was also of the view that neither would the impugned order, nor would the judgment, inhibit the petitioner from retaining the right, at any subsequent stage of the suit and in accordance with law, to press for dismissal of the suit as being barred by sec. 53A of the Transfer of Property Act. 
"For these reasons, no fault can be found with the impugned order dated 8th July, 2021, insofar as it rejects the petitioner's application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC. The order is, therefore, upheld in its entirety," the Court said. 
It added "No exception can, in my view, therefore, be taken to the finding of the learned ADJ, in the second impugned order dated 6th May, 2022, to the extent it holds that no further directions were required to be issued, to the respondent, for complying with the directions contained in the first impugned order dated 8th July, 2021."
The plea was accordingly disposed of. 
Case Title: KRISHAN KAKKAR v. KIRAN CHANDER

The Bombay High Court recently granted bail to a man accused of raping a minor girl observing that the two were in a relationship and the girl, though minor, understood the consequences of her act. The girl was 15 years and 4 months old while the accused was about 21 years old at the time of the alleged incident.
 "It appears that the applicant though minor, was capable of understanding the consequences of her act and she voluntarily accompanied the applicant to her aunt's place," Justice Bharati Dangre noted in her order.
 On April 29, 2021 the prosecutrix disclosed the incident to her family after her sister found her chatting with the applicant on WhatsApp. Her mother filed a criminal complaint against the accused.
 The applicant was arrested last year for offences under Sections 363, 376, and 506 of IPC and sections 4, 8 and 12 of the POCSO Act.
 In her statement, the prosecutrix said that she and the applicant were in a relationship. According to her statement, on April 6, 2021, she went with the applicant to his aunt's house in Govandi where he committed sexual intercourse with her without her consent and threatened her not to disclose the incident to anyone. 
 After going through the charge sheet, the court said that while minor's consent is immaterial, she was capable of understanding the consequences of her act and she voluntarily accompanied the applicant to his aunt's place. 
"In a case like this, where she voluntarily joined the company of the applicant, and she had categorically admitted that she was in love with the applicant, whether that she consented for the sexual intercourse or not, is the matter of evidence," the court said.
Continuing, the court said, "Till what point of time, she accompanied the applicant and whether she resisted the actual physical indulgence, when according to her, the applicant forcibly committed sexual intercourse with her against her wishes, will have to be determined".
 The court further noted that she kept quiet about the alleged incident until her family objected to her WhatsApp chat with the applicant. 
"The time gap between these two events is also crucial as it was always open for the prosecutrix to disclose the aunt about the forcible act if it was committed in her house, but she continued to remain silent and disclosed the incident only when an objection was taken for she establishing contact with the applicant," the court said.
 The court added that the applicant is a young boy and it cannot rule out "the possibility of him being smitten by infatuation". It further observed that the trial may take considerable time and he doesn't need to be further incarcerated "though he may take the consequences of the accusations levelled against him".
 Therefore, the court granted bail to the applicant on the condition that he will not contact or attempt to contact the prosecutrix either physically or virtually, and move away from the area where the prosecutrix resides.

 Case Title – Faizan Wahid Baig v. State of Maharashtra

In a significant observation, the Allahabad High Court recently deprecated the practice of police officers questioning rape victims regarding variations in their statements given under Section 161 (Examination of witnesses by police) and 164 (Recording of confessions and statements) of the Code Of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The Bench of Justice Samit Gopal specifically...
In a significant observation, the Allahabad High Court recently deprecated the practice of police officers questioning rape victims regarding variations in their statements given under Section 161 (Examination of witnesses by police) and 164 (Recording of confessions and statements) of the Code Of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).
 The Bench of Justice Samit Gopal specifically observed that putting questions to the prosecutrix/victim with regards to the change in the version by her in the statements under Section 161 of the Code and in the statement under Section 164 of the Code, clearly shows disrespect to the courts who have recorded the statements under Section 164 of the Code.
 The Court further observed that the purpose of recording such supplementary statements is only and solely for frustrating the purpose of statements recorded under Section 164 of CrPC and to negate and defeat the earlier statement of the prosecutrix/victim given under section 164 of CrPC.
 Against this backdrop, the Court directed the Director General of Police, Uttar Pradesh Lucknow to look into the said new trend of Investigation as adopted and issue suitable guidelines for such matter so that the sanctity and authority of judicial proceedings are maintained and they should not be frustrated by any act done during Investigation.
 The matter in brief 
 The Court was hearing three bail applications, argued on a particular issue common in all of them, however, the Court did not go into the merits of the cases, and rather dealt with a specific question, which is as follows:
 "Whether the Investigating Officer of a case, can, after recording the statement of a prosecutrix/victim once under Section 161 of CrPC who has supported the prosecution case and then in her statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code recorded before a Magistrate has given a different version and more particularly does not state about any wrongful act being committed on her as has been recorded in her statement under Section 161 of the Code earlier, can again interrogate the prosecutrix/victim under Section 161 of the Code and put specific questions to her pertaining to the two different versions given by her in the said two statements and then record the statements and proceed with the Investigation further?"
Essentially, the Court was concerned with the question as to whether a police officer can question/interrogate a rape victim again, who first supported the case of prosecution alleging rape in her statement recorded under 161 CrPC, but later on, gives a different version and more particularly does not state about any wrongful act being committed in her statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code before the Magistrate.
 In all the three matters being dealt with by the court, the investigating officers had done the same activity during the investigation, that is, they had recorded the statement of the prosecutrix/victims again under Section 161 of CrPC by putting specific questions to the victims with regards to the said variations (161 and 164 CrPC statements) and recorded the answers to the said questions.
 Court's observations
 At the outset, the Court observed that under Section 164 of CrPC, the statement of a victim is recorded by Judicial Magistrates in the discharge of their judicial functions and therefore, the act of the Investigating Officer putting a question to the victim as to why she gave out a different version before the magistrate (in comparison to her statement under 161) is not appreciable.
 The Court further remarked that the statement made by the prosecutrix/victim under section 164 CrPC before the Magistrate stands on a high pedestal and sanctity during the course of investigation than that of her statement recorded under section 161 of CrPC by the Investigating Officer.
 Further, underscoring that the act of recording of the said statements was a judicial act which was performed by a public servant while discharging his judicial functions, the Court observed thus:
 "By putting questions to the prosecutrix/victim in her second statement under Section 161 of the Code after recording of the statement under Section 164 of the Code relating to the different versions in the said two statements, the Investigating Officer cannot frustrate the same and also make an attempt to make the purpose of the said exercise look a farce…The act of putting specific questions pertaining to the variations in the said two statements by the Investigating Officer is viewed with an impression of clearly challenging the authority of a judicial act. The Investigating Officers have clearly exceeded their jurisdiction by proceedings to investigate in such a manner. The same appears to be with a sole purpose to frustrate the statements recorded by a Magistrate."
 Lastly, the Court directed the DGP to issue necessary guidelines within a period of one month and also asked the state counsels and registry to submit a compliance report within one week thereafter.
 In so far as the bail applications were concerned, the court directed that the matters be detagged with each other and be listed on October 25, 2021, as fresh before the appropriate Bench for consideration.

The Supreme Court reiterated that a Court must be satisfied that the dying declaration is true and voluntary, and only then could it be the sole basis for conviction without corroboration.
In this case, the Karnataka High Court reversed the acquittal recorded by the Trial Court and convicted the accused in a murder case. To convict them, the High Court relied on the dying declaration made by the deceased.
In appeal, the court noted the following factors (i) interpolation in the dying declaration (ii) contradiction in the statements of prosecution witnesses regarding injuries on the palm, (iii) the victim with 80% injuries was apparently not in a situation to talk or give statement, (iv) PW-2, son of the deceased himself has stated that his mother committed suicide as she could not bear that her another son had been sent to jail, (v) there being no corroborative evidence to the statement , and (vi) there is no other evidence led by the prosecution to connect the appellants with the crime except the statement.
Referring to a few precedents on the subject [ P.V. Radhakrishna. v. State of Karnataka (2003) 6 SCC 443 , Sham Shankar Kankaria v. State of Maharashtra (2006) 13 SCC 165, Chacko v. State of Kerala 2003) 1 SCC 112, Surinder Kumar v. State of Haryana (2011) 10 SCC 173], the bench comprising CJI NV Ramana, Justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose observed.
15.It goes without saying that when the dying declaration has been recorded in accordance with law, and it gives a cogent and plausible explanation of the occurrence, the Court can rely upon it as the solitary piece of evidence to convict the accused. It is for this reason that Section 32 of the Evidence Act, 1872 is an exception to the general rule against the admissibility of hearsay evidence and its Clause (1)  makes the statement of the decease admissible. Such statement, classified as a "dying declaration" is made by a person as to the cause of his death or as to the injuries which culminated to his death or the circumstances under which injuries were inflicted. A dying declaration is thus admitted in evidence on the premise that the anticipation of brewing death breeds the same human feelings as that of a conscientious and guiltless person under oath. It is a statement comprising of last words of a person before his death which are presumed to be truthful, and not infected by any motive or malice. The dying declaration is therefore admissible in evidence on the principle of necessity as there is very little hope of survival of the maker, and if found reliable, it can certainly form the basis for conviction.
16.......Although there is neither a rule of law nor of prudence that the dying declaration cannot be acted upon without corroboration, the Court must nonetheless be satisfied that the dying declaration is true and voluntary, and only then could it be the sole basis for conviction without corroboration.
In Sampat Babso Kale and Another v. State of Maharashtra 2019 (4) SCC 739, the bench said, it was noted that "the endorsement made by the doctor that the victim was in a fit state of mind to make the statement has been made not before the statement but after the statement was recorded. Normally it should be the other way around."
The court also noted that, in this case, the prosecution had sufficient time to call a Judicial/Executive Magistrate to record the dying declaration. Further, the police officer admitted that he did not seek an endorsement from the doctor as to whether the injured was in a fit state of mind to make a statement, before he proceeded to record the statement.
"22.... It is common knowledge that such Officers are judicially trained to record dying declarations after complying with all the mandatory pre-requisites, including certification or endorsement from the Medical Officer that the victim was in a fit state of mind to make a statement. We hasten to add that the law does not compulsorily require the presence of a Judicial or Executive Magistrate to record a dying declaration or that a dying declaration cannot be relied upon as the solitary piece of evidence unless recorded by a Judicial or Executive Magistrate. It is only as a rule of prudence, and if so permitted by the facts and circumstances, the dying declaration may preferably be recorded by a Judicial or Executive Magistrate so as to muster additional strength to the prosecution case", the bench observed while setting aside the conviction of the accused.

The Karnataka High Court has said that contribution towards provident fund by an employee is a statutory deduction and non remittance of it by the employer in the employee’s account maintained with the Provident Fund Organisation, cannot attract the offence of cheating.
 A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna made this observation while allowing a petition filed by one CH K.S.Prasad and quashing the offences registered against him under sections 409 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code.
 The bench said,
“The case at hand is concerning contribution towards provident fund and its non-remittance to the Organization. It cannot be imagined as to how contribution of provident fund can be lured by the petitioner over the employees when it is a statutory deduction. Therefore, the cognizance for offence punishable under Section 420 of the IPC is recklessly taken, as none of the ingredients that are necessary to be proved for offence punishable under Section 420 as obtaining under Section 415 of the IPC are remotely present in the case at hand.” 
 The petitioner was an employee of M/s Vasan Healthcare Private Limited from 2012 up to 13-09-2017. During the said period, he further claims to have donned several roles in the Establishment and was for some time Senior Vice-President, Human Resources and was also authorised to sign certain forms in connection with the business of the Establishment including the forms of Employees Provident Fund.
 During the period from August 2014 to May 2015 the Establishment deducted provident fund from the wages of employees. The amount totaled to 95,58,104, based upon this, a complaint came to be registered on 06-08-2015 before the 1st respondent alleging offences punishable under Sections 406 and 409 of the IPC.
 The Police after investigation filed a charge sheet; the petitioner approached the court calling in question the proceedings.
 The petitioner contended that he was discharged of liability by the Special Court for Economic Offences. However, on the same set of facts, the present criminal case was being continued, without making the Establishment as an accused in the proceedings.
 Findings:
 The bench noted that the Establishment (company) between August 2014 and May 2015 did not remit contributions that were deducted from the salaries of employees of the Establishment to the Organization. The reason behind non-remittance is that the Bank accounts of the Establishment were attached by the Income-Tax Department in several cases. Following which a criminal case before the Special Court for Economic Offences under Paragraph 76(d) of the Employees’ provident Fund Scheme, 1952 read with Sections 14(1A) and 14A of the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 for contravention of Section 6 of the Act r/w Para 30 and 38 of the Employees’ Provident Fund Scheme, 1952 was instituted. The proceedings before the Special Court were against the Establishment and one Mr. A.M.Arun, the Chairman.
 The High Court vide its order dated 18-02-2019 observed that it was the petitioner who was at the helm of affairs and not the Chairman Mr.A.M.Arun and accordingly the proceedings against the Chairman were quashed.
 Further, the concerned court had considered the application of the present petitioner for discharge and in terms of its order dated 31-08-2019 it accordingly discharged him. Even the Establishment was absolved on the ground that it could not remit the amount on account of its bank accounts being frozen by the Income Tax.
 Following which the bench observed “Section 420 of the IPC has its ingredients in Section 415 of the IPC. The ingredients are that an accused should lure the complainant/firm to part with certain property with dishonest intention.”
 It then held “It cannot be imagined as to how contribution of provident fund can be lured by the petitioner over the employees when it is a statutory deduction. Therefore, the cognizance for offence punishable under Section 420 of the IPC is recklessly taken, as none of the ingredients that are necessary to be proved for offence punishable under Section 420 as obtaining under Section 415 of the IPC are remotely present in the case at hand.”
 As regarding the cognizance taken by the court of section 409 of IPC which pertains to breach of trust by a servant or a banker or whoever being entrusted with some property, the bench said “If ingredients of Section 409 of the IPC are alleged element of mens rea would become mandatory.”
 Then it held “The finding of the Special Court in favour of the Establishment was that there was no willful default on the part of the Establishment and it was a circumstance which was beyond the control of the Establishment, as the Income Tax Department authorities had attached the properties of the Establishment. If that be the finding and the said finding having become final, the petitioner cannot be hauled into the web of crime for an offence under Section 409 of the IPC, as if there is willful default against the Establishment. There cannot be anything willful laid against the petitioner. There is no iota of element of mens rea that is alleged against the petitioner.”
 Finally it held “The proceedings are instituted only against the petitioner. The petitioner was an employee of the Establishment. For proceedings to be instituted for offences under Sections 406 or 420 of the IPC, the Establishment ought to have been made a party. Without the Establishment being an accused, the proceedings against the petitioner cannot be permitted to be continued.”
 Accordingly it allowed the petition saying “Permitting further proceedings to be continued against the petitioner would 19 degenerate into harassment, becomes an abuse of the process of law and ultimately result in miscarriage of justice.”

"It is only in the Supreme Court of India that one can come against a procedural direction passed by a Single Judge at an interim stage. Such a thing would not happen in the US Supreme Court", remarked Justice D. Y. Chandrachud on Tuesday.
This was in connection with the challenge to the view taken by a Delhi High Court Single Judge that a suit for trademark infringement between different wings of science and technology giant Merck may proceed to be decided based on the material on record, without immediately recording any further evidence, and that the question whether any evidence is to be recorded would be determined after hearing the advocates finally. In the impugned order, Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw had taken a view that final hearing in the matter will take place based on the admitted documents already placed on record and if and when evidence is required to be taken, a call in that behalf will be taken at the appropriate stage.
The bench of Justices Chandrachud, R. Subhash Reddy and Ravindra Bhat was considering an SLP by Merck Sharp & Dohme and others (defendants before the High Court) arising out of a November 12, 2020 order of the Delhi High Court on its Interlocutory Application for cross-examination of the technical expert of the plaintiff (Merck KGAA; respondent no. 1 in the SLP) and for tendering into evidence affidavit by way of examination-in-chief of the witnesses of the defendants and for hot tubbing.
"I clarify, that on hearing the counsels at length qua Case Management including on framing of issues, on 1st April, 2019 and further on 12th April, 2019, I had formed an opinion that considering the nature of controversy, no evidence was required to be recorded in the suit and the suit could be decided on the basis of material on record. It was however observed that if on hearing, it appeared that any particular aspect required recording of evidence, recording of evidence thereon shall be permitted at that stage. I further clarify that even thereafter when (the said IA) came up, the opinion earlier formed remained unchanged and it was intended that the arguments on (the IA) be also heard along with the final arguments of the senior counsel for the defendants in the suit and if during the said arguments, the senior counsel for the defendants satisfies that there is a need for recording evidence, evidence shall be taken at that time", Justice Endlaw had said in the impugned order.
On Tuesday, Senior Advocate K. V. Vishwanathan, for the SLP petitioners, urged, "Once the affidavit has been taken by the Court, how can cross-examination be denied?".
"It is only in the Supreme Court of India where one can come against a procedural direction passed by a Single Judge at an interim stage. Such a thing would not happen in the US Supreme Court", remarked Justice Chandrachud.
"This is a classic case of Indians complicating matters! I assume you are for the Indian wing of the licensee?", said Justice Bhat to Mr. Vishwanathan.
"You have argued in the High Court for 4 hours, you have made submissions, and now you want us to interfere? Not at this stage, Mr. Vishwanathan. 
This is just defeating the purpose of the Commercial Courts Act and the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules of 2018! 
These are High Court judges we are talking about!", continued Justice Chandrachud.
"With all our forensic expertise, we are defeating the Parliamentary intent in a commercial suit! This is why we need to reform ourselves!...I have been to the Japanese IP courts and they don't hear counsel. It is only when there is a complex patent dispute that the counsel are called for clarification. That is also by way of a conference, there are no courtrooms...", observed Justice Bhat.
The bench then proceeded to dismiss the SLP.
It may be noted that the Commercial Courts Act was introduced with the primary objective of adjudication of disputes falling under this Act in a swift time bound manner and lesser hassles to the litigating parties and by introducing minimal interference by the higher courts, when the dispute is pending before the Commercial Court constituted under this Act.
The controversy subject matter of the suit before the Delhi High Court is, (i) the plaintiff (Merck KGAA) is a German Company and the defendants (Merck Sharp & Dohme and others) are American Companies; (ii) the promoters of the said Companies were members of the same family and belonged to Germany; after some of the family members moved to the USA, the American Companies were incorporated; (iii) there have been several agreements between the two sets of companies, of the years 1932, 1945, 1955, 1970 and 1975, relating inter alia to division of territories in which the two will carry on business and use the mark "MERCK" ; (iv) under the said agreements, the defendants‟ business and use of the mark is limited to USA, Canada, Cuba and Philippines, the plaintiff is entitled to carry on business and use the mark in rest of the world; and, (v) the advent of internet has led to the present disputes, with the plaintiff alleging breach of contract, infringement and passing off by the defendants in India by use of the mark on the internet including on various other social media platforms.

The Tripura High Court on Monday issued notice in a PIL seeking criminal action against the District Magistrate for misusing and abusing his official authority in relation to a viral video of an incident that took place on 26th April 2021 in Agartala wherein a marriage function was stopped midway by the DM and his team which had allegedly run past the covid curfew hours in the city.

The Tripura High Court on Monday issued notice in a PIL seeking criminal action against the District Magistrate for misusing and abusing his official authority in relation to a viral video of an incident that took place on 26th April 2021 in Agartala wherein a marriage function was stopped midway by the DM and his team which had allegedly run past the covid curfew hours in the city. 
A division bench comprising of Chief Justice Akil Kureshi and Justice SG Chattopadhyay issued a bunch of interim directions while issuing notice including shifting of the DM out of Agartala after having a prima facie view that it would be necessary to do so "in order to conduct an impartial fact finding inquiry regarding the incident and the role played by the D.M." 
The petition, filed by the priest who had performed the marriage ceremony, claims that the DM had "behaved improperly with the people present and had exceeded his powers." Stating thus, the plea sought several prayers including individual criminal action against the DM and also against the members of his team who had accompanied him to the marriage hall by conducting a departmental inquiry against them. 
After the video of the incident went viral on social media, the State Government had instituted a two member Committee to inquire into the incident and for submitting a report in the incident. In another development in the case, the DM concerned was suspended by the Government vide order dated 2nd May 2021 till further orders. 
While hearing the parties in camera, the Court, after opining that the issue needs consideration, went ahead to observe that some prayers in the PIL cannot be entertained. 
The Court observed that the prayer seeking action against the members of the team led by the DM cannot be entertained as they were "merely carrying out the orders issued to them by their superior." 
"Even if there is any lacuna in issuing such orders or exceeding of the jurisdiction by the authority, this support staff cannot be made answerable for their actions. At the time when the entire country is facing an extremely difficult situation of managing corona virus spread, we would certainly not send signals to the foot soldiers that carrying out the orders of their superiors can expose them to inquiries." The Court observed. 
The Court further requested the DM concerned to not make any public statements in relation to the incident till further orders. 
On the request of the Advocate General appearing for the State to prevent the media to publish news in relation to the court proceedings, the Court observed thus: 
"We are not inclined to issue any such general gag order. Freedom of press is a valuable fundamental right and relates to the right of the people of excess to information. Such right cannot be lightly curtailed. We, however, assure learned Advocate General of two things. One, no amount of sensationalization of the issue from any quarter would hamper our judgment and secondly, if any instance of any publication which is either contemptuous or is defamatory is brought to our notice, the same can always be dealt with on case to case basis. In any case, we expect the media to be responsible and publish the news as truthfully as the events have taken place." 
Issuing notice to the respondents in the plea, the Court issued the following interim measures: 
-	We are of the strong prima facie view that in order to conduct an impartial fact finding inquiry regarding the incident and the role played by the D.M.; which is absolutely imperative; it would be essential that he is shifted out of Agartala. Any such inquiry would necessarily require recording of statements of witnesses. It would be difficult for many witnesses to come forward and to give truthful account of the incident if the D.M. is retained at Agartala. We would strongly request the learned Advocate General to take instructions from the Government on this aspect of the matter and revert back to the Court on the next date of hearing with necessary instructions. 
-	The District Magistrate shall not make any public statements in any form including to media be it electronic, print or social media in relation to the incident of the night of 26th April, 2021 and the subsequent inquiry which is pending against him. 
- Until further orders, the inquiry instituted against the District Magistrate shall not proceed further. 
-	The District Magistrate shall also place on record any order of suspending the license of the marriage halls if he has passed after 26th of April, 2021 incident. 
-	The petitioners as well as the learned Advocate General shall supply the information and documents as provided in the earlier part of this order 
The matter will now be next heard on 5th May 2021.

The Supreme Court observed that the wilful breach of the undertaking given to the Court can amount to Contempt under Section 2(b) of the Contempt of Courts Act.

The Supreme Court observed that the wilful breach of the undertaking given to the Court can amount to Contempt under Section 2(b) of the Contempt of Courts Act. 
An undertaking given by a party should be seen in the context in which it was made and (i) the benefits that accrued to the undertaking party; and (ii) the detriment/injury suffered by the counter party, the bench comprising Justices Indira Banerjee and V. Ramasubramanian observed.
The bench, however, expressed its doubt about the observation made in an earlier judgment that there is no distinction between wilful violation of the terms of a consent decree and wilful violation of a decree passed on adjudication. 
In this case, the Delhi High Court had held a husband and wife guilty of committing contempt of Court and sentenced them to simple imprisonment for three months along with a fine of Rs.2000. The proceedings were initiated by the Court in view of breach of an undertaking given by them to Court,while obtaining conditional order of stay.
Their contentions before the Apex Court in appeal were: (i) that the failure of a party to comply with an undertaking, on the basis of which a conditional order of stay was granted, cannot be treated as a wilful disobedience warranting the invocation of the contempt jurisdiction; (ii) that the failure of the petitioners to honour the undertaking cannot be taken to substantially interfere with the due course of justice and, hence, the case would fall under Section 13(a) of the Act; (iii) that when an order indicates the consequences of the failure of a party to comply with a condition or honour the undertaking, the invocation of the contempt jurisdiction may not be appropriate; and (iv) that in any case if the defaulting party has relied upon an interpretation of the order that the consequences of failure are already inbuilt in the order, such an understanding of the order is to be treated as reasonable and rational and he cannot be held guilty of contempt
"16. It is true that this Court has held in a series of decisions that the wilful breach of the undertaking given to the Court amounts to contempt of Court under Section 2(b) of the Act. But the Court has always seen (i) the nature of the undertaking made; (ii) the benefit if any, reaped by the party giving the undertaking; and (iii) whether the filing of the undertaking was with a view to play fraud upon the court or to hoodwink the opposite party."
Doubts Rama Narang Judgment
The court noted that in Babu Ram Gupta vs. Sudhir Bhasin, the court had noted the distinction between an order passed on consent terms and an order passed solely on the basis of an undertaking given to court and the distinction between a person playing fraud on the court thereby obstructing the course of justice and a person playing fraud on one of the parties. Referring to another judgment in Rama Narang vs. Ramesh Narang  the court observed:
"In Rama Narang (supra), this Court pointed out the distinction between two categories of cases covered by Section 2(b) of the Act namely (i) wilful disobedience to a process of court; and (ii) wilful breach of an undertaking given to a court...This Court went to the extent of holding that it would neither be in consonance with the statute, judicial authority, principle or logic to draw any distinction between the wilful violation of the terms of a consent decree and wilful violation of a decree passed on adjudication. We have our own doubts whether the first category of cases covered by Section 2(b) can be stretched so far. Anyway, that question does not arise in this case and hence we leave it at that.", the bench said.
An act of contempt cannot simply be based upon the subsequent conduct
The bench further observed that an undertaking given by a party should be seen in the context in which it was made and (i) the benefits that accrued to the undertaking party; and (ii) the detriment/injury suffered by the counter party. 
"It is also true that normally the question whether a party is guilty of contempt is to be seen in the specific context of the disobedience and the wilful nature of the same and not on the basis of the conduct subsequent thereto. While it is open to the court to see whether the subsequent conduct of the alleged contemnor would tantamount to an aggravation of the contempt already committed, the very determination of an act of contempt cannot simply be based upon the subsequent conduct.. But the subsequent conduct of the party may throw light upon one important aspect namely whether it was just the inability of the party to honour the commitment or it was part of a larger design to hoodwink the court.", it added.
Taking note of the facts of the case, the bench observed that it is unable to find fault with the High Court holding the petitioners guilty of contempt. The court therefore upheld the finding of guilt, but ordered reduction of the period of sentence from three months to the period of imprisonment already suffered/undergone.

After ordering Amazon to remove the listings of Pakistan-manufactured Rooh Afza from its platform in India, the Delhi High Court has passed a permanent injunction in favour of Hamdard National Foundation (India) restraining various sellers from offering the infringing products.
Hamdard National Foundation and Hamdard Laboratories India (Hamdard Dawakhana) had earlier filed a suit against Amazon and some sellers which were offering the products of its Pakistani counterpart on the e-commerce site in India. Justice Prathiba M. Singh on September 5 had directed Amazon to remove the listings of infringing products from its Indian website within 48 hours and provide details of the sellers to Hamdard. 
On November 11, the counsel representing the Plaintiffs submitted that since all the details of the sellers have been received and all the infringing listings have been taken down, the reliefs sought in the plaint stand satisfied. 
"Considering the submissions made and the facts recorded above, the suit shall stand decreed in terms of paragraph 38(a) of the Plaint against Defendant No.2 as also the sellers mentioned above," said the court while ordering a permanent injunction against six sellers.
The court further directed Amazon that in case any other listings infringing Hamdard's mark 'Rooh Afza' are found, the same be taken down in accordance with the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, which were amended this year.
Introduced by well-known Unani practitioner Hakim Hafiz Abdul Majeed in Delhi more than a century back, Rooh Afza also became a victim of the India-Pakistan partition when his younger son decided to migrate to Pakistan and his elder son stayed in India. They started separate Hamdard companies - Hamdard National Foundation owns rights over the drink in India, Hamdard Laboratories (Waqf) manufactures it in Pakistan.
In September, the plaintiffs had told the court that three purchases made by through Amazon revealed that the products being sold under the 'Roof Afza' mark originated from Karachi, Pakistan. Justice Singh in the interim order on September 5 observed that Rooh Afza is a product which has been consumed by the Indian public for over a century now.
"The same being a drink for human consumption, the quality standards have to comply with the applicable regulations prescribed by the FSSAI and LMA. It is surprising that an imported product is being sold on www.amazon.in platform without the complete details of the manufacturer being disclosed," the court had observed, adding that any consumer would confuse the Pakistani product as being connected or originating from the plaintiffs.

The Himachal Pradesh High Court on Thursday observed that a surrogate woman, getting child through arrangement by surrogate parents, is entitled to avail maternity leave benefits under Rule 43(1) of CCS (Leave) Rules, 1972.

The Himachal Pradesh High Court on Thursday observed that a surrogate woman, getting child through arrangement by surrogate parents, is entitled to avail maternity leave benefits under Rule 43(1) of CCS (Leave) Rules, 1972. 
Observing thus, the Court also opined that it would be "an insult to womanhood" to distinguish between a mother who begets a child through surrogacy and a natural mother who gives birth to a child. 
The observation came from a division bench comprising of Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Justice Sandeep Sharma while considering a petition filed by a surrogate mother seeking maternity leave benefits. 
The bench observed thus: 
"Motherhood never ends on the birth of the child and a commissioning mother cannot be refused paid maternity leave. A woman cannot be discriminated, as far as maternity benefits are concerned, only on the ground that she has obtained the baby through surrogacy. A newly born child cannot be left at the mercy of others as it needs rearing and that is the most crucial period during which the child requires care and attention of his mother. The tremendous amount of learning that takes place in the first year of the baby's life, the baby learns a lot too. A bond of affection has also to be developed." 
The petitioner was working as a language teacher on a contractual basis posted at a Government school in Kullu district. She was blessed with a baby on 10th September 2020 through a surrogacy treatment. 
In view of the same, she had applied for maternity leave to the Principal of the Government School who in turn forwarded her application to Deputy Director of Higher Education, Kullu seeking a clarification as to whether the petitioner being a surrogate mother, is entitled for maternity leave on surrogacy. 
The High Court while analyzing the judgments on the subject of surrogacy at length, relied on the case of Baby Manju Yamada v. Union of India & Anr. (2008) 13 SCC 518 wherein the Apex Court observed various forms of surrogacy including traditional, gestational, altruistic and commercial surrogacy. 
While referring to the Rule 43 of CCS (Leave) Rules providing for Maternity Leave, the Court observed thus: 
"Once, the respondents admit that the minor child is that of the petitioner, then she is entitled to the leave akin to the persons, who are granted leave in terms of the rules (ibid). The purpose of the said rules is for proper bonding between the child and parents." 
Reliance was also made to a Bombay High Court judgment in Dr. Hema Vijay Menon v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. AIR 2005 Bom 231 wherein the Court observed that "If Maternity means motherhood, it would not be proper to distinguish between a natural and biological mother and a mother who has begotten a child through surrogacy or has adopted a child from the date of his/ her birth. The object of maternity leave is to protect the dignity of motherhood by providing for full and healthy maintenance of the woman and her child. Maternity leave is intended to achieve the object of ensuring social justice to women." 
Observing the constitutional mandate under Art. 42 which provides that the State shall make provision for securing just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief, the High Court went ahead to observe: 
"It was long felt that the working women were unable to depute their time towards their children due to exigencies of service. Hence, the concept of grant of child care leave was introduced to ensure the welfare of the child so as to enable the mother to avail child care leave whenever she feels that the child needs the care. This is in tune with the international covenants and treaties to which India is a signatory." 
Therefore, the High Court allowed the petition and directed the respondent authorities to sanction/grant maternity leave to the petitioner under the CCS (Leave) Rules, 1972.

The Allahabad High Court today granted bail to Senior Samajwadi Party leader and a Member Of Parliament, Mohammad Azam Khan in a case registered against him in connection with the 2016 Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam recruitment scam.
The Bench of Justice Ramesh Sinha noted that the State had failed to point out any clinching evidence from the charge sheet against Khan, which could show that he actively participated in the recruitment process in the U.P. Jal Nigam.
It may be noted that Khan is presently facing 87 criminal cases and he has been released on bail in all cases, except two cases including the instant case. He would be able to get out of jail if he is granted bail in one more case against him. He is presently lodged in the Sitapur Jail.
In the UP Assembly Election results declared yesterday, Khan was declared as the winning candidate from the Rampur Assembly seat in Uttar Pradesh's Rampur district.
The case in brief
As per the case of the prosecution, the investigation in the alleged Recruitment scam was handed over to the Special Investigation Team on a complaint filed regarding alleged irregularities in the appointments to 1,300 vacant posts in the Jal Nigam in the year 2016.
Allegedly, the Chairman of the Jal Nigam (Khan) had unauthorizedly approved the proposal of the Managing Director and the Officer-on-Special Duty for conducting the examination of Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer and for conducting the examination of Clerks and Stenographers through M/s Aptech Ltd, Mumbai without the recommendation of Jal Nigam Board.
When the BJP government came to power in Uttar Pradesh in March 2017, an inquiry was ordered in the matter and 122 recruited engineers were also dismissed from service.  A First Information Report [FIR] was registered in the case in the year 2018 under Sections 409, 420, 120-B, 201 I.P.C. and Section 13 (1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act against Khan and co-accused persons on the allegations of irregular recruitment/appointment.
After due investigation, the Investigating Officer submitted a charge sheet in May 2021 against Khan and co-accused person Girish Chandra Srivastava under Sections 201, 204, 420, 467, 468, 471 read with Section 120B I.P. and Section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. 
The trial court took cognizance on the aforesaid charge sheet. After that, the applicant approached the Special Judge (Anti-Corruption) (C.B.I.) (Central), Lucknow by filing a bail application, which was rejected, and thereafter, khan filed the instant first application for bail before this Court
Court's observations
In its order, the court noted that the Additional Advocate General conceded before the Court that there was no direct evidence against Khan in the charge sheet and he only stated that the applicant being a powerful and influential person, no direct evidence could be collected against him.
Significantly, the Court noted that on the recommendation of the Managing Director and officials of the U.P. Jal Nigam, Khan, being the Chairman of the U.P. Jal Nigam had only consented that the recruitment be done by M/s Aptech Ltd. when TCS showed its inability to conduct the said on-line examination.
Further, the Court noted that he is no longer holding any post in the affairs of the State and that there is no further chance of tampering with the evidence. The Court also took into account the fact that the charge-sheet has been filed in May 2021 and the trial Court has taken cognizance of it. 
In view of this, finding that the continued custody of the applicant, prima facie, may not be necessary for the purpose of further investigation and trial in the instant case, the Cour granted him bail.

The Kerala High Court recently held that where a civil dispute is pending before the Civil Court, the Electricity Department ought to be circumspect in entertaining a complaint, unless there is gross violation of provisions of the Act.
Justice Amit Rawal passed the above order in a petition that was filed challenging the communication issued by the Electricity Board to the petitioner, asking her to show ownership of the property in question. 
"Electricity department has no business to check the veracity of the ownership. Once the matter is pending before the civil court, Electricity Department should be circumspect in entertaining the complaint until and unless there is gross violation of provisions of the Act", the Court observed.
The petitioner, Rasheeda, was asked by the Kerala State Electricity Board Ltd. (KSEB) to provide an explanation to show the ownership of the property. The notice was issued by the KSEB pursuant to a complaint by by one Pookilath Abdul Shukur (4th respondent). 
It is the petitioner's averment that the alleged complainant had already filed a civil suit before the Munsiff Court at Chavakkad, which had granted an injunction with respect to a motorable way until the disposal of the suit. It was submitted by Advocate M.G. Sreejith on behalf of the petitioner that the complainant harboured animosity against the petitioner's husband, who is also the former's brother, and had thus, maliciously filed the complaint before the Electricity Department in respect of drawing a 500 meter wire to the borewell alleged to be used illegally. The Electricity Department had thus called on the petitioner to furnish the details of ownership without verifying the veracity of the complaint or the file of the electric connection allotted to the petitioner. It was contended by the counsel that since a civil dispute regarding the property was pending before the civil court, the Electricity Department could not have sent the impugned communication. 
It is in this context that the Court discerned that, 
"Once the civil suit is pending there was no occasion for the respondents to lodge a complaint as an act of disgruntlement". 
It went on to state that the notice issued by the Electricity Department was "wholly uncalled for and arbitrary much less illegal and without jurisdiction". 
The Court thus allowed the writ petition, and quashed the impugned notice. 
Standing Counsel for KSEB, Advocate B. Premod appeared on behalf of the respondents. 
Case Title: Rasheeda v. Kerala State Electricity Board Ltd. & Ors. 

The Madras High Court recently observed that trial courts should refrain from acting solely on memo filed by the counsel of the party conceding the substantive right of the party viz-a-viz the subject matter of the suit, or right of defence, for passing any non-adjudicatory decree or appealable orders.
Justice N Seshasayee observed that though there is not a complete ban on considering the memo filed by the counsel of the parties, what must be looked into is the effect that the memo and the consequential order will have on the rights of the parties. 
The court also held that though a lawyer is authorized to act on behalf of his client through the Vakalatnama, there should be an express authority granted to him to enter into compromise and the same could not be implied. 
The court further observed that the law in this regard was already settled through the decision of the Supreme court in Himalayan Coop. Group Housing Society v. Balwan Singh, [(2015) 7 SCC 373] where a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court held that An Advocate has no implied authority to concede the substantive rights of his client in a litigation.
The court highlighted that even where the court chooses to act on a memo, it is required to evaluate the consequences of acting on such Memo. No Court, under any circumstances, should pass a decree or an order which it is not competent to pass, or which violates any of the mandatory provisions of law. 
In the present case, a challenge was made against a decree passed by the Subordinate Court, Gudiyatham wherein the court acting upon an alleged memo filed by the counsel for the revision petitioner had decreed a suit. The revision petitioner contended that no such memo was filed on his behalf by the counsel and that the Court was tricked by Plaintiff in the suit (first respondent herein) to pass such order.
The court held that even if it is assumed that the counsel for the revision petitioner (second defendant in the suit) had filed a memo, the subordinate court ought to have looked into the facts of the case and the previous proceeding. The court failed to consider the fact that the revision petitioner had impleaded himself into the suit stating that he was one of the absolute owners of the suit property. The court also should have considered the fact that in previous postings, the very same court was not inclined to allow the suit merely on an unregistered sale deed indicating its doubt over the right of the plaintiff to sustain his claim of declaration of title over the suit property.
The court was, therefore, inclined to allow the revision petition and directed resumption of the suit from the date of carrying out the amendment in the plaint after the restoration of suit in 2015.
Supervisory Power Under Article 227
One of the main challenges that was raised by the respondents was that the High Court did not have any power under Article 227 of the Constitution to travel into the domain of disputed facts.
To this, the court discussed in detail the supervisory power under Article 227 of the Constitution. The court observed that the power of supervision under Article 227 is intended to secure and sustain the public faith in the judicial system. It may be understood as a duty to drone-cam the functioning of the courts subordinate to it to ensure that the quality of its functioning is effective and is worthy of sustaining the trust of the litigant public. 
In the present case, the question was not whether the counsel had filed a memo before the trial court but how the trial court had approached the case. The court ought to have ensured the presence of the revision petitioner (second defendant) and should not have acted merely on a memo.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that if the place of hiding the weapon is exclusively within the knowledge of the accused and that place cannot be or is not in the knowledge of any other person and the weapon is recovered from the same place, such type of recovery is absolutely reliable.The bench of Justice Dr. Kaushal Jayendra Thaker and Justice Ajai Tyagi observed this while upholding...
The Allahabad High Court has observed that if the place of hiding the weapon is exclusively within the knowledge of the accused and that place cannot be or is not in the knowledge of any other person and the weapon is recovered from the same place, such type of recovery is absolutely reliable.
The bench of Justice Dr. Kaushal Jayendra Thaker and Justice Ajai Tyagi observed this while upholding the conviction of a murder accused (Anurag Sharma) who killed his own father and was sentenced to life imprisonment by Additional Sessions Judge, Meerut in 2018.
In this case, the accused was convicted for murdering his own father, and later on, the murder weapon (hammer) was recovered at his instance. In view of this, the Court reasoned that the place of hiding of the weapon was in the exclusive knowledge of the accused and when the weapon was indeed recovered from that place, therefore, the Court held that such recovery was absolutely reliable.
The case in brief 
The complainant Shail Kumari Sharma filed an FIR alleging that she had left her husband Prem Kishan Sharma (deceased) aged about 70 years and her son Anurag Sharma (accused) at home.
When she returned to her house, she saw there that her husband was lying in the dead condition in the corridor of the first floor of the house, and her son Anurag (accused), who was drug addict and used to demand money for it from his father, was absent from the house. 
The accused appellant was arrested on the same day of the occurrence and I.O. Recovered the hammer on the pointing out of the accused from inside the box, which was in the room, adjacent to the kitchen of the house. The hammer was having blood on it, which was used for the commission of the crime.
After completion of the investigation, a charge sheet was submitted against accused-appellant Anurag Sharma. He was examined under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. by putting evidence against him wherein he denied the evidence against him and stated that his father was murdered in order to rob his house or commit dacoity.
He further submitted that the police had falsely implicated him to suppress the said heinous offence. It was also stated by the accused that he was handicapped to the tune of 60%, but he was never a drug addict. He was under depression due to disability, hence the doctors used to administer him sleeping medicine.
Court's observations
The Court took into account the fact that even though the complainant (PW1/mother of the accused) turned hostile, but in her examination-in-chief, she had corroborated the version of FIR. The Court also noted that she had admitted in her cross-examination that when she returned home, the accused was not at home and he came later on. 
In view of this, the Court noted that after committing the offence, the accused had fled away, and therefore, the Court concluded that the version of FIR cannot be doubted even though the author has turned hostile.
Now, taking into account her testimony, the Court noted that the mother of the deceased/complainant had confirmed the version of the FIR that she had left the deceased and accused at home and no one else was present there. 
"It means that when the deceased was murdered, it was accused only, who was in the house with the deceased. Hence, Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act comes into application," the Court said as it noted that the accused had not been able to discharge his burden under Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act. 
The Court observed that the accused had stated in his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C., wherein he had taken a stand that his father was murdered during the robbery or dacoity in his house, however, the Court noted that no iota of evidence was placed on record by him to prove that on the day of the incident any robbery and dacoity had taken place in the house.
Hence, the Court concluded that the appellant had failed to discharge his burden.
Now, regarding the recovery of the hammer used for the commission of the crime, the Court noted that the same was made on the pointing out of the accused-appellant from a very specific and such place which was only in his knowledge.
Stressing that the place of hiding the hammer was only, only, and only within the knowledge of the accused and that it was not known to any other person, the Court observed thus:
"If the place of hiding the weapon is exclusively within the knowledge of accused and that place cannot be or is not in the knowledge of any other person and the weapon is recovered from the same place, such type of recovery is absolutely reliable and it cannot be doubted or it cannot be presumed that weapon is planted. In this case at hand, the hammer was recovered by IO after getting the knowledge from the appellant and at the time of the recovery IO took the appellant with him and the appellant entrusted the hammer to the IO after taking out it from the box himself. The Investigating Officer (PW6) has also proved the factum of recovery in his testimony before the learned trial court."
Further, the Court also noted that the hammer was blood-stained and when the same was sent to FSL for chemical examination, the report of the laboratory came against the appellant because as per the aforesaid report, the blood was found on the hammer.
Now, regarding the stand taken by the accused-appellant that he was disabled to the tune of 60% and His disability is in one hand and one leg, the Court referred to the finding of the trial court, wherein it was concluded that the accused was in a position to use the hammer so forcibly that the antemortem injuries mentioned in postmortem report could be inflicted.
Consequently, keeping in view the fact that the appellant had motive to commit the crime. PW1 and PW3 even after turning hostile has supported the prosecution version. Accused-appellant has failed to discharge his burden of proof under Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, the Court upheld his conviction and dismissed the appeal.

Observing that a family court can dissolve the marriage of a Muslim couple by mutual consent under the Muslim Personal Law, the Bombay High Court quashed criminal proceeding against the husband based on the couple's amicable settlement in the Family Court petition.
 The court noted that under Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Act 1937 all property, marriage, dissolution of marriage including mubaraat, maintenance, dower, guardianship gifts, trusts and trust properties concerning Muslims is governed by the Act. 
 Moreover, the Family Court was empowered to adjudicate a suit regarding validity of a marriage or a person's matrimonial status under section 7 (1)(b) of the Family Courts Act, the bench said. 
 "….the Family Court has rightly applied the provisions of Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 to the parties before us and accordingly declared the status of marriage as no more in existence by mutual consent," the court said in its order. 
 Thereafter based, on the Supreme court Judgement in Kulwinder Singh's which states that cases arising from matrimonial discord can be quashed in case of settlement, quashed the present proceedings. 
 Facts of the Case
 The husband sought quashing of an FIR registered with the Parbhani police for the offences punishable under sections 498(A), 323, 504, 506 of the Indian Penal Code and also the consequential charge-sheet on the ground that the parties have arrived at amicable settlement.
 The husband's counsel Shaikh Wajeed Ahmed submitted that the couple got separated by mutual consent and accordingly approached the Family Court, Parbhani for declaration of their matrimonial status in terms of provisions of section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 read with section 7(1)(b) Explanation (b) of the Family Courts Act, 1984. 
 On March 9, 2022 the Family court judge allowed the petition and declared their status as they are no more husband and wife in terms of the mutual agreement between them. The wife gave her consent for quashing the criminal proceedings after she received Rs. 5 lakhs as full and final settlement. 
 Prosecutor SS Dande relied on the Supreme Court judgement in the case of Zohara Khatoon Vs. Mohd. Ibrahim, (1981) 2 SCC 509, to say that mubarat (divorce initiated by the woman) is a form of extrajudicial divorce based on mutual consent under Islamic Law and same is valid, as it remains untouched by the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act. 
 According to the judgement, there are three distinct modes in which a Muslim marriage can be dissolved and the relationship of the husband and the wife terminated so as to result in an irrevocable divorce.
 (1)Where the husband gives divorce according to any of the forms approved by the Mahomedan law, viz, Talaq ahsan which is a single pronouncement of divorce during tuhar (Period between menstruations) followed by abstinence from sexual intercourse for the period of iddat. Others are Talak hasan and Talak-ul-bidaat or talalk-i-badai which consists of three pronouncements made during a single tuhr either in one sentence or in three sentences signifying a clear intention to divorce the wife.
 (2) By an agreement between the husband and the wife whereby a wife obtains divorce by relinquishing either her entire or part of the dower. This mode of divorce is called 'khula' or Mubarat. Where, however, both parties agree and desire a separation resulting in a divorce, it is called mubarat. 
 (3) By obtaining a decree from a civil court for dissolution of marriage under s. 2 of the Act of 1939 which also amounts to a divorce (under the law) obtained by the wife. For the purpose of maintenance, this mode is governed not by clause (b) but by clause (c) of sub-section (3) of s. 127 of the 1973 Code; whereas the divorce given under modes (1) and (2) would be covered by clause (b) of sub-section (3) of s. 127."
 The court said "It appears that the parties have arrived at amicable settlement voluntarily," and therefore quashed the criminal cases against the husband.
 Case Title: SHAIKH TASLIM SHAIKH HAKIM VERSUS THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA AND ANOTHER

Granting bail to a man in a case registered under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, the Delhi High Court has said that the rigours of Section 37 of the enactment will not be applicable in cases where collection of contraband sample itself was faulty. 
Section 37 states that bail should not be granted to an accused unless the accused is able to satisfy twin conditions i.e. reasonable ground for believing that the accused is not guilty of such an offence and that the accused would not commit an offence or is not likely to commit an offence, if granted bail.
Justice Jasmeet Singh granted bail to one Laxman Thakur accused in an FIR registered under sections 20 and 29 of NDPS Act. He alleged that the procedure adopted for collection of samples in the case was faulty and in violation of the guidelines issued by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). 
As per the seizure memo, 12 Kgs of Ganja recovered from 6 packets which was in possession of one Ajit Kumar as well as 5 packets of 2 Kgs each of Ganja found from Thakur were mixed at the time of recovery.
Justice Singh observed that as mandated by the Supreme Court in the case titled Union of India v. Bal Mukund & Ors., the standing order 1/88 has been "opined to be a 'requirement of law'."
Noting that the standing order mandates that the transferring of content of all packets into one and then drawing a sample from the mixture is not permitted, the court said:
"I am of the view that in the present case, the instructions in 1/88 has not been followed and the sample has been drawn after mixing the contents of various packets into one container. The same has caused serious prejudice to the case of the applicant. Since the collection of sample itself is faulty, the rigours of Section 37 of the NDPS Act will not be applicable."
The court noted that Thakur has been in custody since February 26, 2022 and has no criminal antecedents. He has no criminal cases of any nature pending against him, Justice Singh said. 
Title: LAXMAN THAKUR v. STATE (GOVT. OF NCT OF DELHI)

The Supreme Court, in a judgment delivered on Wednesday (9 Nov 2022), explained the method to determine the compensation for use and occupation of the tenancy premises by a tenant who suffered an eviction decree.
From the date of the decree of eviction, the tenant is liable to pay mesne profits or compensation for use and occupation of the premises at the same rate at which the landlord would have been able to let out the premises and earn rent if the tenant would have vacated the premises, the bench of Justices MR Shah and MM Sundresh observed.
In this case, while admitting the revision application preferred by the tenant, who is aggrieved of the eviction decree , the High Cour directed the Tenant to deposit Rs. 2,50,000/- per month towards compensation as a condition of stay. To arrive at this figure, the High Court considered the amount paid by the purchaser of the property in question (Sumer Corporation). Thus the Corporation challenged this order before the Apex Court.
Disagreeing with this method adopted by the High Court, the Apex Court bench, by referring to the decision in Atma Ram Properties (P) Ltd. Vs. Federal Motors (P) Ltd., (2005) 1 SCC 705 and State of Maharashtra and Anr. Vs. SuperMax International Private Limited and Ors., (2009) 9 SCC 772., observed: 
"If the approach adopted by the High Court is accepted and/or approved, in a given case, it may happen that the lessor might have purchased the property forty years back and/or long back and if the said approach is considered and thereafter the monthly compensation is determined, the same cannot be said to be a reasonable compensation...As observed and held by this Court in the case of Atma Ram Properties (P) Ltd. (supra), from the date of the decree of eviction, the tenant is liable to pay mesne profits or compensation for use and occupation of the premises at the same rate at which the landlord would have been able to let out the premises and earn rent if the tenant would have vacated the premises. The landlord is not bound by the contractual rate of rent effective for the period preceding the date of the decree."
The bench observed that the High Court was required to determine the compensation at the same rate at which the landlord would have been able to let out the premises and earn rent if the tenant would have vacated the premises. The court, while remanding the case back to High Court, observed thus:
In a revision / appeal preferred by the tenant, who has suffered an eviction decree, the appellate / revisional court while staying the eviction decree can direct the tenant to pay the compensation for use and occupation of the tenancy premises upon the contractual rate of rent and such compensation for use and occupation of the premises would be at the same rate at which the landlord would have been able to let out the premises and earn rent if the tenant would have vacated the premises.

The Kerala High Court has recently held that mere reference of a party for settlement under Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure would not entitle refund of court fee as provided under Section 69A of the Kerala Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act, unless it has been settled between the parties. 
Justice A. Badharudeen held that although settlement of disputes dealt under Section 89 of CPC includes `arbitration' as well, a party is not entitled to get a refund of the court fee merely because they were referred to arbitration under Section 69 of the Act.
"Section 69A of the Act makes the position without any iota of doubt that refund of court fee is provided only when a court proceeding is settled by recourse to Section 89 of C.P.C and refund is not permissible on the mere reference of parties. Thus it is clear that mere reference of parties by different modes of settlement provided under Section 89 of C.P.C is not sufficient to refund the entire court fee paid as contended, and the statutory mandate is settlement of the dispute by recourse to Section 89 of C.P.C."
The petitioner was the plaintiff in a suit before the Additional Sub Court. He approached the High Court seeking modification of the Sub Judge's order referring the parties for arbitration after closing the suit, without an order for a refund of 1/10th court fee paid by him in the suit.
Advocates Shibu Joseph and Ajith Viswanathan appearing for the petitioner argued that he had paid 1/10 court fee at the time of institution of the suit and that since the parties were referred to arbitration, he is entitled to get a return of the same. It was submitted that there is no direct provision in the Act enabling the return of 1/10 court fee paid but emphasis was laid on Section 69A of the Act to canvass this refund, apart from Section 89 of CPC. The petitioner added that there was no decision on this point. 
The Court noted that a plain reading of Section 69A would make it clear that when a proceeding before any court is settled by recourse to Section 89 of C.P.C, the whole court fee paid shall be refunded except in interlocutory matters. Thus it was clear that Section 69A of the Act would come into play only when the case is settled by recourse to Section 89 of C.P.C.
Further, the proviso to Section 69 states that no refund shall be ordered where only one-tenth of the amount of fee on plaint has been paid by the parties. 
The petitioner had also relied on Manilal Panicker S. v. Titto Abraham to contend that where a compromise or settlement has been arrived at the Lok Adalat in a case referred to it, the entire court fee paid shall be refunded in the manner provided under Central Court Fees Act. However, the Court pointed out that it has been held specifically that the right to refund the court fee, by virtue of Section 21 of Legal Services Authorities Act would accrue only on settlement or compromise.
"Be it so, it cannot be said that mere reference of parties for arbitration or other modes of settlement provided under Section 89 of C.P.C by itself is sufficient to refund the court fee paid by the parties, either in full or 1/10 or 1/3, as the case may be. There shall be a settlement in view of the reference and in such cases alone refund provided under Section 69A of the Kerala Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act can be resorted to."
The Judge noted that the petitioner had not produced any materials to substantiate the fact that on reference to arbitration, the dispute was settled. Therefore, the petition was dismissed, finding no fault with the order of the Munsiff in any manner. 
Case Title: K.K Ibrahim v. Cochin Kaagaz 

The Bangalore Bench of Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) consisting of S.K. Mohanty (Judicial Member) and P.Anjani Kumar (Technical Member) has held that any compensation paid by the employee to the employer for resigning from the service without giving the requisite notice, would not be termed as consideration for the contract of employment and would not fall within the preview of taxable service.
 The appellants/assessee collected an amount as 'Notice Period Pay' or 'Bond Enforcement Amount 'from their employees who wanted to quit the job without notice or did not serve the organisation for the prescribed period as per terms of the employment contract. During the course of an audit of records maintained by the appellants, it was observed by the Department that the appellants did not pay service tax on the consideration received on account of 'notice pay' from the employees. 
 The Department determined that the appellant's activity falls under the definition of declared service, as defined in Section 66E(e) of the Finance Act of 1994 Accordingly, show-cause proceedings were initiated against the appellants, which culminated in the adjudication order in which the service tax demands were confirmed along with interest and penalty. 
 On appeal against the adjudication order, the Commissioner (Appeals) has upheld the adjudication orders and rejected the appeals filed by the appellants. Feeling aggrieved with the impugned orders, the appellants have preferred these appeals before the Tribunal.
 The appellants contended that, in the absence of any taxable service provided by the appellants to their employees, the mere recovery of notice pay from the latter will not be subject to service tax levy under Section 66E. The notice pay recovered from the employees was towards the compensation for non-performance according to the desired level and cannot be equated with the phrase "consideration" as defined in the statute. 
 The CESTAT has held that the term 'notice pay' mentioned in the employment contract cannot be considered as a service, more specifically as a taxable service, inasmuch as neither of the parties to the contract have provided any service to each other. Thus, the phrases "service" defined in Section 65B (44) and "declared service" as defined in Section 65B (22) are not applicable for consideration of such activity as a service for the purpose of levying service tax. The amount received as compensation by the appellants cannot be equated with the term 'consideration' as the latter is received for performance under the contract, whereas the former is received if the other party fails to perform as per the contractual norms. 
 The tribunal relied on the decision of the Madras High Court in the case of GE T & D India Limited, in which it was held that in the absence of rendition of any taxable service, the amount received as consideration cannot be termed as a taxable service for the purpose of the levy of service tax.
