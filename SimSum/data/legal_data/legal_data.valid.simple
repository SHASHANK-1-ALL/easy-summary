The Himachal Pradesh High Court recently observed that reservation may be equated with crutches which are not necessitated to be provided to healthy people but definitely to those who are not able or permitted to stand on their legs or whose legs are weak for deprivation of healthy atmosphere and equal status in the society. Therefore, there is no provision for providing separate reservation to all sections of society, it clarified.
The observations were made Hon’ble Justice Vivek Singh Thakur while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had assailed action of respondents-State, allowing respondent No.5 to contest and thereafter elect her as President of Municipal Council Dehra, District Kangra against the seat reserved for Women (General), on the ground that respondent No.5 Sunita Kumari, for belonging to a Scheduled Caste category, was not eligible to contest and seek election as President/Chairperson, which was reserved for Women belonging to General Category. 
The petitioner contended that the respondent No.5 belongs to Scheduled Caste category, whereas post of Chairperson was reserved for Women belonging to General Category and, therefore, the petitioner claimed that a woman belonging to Scheduled Caste category, despite elected as Member from a Ward reserved for women belonging to General Category, cannot be permitted to contest the election for the office of Chairperson/ President of Municipal Council reserved for Women belonging to General Category. 
The petitioner contended that a post reserved for Women of General Category means a post reserved for all women, but excluding the women belonging to reserved category.
Adjudicating upon the matter in controversy the bench observed, 
"Reservation is for women but not for General Category. ‘General Category’ means ‘all’ and ‘reservation for all’ makes no sense. Thus appropriate meaning of ‘General Category’ is open for all".
Expounding on the law that premise reservations the court said that reservation has been provided exercising power under Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution and while Clauses (3) and (4) of Article 15 of Constitution empower the State to provide reservation for socially and educationally backward classes of citizens, for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and women. There is no provision in the Constitution to provide reservation to General Category. 
"As a matter of fact "General Category” means all classes, including the categories for whom reservation has been provided. Seats meant for General Category cannot be filled by excluding any person of any category who is otherwise eligible and entitled for that on his own merit", Justice Thakur underscored. 
Observing that the seats ‘open to all’ or meant for “General Category” are available to all sections of the society, including the section to whom Vertical Reservation has been provided, the bench explained that the “Open Category” or “General Category” is not a category remained after subtracting the categories to whom Vertical Reservation has been provided but Open or General Category includes all, irrespective of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Everybody is free to compete and contest, on his/her own merit, including categories provided benefit of Vertical Reservation, it added. 
Deliberating further the court elucidated the law that a man or a woman may be eligible to contest election from more than one seat, in different capacity, as a candidate belonging to reserved category can contest election for a seat meant for General Category as well as reserved category, and such person shall also be entitled to contest the election of Member or office of President/Chairperson of the Municipality in either capacity.
"Therefore, respondent No.5 was eligible to contest and hold the post of President/Chairperson of the Municipality reserved for ‘women’ belonging to General Category", the bench maintained. 
Accordingly the bench dismissed the petition finding it devoid of any merit.

The Supreme Court observed that there is a fundamental flaw in the policy of granting licence on the First Come First Serve basis.It is the solemn duty of the State to ensure that a non-­discriminatory method is adopted, whether it is for distribution or allotment of licence on his own land, or alienation of property, the bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S.

The Supreme Court observed that there is a fundamental flaw in the policy of granting licence on the First Come First Serve basis.
It is the solemn duty of the State to ensure that a non-­discriminatory method is adopted, whether it is for distribution or allotment of licence on his own land, or alienation of property, the bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S. Oka observed.
In this case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court held that the policy adopted by the State authorities for the grant of licence on the principle of First Come First Serve basis for the Scheme of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975 cannot be held to be fair, reasonable and transparent method. The court observed that it led to an unholy race amongst the applicants in achieving their goal of obtaining grant of licence.
Before the Apex Court, some of the parties whose licence were cancelled due to this High court judgment, contended that the policy for grant of licence on First Come First Serve basis was a long standing practice followed by the authorities and the licence was to be granted to the incumbent of its own land in terms of the parameters which have been laid down under the policy. 
The court found that there is no such consistent practice as alleged of First Come First Serve basis for allotment of licence available under the entire Scheme placed on record and secondly, from where this principle has been borrowed is alien to the statute and also the policy pursuant to which the process was initiated for allotment of licences to the prospective applicants.
Therefore, the court observed that the principle of First Come First Serve basis which has been adopted by the State Respondents in the  facts of the instant case is neither held to be rational nor in public interest and is in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The court said:
36. That apart, there is a fundamental flaw in the policy of the State of First Come First Serve basis as it involves an element of pure chance or accident and it indeed has inherent in­built implications and this factor cannot be ruled out as we have gone through the record, any person who has an access to the power corridors will be made available with an information from the Government records and before there could be a public notice accessible to the people at large, the interested person may submit his application, as happened in the instant case, and become entitled to stand first included in queue to have a better claim, at  the same time it is the solemn duty of the State to ensure that a non-­discriminatory method is adopted, whether it is for distribution or allotment of licence on his own land, or alienation of property and it is imperative and of paramount consideration that every action of the State should always be in public interest.
Observing thus, the bench upheld the High Court judgment.

The Gujarat High Court has dismissed the appeal of the Appellant-Authorities and confirmed the order of the acquittal by the lower Court on the grounds that the Respondent-Accused was not made aware of his right for being searched before the Magistrate, thereby breaching Section 50 of the NDPS Act.
 The Bench comprising Justice SH Vora and Justice Sandeep Bhatt said,
"IO while acting on prior information and before making search of a person, it is imperative for him to inform the respondent-accused about his right to sub-section (1) of Section 50 of the NDPS Act for being taken to the nearest Gazetted Officer or the Magistrate for making search in their presence. It also appears that neither such procedure is followed..."
The Authorities herein recovered 1 kilogram and 490 grams of charas from the Accused without him having a valid pass or permit. Consequently, a complaint was registered for offences under Section 20, 21 and 22 of the NDPS Act and Section 66(B) and 65(E) of the Prohibition Act.
 Pursuant to this, the case was committed to the Sessions Court wherein the Prosecution put forth various incriminating circumstances and witnesses as under Section 313 of CrPC. The Accused denied all accusations. Subsequently, he was acquitted on the ground that the Prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.
 The Bench observed that the acquittal was made basis the non-compliance of mandatory provisions of NDPS Act on part of the investigating agency. The Sessions Court had also noted that the quantity of the charas was not weighed before the Accused which was an "irregularity". The Court had also cast doubt on the sealing of the cloth bag containing charas. Considering these circumstances, the Accused was acquitted, the Bench noted.
 The High Court remarked that it was imperative for the Accused to be informed about his rights under Section 50(1) of the NDPS Act for being taken to the nearest Gazetted Officer or Magistrate for search in their presence. Reference was made to State Of Punjab vs Baldev Singh [1999 (6) SCC 172] wherein it was held:
 "The respondent-accused must be made aware of his right for being search to be carried out in presence of a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate."
 Further, on perusal of the deposition of PW9, there was no evidence that Section 50 was complied with. Significantly, no intimation was sent to the Superior Officer nor was any entry made in the station diary about recovery of the muddamal. An additional point noted by the Court was that though 40 grams were recovered, only 28.526 grams were received by the Forensics Lab and no explanation was presented for this anomaly before the Courts. Per the Bench, the stitching of the cloth bag was also doubtful. Hence, the Sessions Court had rightly acquitted the Accused by granting benefit of doubt.
 The High Court relied on Ram Kumar v. State of Haryana to aver, "It is settled law that if the main grounds on which the lower Court has based its order acquitting the accused are reasonable and plausible, and the same cannot entirely and effectively be dislodged or demolished, the High Court should not disturb the order of acquittal."
 Accordingly, the Bench refused to interfere with the order of acquittal and dismissed the appeal.
 Case Title: STATE OF GUJARAT Versus UGAMSINH DHANRAJSINH
 Case No.: R/CR.A/942/1994

The Delhi High Court has held that speedy trial form an intrinsic part of Article 21 of the Constitution and the denial of same may be a ground for bail in certain circumstances.

The Delhi High Court has held that speedy trial form an intrinsic part of Article 21 of the Constitution and the denial of same may be a ground for bail in certain circumstances. 
The single judge bench comprising Justice Jasmeet Singh noted that denial of bail without any possibility of the trial concluding anytime soon would cause an infringement of the accused person's right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. Since the case was instituted under the NDPS Act, the court also recorded satisfaction regarding twin conditions for bail under Section 37 of the Act. 
Briefly, the facts of the case are that an application was filed seeking release of an accused under the NDPS Act on regular bail till final disposal of the case registered by the CBI.
The applicant had been in judicial custody since 2016 and as per the application, she was covered by the Supreme Court judgement of Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee (Representing undertrial prisoners) vs. Union of India which held that undertrials cannot indefinitely be detained pending trial.
The Applicant's counsel submitted that in terms of this judgment where an undertrial prisoner is charged with an offence under the Act with minimum imprisonment of 10 years and minimum fine of 1 lakh, such an undertrial prisoner may be released on bail if he has been in jail for not less than 5 years subject to conditions prescribed in the said judgment
The CBI argued that the said observations were only a "one time measure" passed in peculiar circumstances of that case and thus, it would not be applicable in the case of the Applicant.
While analysing the judgement, the High Court opined that the Supreme Court's direction was not a one-time measure but was meant to apply as one-time measure in all cases where the undertrials were in jail and the conclusion of their trial was nowhere in sight. 
High Court further noted that the Supreme Court had made it clear that its observations were not intended to interfere with Special Courts power to grant bail under Section 37 of the NDPS Act. This means that the Special Courts under Section 37 can grant bail and are at liberty to grant bail even prior to having undergone half of the minimum sentence. Further, the Special Courts are always free to cancel the bail if the accused is found to be misusing the liberty of bail.
The court noted that no prisoner should be denied their life and liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India especially when speedy trial cannot be guaranteed and there is no end in sight for the trial.
"It, therefore, is clear that speedy trial forms an intrinsic part of Article 21 of the Constitution and the denial of same may be a ground for bail in certain circumstances/conditions."
While discussing the merits of the case, the court stated that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant was not guilty of the offence. Further, the court added that the applicant was not likely to commit an offence under the NDPS Act while on bail. Thus, the accused crossed the hurdle of the stringent twin conditions for bail under Section 37 of NDPS act.
It was further noted that whether she was guilty or not needed to be decided in the trial, where the intricacies of the alleged crime were to be delved into deeper by the trial court and the guilt or liability, if any, could be decided after the trial.
However, the court opined that if bail was denied without any possibility of the trial concluding anytime soon, it would be infringing upon her right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. 
Thus, noting that the applicant had undergone half of the minimum 10 years prescribed in the NDPS Act, the Court directed to enlarge her on bail upon furnishing personal bond of Rs. 1 lakh with two sureties.
CASE TITLE: GURMITO v. CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

The Allahabad High Court has rejected the bail application filed by Anand Giri, the prime accused in the alleged suicidal death of Mahant Narendra Giri who was the President of Akhil Bhartiya Akhada Parishad as well as the Mahant/Head of Shri Math "Baghambari Gaddi", Allahpur, Prayagraj and "Shri Bade/Lete Hanuman Ji Temple", Prayagraj.The Bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar Singh observed that...
The Allahabad High Court has rejected the bail application filed by Anand Giri, the prime accused in the alleged suicidal death of Mahant Narendra Giri who was the President of Akhil Bhartiya Akhada Parishad as well as the Mahant/Head of Shri Math "Baghambari Gaddi", Allahpur, Prayagraj and "Shri Bade/Lete Hanuman Ji Temple", Prayagraj.
The Bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar Singh observed that the materials collected by the C.B.I. during the investigation indicated that on account of the acts of Anand Giri (booked for abetting suicide) and coaccused, the deceased was put under tremendous pressure to die by suicide.
"The conduct of the applicant and his accomplices was such that the deceased because of fear of his slander was left with no other option, but to end his life. The manner in which the deceased committed suicide, prima facie, indicates that the same is the outcome of cumulative effect of series of acts of accused persons as mentioned above. The conduct of the applicant and his accomplices was such that the deceased because of fear of his slander was left with no other option, but to end his life. The manner in which the deceased committed suicide, prima facie, indicates that the same is the outcome of cumulative effect of series of acts of accused persons as mentioned above."
The case in brief
Essentially, Mahant Narendra Giri (72) was found dead inside his room at the Baghambari Math in UP's Pyayagraj on September 20, 2022, and the names of the accused Giri and one Adya Tiwari had surfaced in an alleged suicide note which is said to have been written by the Hindu saint shortly before he died by suicide.
The letter, allegedly written by Mahant Narendra Giri stated that he feared that Anand Giri would circulate a morphed photo of him with a woman to defame him and that it won't be possible for him to give an explanation. He had also expressed that he was deeply disturbed by Anand Giri's false allegations of financial irregularities against him.
The FIR registered against Anand Giri (booking him under Section 306 of IPC) states that Mahant Narendra himself used to say that he is being troubled by Anand Giri. Accused Anand Giri had developed grudges against Mahant Giri after Mahant Giri had removed him as his successor on account of the arrest and involvement of Anand Giri in molestation cases in Australia.
Anand Giri was also removed from "Baghambari Gaddi", Prayagraj as well as from "Shri Bade/Lete Hanuman Ji Temple", Prayagraj, and subsequently, he was also expelled from "Niranjani Akhada" for a period of three years on the persuasion of Mahant Narendra Giri.
CBI, which is probing the matter alleged that accused persons namely Anand Giri, Adhya Prasad Tiwari, and Sandeep Tiwari along with their other associates in collusion with each other adopted different modus–Operandi to hatch a criminal conspiracy and mount pressure upon Mahant Narendra Giri making his character assassination.
The same was doned primarily with a motive to compel Mahant Narendra Giri to revoke the expulsion of accused Anand Giri from Niranjani Akhada
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court observed that the matters of suicide in each case has to be decided on the basis of its own facts and circumstances and that if the accused kept on mental torture the deceased by words, deeds, or conduct, which may provoke, urge or encourage the deceased to commit suicide, then the act may be a form of abetment.
Against this backdrop, the Court found a proximate link between the unfortunate incident of the suicide of Mahant Narendra Giri and acts of the accused persons and their other concerned associates. 
"Though Mahant Narendra Giri has died because of hanging, but facts of the case reflect that he was a hypersensitive man and considering his post and position in the society...(he) was very much depressed on account of the reason that if Anand Giri (accused) makes his edited obscene video with a girl viral, then he will not be able to show his face in the society and feels humiliated among his known persons and in the society on account of his character assassination by the accused persons and to avoid defamation and insult in the eyes of society, his followers and devotees, he has committed suicide. The said facts are corroborated by the suicide note written by the deceased and the video made by the deceased just before his death as well as other attending circumstances mentioned above. The deceased in his suicide note and video has disclosed the reasons and other compelling circumstances implicating Anand Giri, which prevailed upon him for committing suicide. At this stage, there is no reason to disbelieve the suicide note and video made by the deceased just before his death. Normally it is presumed that no one tells a lie while dying by committing suicide. Thus, abetment of suicide by Anand Giri and his associates, cannot be ruled out at this stage," the Court remarked as it denied bail to accused Anand Giri.
Significantly, the Court took into account an audio clip filed by the CBI wherein the accused was talking to two of his associates using vulgar language related to debauchery, womanizing, and sex. Observing that such vulgar conversations cannot be expected from a man who claims himself to be a sage or religious/spiritual guru in a real sense, the Court emphasized that this reflected Anand Giri's dual personality in the guise of wearing a religious cloak.
"This Court is of the view that the conduct of any person should be in accordance with the dignity of his position. The higher the position, the greater the responsibility. A man is also known by the company he keeps in society," the Court further remarked.
Case title - Anand Giri alias Ashok Kumar Chotiya v. State of U.P. and another [CRIMINAL MISC. BAIL APPLICATION NO. 51323 of 2021]

A suggestion put by an accused to the complainant during cross-examination doesn't create a right in the complainant's favour to seek his own re-examination under section 311 of the CrPC, especially after he was allowed to testify the first time using the same provision, the Bombay High Court has held.
 Justice Amit Borkar therefore quashed a Magistrate's order allowing the complainant's application under section 311 of the CrPC to produce two invoices in a cheque bouncing case under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881. 
 "The discretion has to be exercised by the Court judiciously to prevent injustice unless there are tangible reasons to show how fairness of trial suffered without recall," the court observed.
 Facts 
 The petitioner was the original accused in the cheque bouncing proceeding. During trial the complainant examined himself and during cross-examination stated that he had documentary evidence showing the transactions between the complainant and accused. Following the examination, the accused's statement under 313 of the CrPC was recorded. 
 Subsequently the complainant filed a second application for producing the invoices, which was allowed by the court. The accused filed an appeal in the High Court against this order. 
 Advocates for the accused Adithya R. Iyer along with Nyayesh Bharucha & Advit Helekar submitted that the statement made in the cross-examination cannot be the basis to recall the witnesses. He further submitted that the proceeding was fixed for final argument and at that stage allowing application would amount to fill up lacunae.
 The complainant's advocate submitted that the accused having called upon the complainant to produce invoices, the application was filed and, therefore, the Magistrate was justified in allowing the application. 
 At the outset the court said that in light of the factual scenario, "the suggestion in the cross-examination by the accused wherein the complainant shown his willingness to produce on record the invoices does not create any right in favour of the complainant to file an application under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973."
 The court added that one opportunity was already given to the complainant by passing the order dated 15th November 2021 whereby an earlier application under Section 311 of CrPC was allowed by the Magistrate.
 "It is well settled law that the power under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 has been conferred on the learned Magistrate for advancing justice only in a case where the application is bona fide. The delay in trial is also relevant factor."
 The court further observed that the invoices cannot only be submitted but will have to be proved with the complainant's testimony which will amount to a "re-trial." "Therefore, in my opinion, the learned Magistrate was not justified in allowing the application," the court held. 
 "Merely because certain suggestions in the cross-examination are raised on behalf of the accused, does not create right in favour of the complainant to file such application, particularly when the complainant had exercised right under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 on earlier occasion," the bench re-iterated.

The Tripura High Court has on Friday observed that the citizens of the State as well as of the country should not suffer on account of a faulty system and faulty software developed by the Government of India for issuing death certificates.
 The Bench of Justice Arindam Lodh was hearing the plea of one Abhijit Gon Chowdhury whose wife died in Bangalore and he had applied to the Agartala Municipal Corporation for issuance of the death certificate of his wife by submitting all the necessary documents.
 It was his specific plea before the Court that despite the fact that over 3 months had passed since his wife died, he had not been issued the death certificate by the Municipal Corporation.
 The Municipal Corporation attributed the delay to the software developed by the Government of India, and introduced in Agartala Municipal Corporation by claiming that the system was not allowing the entry or to record the name of the person, who died at a place outside Agartala Municipal Corporation.
 To this, the High Court, at the outset, directed the Agartala Municipal Corporation to issue death certificate within 48 hours by any means whatsoever.
 "…it may be by manual exercise also or by any modes under which the AMC used to issue death certificate earlier i.e. before installation of the present software," the Court directed.
 Further, the Court also remarked that if it finds similar petition filed by any of the citizens of this State, then, a cost of Rs. 5 lakh will be imposed. 
 Lastly, the State-government was directed to take up the matter with the concerned authorities of the Union of India to resolve the issue so that the citizens of this country may not face any harassment.
 With these observations and directions, the instant writ petition stood allowed and disposed of.
 Case title - Sri Abhijit Gon Chowdhury v. The State of Tripura and 3 others
Read Order

The Supreme Court observed that an earlier suit which was dismissed for technical reasons would not operate as Res Judicata.
In this case, the Plaintiff temple filed a suit in 1981 for appointment of the receiver for preparing an inventory of the suit jewellery. This suit was not decided on merits but was dismissed on the ground that the plaintiff had prayed for mandatory injunction and had not made a prayer for declaration of title. Later, in 1990, the temple filed a suit for declaration of existence of specific endowment in respect of the suit jewellery in favour of the deity, Sri Neelayadhakshi Amman, and for a decree of permanent injunction restraining the defendant from interfering with the right of the deity to take out the suit jewellery from the Kudavarai. The Trial Court rejected the contention of the defendant that the suit for declaration was barred under Order II Rule 2 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Res judicata). The First Appellate Court, held in favour of defendant-appellant and observed that the Temple had omitted to seek a declaration as to the ownership of the suit jewellery and as such the Temple was barred from filing a suit for declaration of the suit jewellery as a specific endowment. In Second appeal filed by the Plaintiff temple, the High Court restored the Trial Court decree and set aside the judgment of First Appellate Court.
Therefore, the issue raised by the defendant- appellant before the Apex Court was whether the Suit of 1990 was hit by principles of Res Judicata?
The court noted that the suit filed in 1981 for appointment of the receiver for preparing an inventory of the suit jewellery was not decided on merits but was dismissed on the ground that the respondent had prayed for mandatory injunction and had not made a prayer for declaration of title.
"Thus, the suit was dismissed for technical reasons, which decision is not an adjudication on merits of the dispute that would operate as res judicata on the merits of the matter"
The court observed that for res judicata to apply, the earlier suit should have been decided on merits and the decision should have attained finality. It said
"Where the former suit is dismissed by the trial court for want of jurisdiction, or for default of the plaintiff's appearance, or on the ground of non-joinder or mis-joinder of parties or multifariousness, or on the ground that the suit was badly framed, or on the ground of a technical mistake, or for failure on the part of the plaintiff to produce probate or letter of administration or succession certificate when the same is required by law to entitle the plaintiff to a decree, or for failure to furnish security for costs, or on the ground of improper valuation, or for failure to pay additional court fee on a plaint which was undervalued, or for want of cause of action, or on the ground that it is premature and the dismissal is confirmed in appeal (if any), the decision, not being on the merits, would not be res judicata in a subsequent suit."
The Court also noted that the defendant-appellant did not place on record a copy of the pleadings and the judgments passed, including the appellate judgment which has attained finality. 
"The party claiming and raising the plea of constructive res judicata/Order II Rule 2 of the Code must place on record in evidence the pleadings of the previous suit and establish the identity of the cause of actions, which cannot be established in the absence of record of judgment and decree which is pleaded to operate as estoppel.", the bench said.
Observing thus, the bench dismissed the appeal.

The Gujarat High Court has held that the Surrogacy Regulation Act, 2021 does not envisage any provision that would require the custody of a new-born child to be retained by the surrogate mother for a particular period of time, for the purpose of breastfeeding. 
A division bench of Justice Vipul M. Pancholi and Justice Sandeep N. Bhatt held that the court must interpret the law as it stands and not on considerations of perceived morality. Thus, a new-born child could be handed over to the intended parents even without a court order, in lieu of the provisions of the Surrogacy Regulation Act, 2021 and the surrogacy agreement signed between the parties.
 The petitioners in this matter were a married couple who had decided to go for surrogacy in order to become parents. Accordingly, they entered into the agreement with a woman who agreed to become a surrogate mother for the couple. It was decided that immediately after the birth of the child, the custody of the child would be handed over to the petitioners i.e. the intended parents. Before the due date of the delivery, the surrogate mother was arrested by the police due to an FIR lodged against her. Thereafter, she delivered a baby girl. 
 The petitioners conveyed to the medical staff and the police officers that as per the surrogacy agreement the surrogate mother was under obligation to hand over the custody of the newly born child to them. Accordingly, the custody was given to the petitioners in presence of the medical staff and the concerned doctor. However, the concerned medical officer and staff of the civil hospital asked the petitioners to bring back the child to the civil hospital as the Respondent, i.e. Superintendent of Police, Sabarmati jail was insisting for the custody of the child. This was despite the surrogate mother confirming the contents of the surrogacy agreement and consenting to giving the custody of the child to the petitioners. 
 The Assistant Public Prosecutor, while throwing light upon the legal provisions pertaining to the issue stated that the Surrogacy Regulation Act, 2021 had no provision requiring that for a particular period, the custody of the child was to be retained by the surrogate mother for the purpose of breastfeeding. However, as per the National Guidelines on Infant and Young child Feeding issued by the Ministry of Human Resource Development Department of Women and Child Development (Food and Nutrition Board), Government of India, the APP stated, there was a reference with regard to the importance of breast feeding of the child for first six months from the date of birth. 
 The ground on which the respondents were refusing to grant the custody of the newly born child to the petitioners was that there was no order of the Court for the same and therefore, as the surrogate mother was required to be sent to judicial custody, the custody of the newly born child would not be handed over to the petitioners. 
 The court relied upon Clause 1(J), Clause 1(O), Clause 6(B), Section 2(zd) and Section 8 Surrogacy Regulation Act, 2021 and the agreement entered into between the parties to state that–
 "It is clear that after giving birth to the child, the respondent no.5 is required to hand over the custody of the newly born child to the present petitioners who are intended parents and child born out of the surrogacy procedure shall be deemed to be the biological child of the intended couple and the said child shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges available to a natural child under any law for the time being in force."
 The court also relied upon the case of Navjot Singh Sidhu v/s State of Punjab and Another (2007) 2 SCC 574, wherein the Supreme Court stated that the Courts have to interpret the law as it stands and not on considerations which may be perceived to be morally more correct or ethical. 
 Thus, in absence of any provision contained in the Surrogacy Regulation Act, 2021 providing that for the purpose of breast feeding, the custody of the child was to be retained by the surrogate mother for a particular period, the Court held that the custody of the corpus i.e. newly born child was required to be handed over to the intended parents/petitioners.
Case Title : ENA W/O ASHISH JAIN Versus STATE OF GUJARAT

The insurer must establish that there was willful breach on part of the insured.The Delhi High Court has observed that the insurance company cannot avoid it's liability of compensating the deceased's family, even if the offending vehicle was stolen and was being unauthorisedly driven by someone else.

The Delhi High Court has observed that the insurance company cannot avoid it's liability of compensating the deceased's family, even if the offending vehicle was stolen and was being unauthorisedly driven by someone else. Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva added that in order to avoid the liability, the insurer must establish that there was a willful breach on the part of the insured. Accordingly, the Court upheld the order passed by the Tribunal which had directed the insurance company pay the compensation amount and recover the same from the driver who had stolen the vehicle. An appeal was filed challenging the award passed by the Tribunal to the limited extent that it granted recovery rights against the driver of the vehicle. It was the case of the appellant that since the vehicle was stolen and driver was a professional thief, there was no liability on the insurance company to pay the amount. The case was that one Eeco Car was being driven in a rash and negligent manner by the driver which hit a scooty of the decease with great force, as a result of the forceful impact deceased fell down and sustained fatal injuries. The tribunal had found that the offending vehicle was stolen by the driver and a complaint was already lodged with Police Station with regards to the theft of the offending vehicle. The vehicle was insured with the appellant. The Court therefore dealt with the question as to whether the insurance company is absolved of the liability to pay the amount in a case where the vehicle is stolen and unauthorisedly being driven by somebody else? The Court relied on the Supreme Court judgment in United India Insurance Company vs. Lehru and Ors, 2003(3) SCC 338 which held that in order to avoid the liability, the insurer must establish that there was a willful breach on the part of the insured. "Admittedly in the present case the insurance company has not been able to show any breach on the part of the insured to avoid its liability," the Court said. The Court disagreed with the judgment delivered by the Madras High Court in New India Assurance Co Ltd vs. Selvarajamani & Ors relied on by the appellant. "Said judgment does not consider the proposition as laid down by the Supreme Court in Lehru (supra) as to whether there is a willful breach on the part of the insured or not so as to entitle the insurer to avoid the liability," the Court opined. It further said:
"Furthermore, if the proposition of the insurance company was accepted, it would militate against the very concept of a beneficial legislation for the victims of an accident. If such a finding were to be returned then the effect would be that even though a vehicle is insured but is stolen, not only would the insurance company be entitled to avoid its liability but the owner of the vehicle who has insured his vehicle against theft and accident would be saddled with a liability for no fault of his. Alternatively, the claimants would be left without any remedy to seek compensation." "In view of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Lehru (supra), which lays down that unless the insurance company is able to show that there is a willful breach of the policy on the part of the insured, insurance company cannot avoid its liability." The Court took note of the fact that the Tribunal had found that the vehicle was stolen and that there was no willful breach of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy by the insured. "Accordingly, I find no infirmity in impugned award whereby the Tribunal has directed the insurance company to make the payment of the compensation amount and thereafter recover the same from the driver Niraj @ Mika who had stolen the vehicle," the Court said while upholding the impugned order.

The Delhi High Court has held that the Rights of Persons With Disability Act, 2016 Act or the Rules framed thereunder do not create any embargo on the exercise of parens patriae jurisdiction by it under Article 226 of the Constitution.
"So long as the "wills and preferences" of the mentally ill person and the other factors set out in the rules are borne in mind by the Court exercising parens patriae jurisdiction, it cannot be held that the High Court exercising power under Article 226 is denuded of power in view of the provisions of the RPWD-2016 Act or the Rules thereunder," observed Justice Pratibha M Singh.
The Bench was dealing with a petition filed by 76 year-old lady and wife of a mentally ill individual (Mr. DMP) diagnosed with Fronto-temporal Dementia in 2019. He was a 7th term Member of Parliament from Bihar and owned moveable and immoveable assets running into more than Rs.3,000 crores or more. The man had been living in his official residence along with a lady claiming to be his wife and his daughter- in-law from his deceased son.
While one group consisted of Mr. DMP's companion, his brother, his daughter-in- law from his deceased son and her children, the second group consisted of his wife, his two sons and their wives as well as his four grandsons.
The Court therefore dealt with the questions as to who would be the guardian for Mr. DMP, who should take decisions relating to his medical treatment and who should be given control of his movable and immovable assets and other financial affairs. 
While the Court deliberated on the issue of medical condition of Mr. DMP, it also touched upon the legal aspects concerning the legislative framework for Mentally Ill Persons and Guardianship, interplay between the Mental Healthcare Act 2017 and the Rights of Persons with Disability Act 2016 and also the analysis on Guardianship.
While going through the Indian laws as well as the international convention on the subject, the Court highlighted certain concerns with regards to Rights of Persons With Disabilities Act 2016 and Mental Healthcare Act 2017. The said concerns were also expressed by legislators, when the bills of the two statutes were being debated and discussed in the Parliament. 
"That the details regarding the guardianship of mentally ill persons and management of their property were provided for only in the MHA-1987, which would be repealed by the enactment of the Mental Healthcare Bill, 2013 (hereinafter, 'MHA Bill 2013'). Such guardianship provisions were absent in the MHA Bill 2013 and were only provided for in the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2014 (hereinafter, 'RPWD Bill') which was still being debated in the Parliament," the Court said. 
The Court also added that the statutes were recent and various institutions contemplated under them were yet to be completely established.
In this backdrop, the Court was of the view that the Mental Healthcare Act 2017 has to be interpreted as having been enacted only to deal with the delivery of mental healthcare, and services and for connected matters. 
"The deletion of provisions with respect to property and affairs and the absence of any provisions in respect of moveable or immovable assets, financial affairs, legal capacity, legal aid, etc. in the said statute is clearly a conscious departure from the earlier regime. Such issues are dealt with under the RPWD-2016," the Court added. 
On the aspect of guardianship, the Court opined that credence has to be given to the views of the person with mental illness to the extent that the person understands the nature of the decisions. It was therefore observed that the treatment and healthcare to be given to the mentally ill person has to be in the particular context of that person's life history
"Thus, it is clear that under the MHA-2017, while appointing a nominated representative, a relative by blood or marriage or adoption under Section 14(4)(b), is given precedence over a care-giver under Section 14(4)(c). The measures taken qua the mentally ill person ought to be acceptable to the family members, who cannot be ignored," the Court said. 
The Court also held that the intention of the RPWD Act 2016, is to first examine if the PwD is capable of expressing his or her will or preferences, and second, under exceptional circumstances, where consultation is not possible, enable the provision of total support.
"The MHA-2017 has no provision in respect of management of financial affairs, appointment of guardians or the manner in which the moveable/immovable property of the mentally ill person is to be taken care of. Thus, there is a clear statutory vacuum," it added further. 
On the exercise of parens patriae jurisdiction, the Court observed that if the Court is satisfied that the person concerned is either being abused or neglected, such a jurisdiction can be exercised. It also added that the "wills and preferences" of the mentally ill person have to be considered by the Court in deciding the manner in which care is to be given.
"Even vulnerable adults can be protected under this jurisdiction if there are any factors that point towards undue influence, coercion, constraint etc," the Court said. 
Applying the aforesaid observations to the facts of the case, the Court observed that the role of the wife is of prime importance and that merely because she is illiterate does not mean that she cannot take care of her husband. 
"Her visits to meet Mr. DMP have been very amicable and congenial. She speaks to Mr. DMP in her own native language and enjoys the confidence of both her sons, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren. She is also involved in the preparations for the marriage of one of the grandsons. These facts show that the position of Mrs. SD, as the wife of Mr. DMP and the primary caregiver deserves to be recognised," the Court said. 
"Thus, this Court is of the opinion that there is a clear need to change the status quo as it exists today. Mr. DMP ought to be permitted to live in a happy and congenial atmosphere with his wife, children and grandchildren. He should also be allowed to enjoy the company of his siblings and extended family, without pressure from any quarter. Ms. UD can continue to live in the residence of Mr. DMP, however, she cannot be given exclusive control of Mr. DMP, as is the position currently," it added. 
The Court also appointed a Guardianship Committee for the purpose of taking care of Mr. DMP and his financial affairs. A medical board was also constituted to examine him at least once a month, which shall be facilitated by the Committee.

 The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Monday ruled that in crimes pertaining to matrimonial disputes and dowry deaths the relatives of the husband should not be roped in on the basis of omnibus allegations unless specific instances of their involvement in the crime are made out.
 The bench comprising Justice Sanjay Dhar was collectively hearing petitions seeking indulgence of the court to invoke its powers under Section 482 of the CrPC for quashing FIR for alleged offences under Section 498A and 406 of IPC. 
 The petitioners in one of the plea happened to be the brother, sister and brother-in-law of the husband of the complainant whereas petitioner in the second plea happened to be the husband of the complainant.
 The petitioners challenged the impugned FIR on the ground that as per own showing of the complainant, she was thrown out of her matrimonial house on 29.09.2015 but she has filed the impugned FIR on 18.10.2021, i.e. more than six years after the occurrence and therefore the instant prosecution is barred in terms of the provisions contained in Section 468 of the CrPC. The petitioners further contended that the impugned FIR and the material collected by the investigating agency during investigation of the case did not disclose commission of any offence by the petitioners and complainant has roped in all the relatives of her husband without there being any specific allegations against them.
 Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Dhar observed that it is clear that on the basis of the omnibus allegations made in the impugned FIR as well as statements of prosecution witnesses recorded during investigation of the case, the petitioners who happen to be relatives of the husband of the complainant, cannot be roped in. 
These allegations are required to be carefully scrutinized before initiation of prosecution against the relatives of the husband and there being no mention of the specific instances of cruelty alleged to have been committed by the relatives of the husband in the instant case, the prosecution against them cannot be sustained, the bench noted. 
 "However, the same cannot be said about the petitioner husband of the complainant, against whom there are specific allegations in the statements of the prosecution witnesses" Justice Dhar observed. 
 In order to buttress the said position of law the bench found it worthwhile to record the observations of the Supreme Court in Rajesh Sharma v. State of U.P, (2018) 10 SCC 472, wherein while dealing with the issue regarding the tendency of aggrieved wives to rope in all the relatives of the husband in the cases relating to matrimonial disputes, it was observed:
 "It is a matter of serious concern that large number of cases continue to be filed under Section 498A alleging harassment of married women. We have already referred to some of the statistics from the Crime Records Bureau. This Court had earlier noticed the fact that most of such complaints are filed in the heat of the moment over trivial issues. Many of such complaints are not bona fide. At the time of filing of the complaint, implications and consequences are not visualized. At times such complaints lead to uncalled for harassment not only to the accused but also to the complainant. Uncalled for arrest may ruin the chances of settlement." 
 Deliberating on the issue the bench also placed strong reliance on Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar, (2014) wherein the Supreme Court recorded its displeasure as under.
 "The fact that Section 498-A is a cognizable and non-bailable offence has lent it a dubious place of pride amongst the provisions that are used as weapons rather than shield by disgruntled wives. The simplest way to harass is to get the husband and his relatives arrested under this provision. In a quite number of cases, bed-ridden grand-fathers and grand-mothers of the husbands, their sisters living abroad for decades are arrested."
 While dealing with the other moot question as to whether it was open to the investigating agency to undertake investigation keeping in view the fact that the alleged acts of misappropriation and cruelty are stated to have taken place about six years prior to the lodging of the FIR, the bench observed Section 468 of the CrPC creates a bar to the taking of cognizance after a lapse of period of limitation and cognizance of an offence is taken only after final report of investigation of the FIR is laid before the Court. 
Registration of an FIR does not amount to taking of cognizance and therefore the bar contained in Section 468 of the CrPC cannot be made applicable to the registration of FIR and undertaking investigation into an offence, the bench underscored.
 For the foregoing reasons the FIR against the relatives of the husband of the complainant was quashed whereas the petition filed by the husband was dismissed as lacking merit. 
 Case Title : Junaid Hassan Masoodi & Ors Vs UT of J&K. 

The Allahabad High Court has quashed a criminal case registered against Congress leader Salman Khurshid for allegedly making an indecent remark against the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath.
During the electioneering for Lok Sabha Election 2019, while referring to Uttar Pradesh's Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Congress leader Khurshid had allegedly said: “Rishte me ham unke Baap Lagte hai".
#JustIn | The #AllahabadHighCourt has quashed the criminal case against Congress leader Salman Khurshid (@salman7khurshid) who was accused of making a remark 'Rishte me ham unke Baap Lagte hain' referring to UP CM Yogi Adityanath (@myogiadityanath) pic.twitter.com/CoWb1HN17D— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) February 15, 2023
While quashing the case proceedings against Khurshid, the bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh observed that sometimes, in the spur of the moment, a person utters something with no intention to hurt the feelings and sentiments of others.
"...and if such a person regrets for making such a statement, the Court should take a larger view of the matter and quash the proceedings. Regret is tough but fair teacher. To live without regret is to believe you have nothing to learn, no amends to make, and no opportunity to be braver with your life," the Court added.
The case in brief
Essentially, Khurshid had moved the High Court seeking to quash the charge sheet (filed in August 2019) as well as the cognizance/summoning order (passed in September 2019) and the entire proceeding of Sessions Trial under Sections 153 A, 171-G IPC and Section 125 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 pending in the court of Special Judge (SC/ST Act), Farrukhabad.
It was the primary argument of the Counsel appearing for Khurshid that the alleged statement was made in a lighter vein which is a famous dialogue of the movie 'Shahanshah' and there was no intention to be disrespectful to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.
In fact, Khurshid also filed a personal affidavit before the Court on Feb 13 expressing regret on the said comment/statement.
In view of the same, observing that Khurshid has an 'appetite to learn and be brave in life', the Court remarked thus:
"In view of the affidavit submitted by Sri Salman Khurshid and considering overall facts and circumstances of the case, the context in which he uttered the offending sentence, and his regret for his comment, I am of the view that the continuation of the impugned proceedings against Sri Salman Khurshid would not be justified."
It may be noted that Court's order notes that the said remark was allegedly made in response to a question being put by the journalists in respect of the statement of the CM of UP wherein he had allegedly said that the Khurshid was a sympathizer of Batla House accused/terrorists.

Case title - Salman Khurshid vs. State of U.P. and Another [APPLICATION U/S 482 No. - 38523 of 2019]

In her dissenting judgment in the pleas challenging demonetisation, Supreme Court judge Justice BV Nagarathna observed that there was no independent application of mind by the Reserve Bank of India in recommending the cancellation of entire Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes as proposed by the Central Government.
Justice Nagarathna formed this opinion after referring to the records relating to the decision submitted by the Union Government and the Reserve Bank of India.
 "On looking at the records( submitted by RBI), I find the use of the words and phrases there "as desired by the Central Govt", "Govt has recommended the withdrawal of legal tender of 500 and 1000 notes", "recommendation has been obtained" etc., are self explanatory. This demonstrates that there was no independent application of mind by the (Reserve) Bank. Neither was there any time for the bank to apply its mind in such a serious issue. This observation is being made having regard to the fact that the entire exercise of demonetisation of all series of bank notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 was carried out in 24 hours", Justice Nagarathna observed.
Justice Nagarathna noted that the proposal originated from the Central Government by way of its letter dated 7 November 2016 addressed to the bank. The recommendation did not originate from the bank under Section 26(2) of the RBI Act but was obtained from the bank by the Central Government. A proposal originating from the Central Government is not akin to a proposal originating from the Central Board of the Bank.
Justice Nagarathna opined that the concurrence given by the RBI to such a proposal cannot be construed as a "recommendation" under Section 26(2) of the RBI Act.
Even assuming for argument sake that the RBI had such a power, Justice Nagarathna held that such a recommendation is void as the power under Section 26(2) can be only for a particular series of currency notes & not for the whole series of currency notes of a denomination. The judge opined that the word "any series" in Section 26(2) of the RBI Act cannot be interpreted to mean "all series" as held by the majority.
Demonetisation of all series of notes at the instance of Central Govt is a far more serious issue than the demonetisation of particular series by the bank. So, it has to be done through legislation than through executive notification, she held.
"Parliament is a miniature of the country.... Parliament which is the centre of democracy cannot be left aloof in a matter of such critical importance", Justice Nagarathna observed in the judgment.
Justice Nagarathna further observed: "The problems associated with the measure of demonetisation would make one wonder whether the Central Board of the Bank visualised the consequences which would follow. Whether the central board of the bank had attempted to take note of the adverse effects of the demonetisation of such a large volume of bank notes in circulation. The objectives of the central board may have been sound, just and proper. But the manner in which the said objects were achieved and the procedure followed were not in accordance with law".
"It has also been brought on record that around 98% of the value of the demonetised currency notes have been exchanged for bank notes which continues to be a legal tender. Also a new series of bank notes for Rs 2000 was released by the bank. This would suggest the measure itself was may not have been proved to be as effective as it was hoped to be. However, this court does not base its decision on the legality of a legislation qua the effectiveness in achieving the stated objectives. Therefore, it is clarified that any relief moulded in the present case is divorced from the consideration of the success of such measures", she said. 
"The opinion of the Central Bank ought to be a frank and independent opinion, after a meaningful discussion with the central board, which ought to be given its true weightage, having regard to the ramifications on the Indian economy and the citizens of India", the judge observed.
Even if the RBI recommends such an action, the Central Government cannot demonetise the entire series of currency notes through an executive notification. It has to be done through a legislative process- either through a law made by the Parliament or an ordinance.
Based on the above reasons, Justice Nagarathna declared the notification dated November 8, 2016 to be "contrary to law" and "unlawful".
"In the circumstances, the action of demonetisation of all currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 is vitiated. Further, the subsequent Ordinance of 2016 and the Act of 2017, incorporating the terms of the impugned notification, are unlawful. However, having regard to the fact that the impugned notification and the Act have been acted upon, the declaration of law will apply prospectively and will not affect any action taken by the Central Government or the RBI pursuant to the notification dated November 8, 2016. Hence, no relief is being granted in the individual petitions".
Justice Nagarathna however added that the measure was well-intentioned to target evils plaguing the nation's economy such as black money, terror funding and counterfeit currency.
"Before parting, I wish to observe that demonetisation was an initiative of the Central Government, targeted to address disparate evils, plaguing the Nation’s economy, including, practices of hoarding “black” money, counterfeiting, which in turn enable even greater evils, including terror funding, drug trafficking, emergence of a parallel economy, money laundering including Havala transactions. It is beyond the pale of doubt that the said measure, which was aimed at eliminating these depraved practices, was well-­intentioned. The measure is reflective of concern for the economic health and security of the country and demonstrates foresight. At no point has any suggestion been made that the measure was motivated by anything but the best intentions and noble objects for the betterment of the Nation. The measure has been regarded as unlawful only on a purely legalistic analysis of the relevant provisions of the Act and not on the objects of demonetisation".

The Delhi High Court has observed that whenever a party claims a change in circumstance after an order granting maintenance has been passed under Section 125 CrPC, the appropriate recourse would be seeking relief under Section 127 of the Code, not filing a fresh petition under Section 125 of the Code.

The Delhi High Court has observed that whenever a party claims a change in circumstance after an order granting maintenance has been passed under Section 125 CrPC, the appropriate recourse would be seeking relief under Section 127 of the Code, not filing a fresh petition under Section 125 of the Code. 
Laying emphasis on the doctrine of res judicata, Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma observed that the said principle has been evolved to prevent multiplicity of litigation regarding the same issues and puts an end to a finally adjudicated issue ensuring finality in litigation.
"This Court notes that a petition under Section 125 Cr.P.C. will be covered by the principle of res judicata due to its universal applicability, as proceedings under Section 125 Cr.P.C. are Quasi- Criminal in nature. Once the petition has been adjudicated under Section 125 Cr.P.C. favourably by a Court of competent jurisdiction on merits, a subsequent petition cannot be preferred which arises from the same dispute having similar situations, circumstances and grounds as the previously adjudicated issues in the earlier petition filed under Section 125 Cr.P.C."
It said whenever a party claims a change in circumstance after an order granting maintenance has been passed under Section 125 CrPC, the appropriate recourse would be a petition under Section 127 CrPC. and not a fresh petition under Section 125 CrPC.
This ensures abuse of process of law and disentitles a litigant to access courts repeatedly agitating issues which have become final between the parties after being adjudicated on merits by a court of law, the court added.
The development ensued while dealing with a plea filed by the wife challenging the order passed by Principal Judge, Family Court in a matrimonial case. Vide the impugned order, the Trial Court had dismissed the maintenance application filed by her on the ground of res judicata.
The ground on which the Trial Court dismissed the wife's application was that prior to the filing of the said petition, the wife along with her two children had filed another petition under Section 125 CrPC which was decided allowing each of the three petitioners a sum of Rs. 500 per month as maintenance.
The High Court observed that the objective of Section 125 CrPC is to ensure financial support to the estranged wife and that the objective is not to punish a person but rather support the relations who have a moral right to be supported. 
"The most important precondition for Section 125 Cr.P.C. to become operative is the condition that the wife is unable to maintain herself and that the husband has neglected or refused to maintain his wife," the Court said. 
The Court further observed that an adjudicated order under Section 125 CrPC is a precondition for making an application under Section 127 CrPC. It added that once an application has been filed under Section 125 and a maintenance amount has been granted, an application under Section 127 CrPC can be filed to claim alteration of the maintenance so awarded owing to change in circumstance. 
"Section 127 Cr.P.C. is not a stand-alone provision as the same requires a decision granting maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C. The term "change in circumstances" as referred to in Section 127(1) not only includes a change in the financial circumstances of the husband or wife but may also include other circumstantial changes in the husband's or wife's life which have arisen since the maintenance was first awarded," the Court said. 
The Court concluded that upon any consequent change in the circumstances or situation of the parties at the time of filing of application for alteration of the original order of maintenance, a petition under Section 127 of the Code has to be filed.
"The court must be satisfied that there has been a change in the circumstances of either the husband or of the wife, based upon which the fate of a petition under Section 127 Cr.P.C. shall be determined," it said.
The Court thus dismissed the plea observing that for seeking any further relief in case of change in circumstances, the petitioner wife had to take recourse to sec. 127 of Cr.P.C.
Case Title: SUNITA & ANR. v. VIJAY PAL @ MOHD. SABIR & ANR.

The Madras High Court has held that there is no bar under the Limitation Act on a plaintiff taking the plea of adverse possession in a suit for declaration of title and for the recovery of possession. Justice Teekaa Raman held that the age-old axiomatic of law that the plaintiff cannot raise the plea of adverse possession and that it can only be a defence of the defendant no longer holds the field.
 The court also relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in Ravinder Kaur Grewal and others v. Manjit Kaur and others (2019) where the Supreme Court observed as below:
 "Plea of acquisition of title by adverse possession can be taken by Plaintiff under Article 65 of the Limitation Act and there is no bar under the Limitation Act, 1963 to sue on aforesaid basis in the case of infringement of any rights of a Plaintiff."
 Facts
 In the present case, the appellant plaintiff had filed a suit for declaration of her title and for an injunction. During the pendency of the suit, she also filed an application for a temporary injunction. She claimed that the suit property originally belonged to one Chellaiah, the husband of the first respondent/defendant and the father of the remaining respondents. The said Chellaiah had sold the property in 1993 to Moolaiyan, the appellants father, through an unregistered sale deed. Later, Moolaiyan obtained patta transfer in his name. After Moolaiyan's death, the plaintiff became the owner of the suit property and she has paid kist to the Government.
 The defendant stated that the unregistered sale deed relied upon by the plaintiff was not true, not genuine, invalid, and inadmissible in law. It was further contended that even thoughthe plaintiff claims that by an unregistered sale deed, Chellaiah had sold the property to Moolaiyan in 1993, the said Moolaiyan had not obtained any patta in his favour till 2000. It was only after the death of Moolaiyan that the patta was obtained by manipulation.
The respondent also produced online patta print which was in favour of Chellaiah. An RTI reply received from the Zonal Deputy Tahsildar also shows that no record was available in the Tahsildar Office which may reveal the mutation of revenue records in the name of Moolaiyan, father of the plaintiff. This creates serious doubts with respect to the evidentiary value of the documents produced by the plaintiff. 
The respondent also contended that as a plaintiff, she cannot raise a plea of adverse possession and the plea of adverse possession can only be a defence of a defendant for declaration of title and it cannot be a plea of the plaintiff to sue as a suit for declaration of title on the plea of adverse possession. 
The court was not inclined to accept this contention of the defendant and held that the law does not bar the plaintiff from raising the plea of adverse possession. However, with respect to the relief of interim injunction, the court was satisfied with the submission of the defendant with respect to the evidentiary value of the documents produced by the plaintiff. 
The court stated that even assuming without admitting the plea of the plaintiff, the fact remained that till the date of death of Chellaiah, no document, evidencing the possession has been produced. The fact assumes great significance as there was no positive explanation as to why the transfer of patta was not effected for seven long years, till the date of death of the original assignee, Moolaiyan. 
The court was satisfied that the plaintiff had not made out any prima facie case of her alleged possession and the documents produced by the plaintiff also appeared to be under cloud. Therefore, the court opined that there was no illegality or irregularity in the order of the trial judge in not granting an interim injunction and thus there was no need for interference.

The Supreme Court observed that a lender who advanced interest free loans to finance the business operations of a corporate body is a Financial Creditor and competent to initiate the Corporate Resolution Process under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.
"There is no discernible reason, why a term loan to meet the financial requirements of a Corporate Debtor for its operation, which obviously has the commercial effect of borrowing, should be excluded from the purview of a financial debt", the bench comprising Justices Indira Banerjee and V. Ramasubramanian observed.
The court also held that Financial Debt' would include interest free loans advanced to finance the business operations of a corporate body, 
The question considered by the bench in the appeal against National Company Law Appellate Tribunal was whether a person who gives a term loan to a Corporate Person, free of interest, on account of its working capital requirements is not a Financial Creditor, and therefore, incompetent to initiate the Corporate Resolution Process under Section 7 of the IBC.
Sameer Sales Private Limited, "Original Lender", advanced a term loan of Rs.1.60 crores to the Corporate Debtor for a period of two years to meet its working capital requirement. He filed a Petition under Section 7 of the IBC in the NCLT for initiation of the Corporate Resolution Process. The petition was rejected by National Company Law Tribunal. The NCLAT upheld this order observing that the lender had extended interest free unsecured loan and therefore would not come under the definition of Financial Creditor. According to NCLAT, if the money borrowed is not against payment of interest, under the definition of financial debt, the core requirement is to find whether there is "consideration for the time value of money".
To hold that this interpretation is wrong, the bench referred to Section 5(8) defines 'financial debt' to mean "a debt along with interest if any which is disbursed against the consideration of the time value of money and includes money borrowed against the payment of interest. 
"22. The NCLT and NCLAT have overlooked the words "if any" which could not have been intended to be otiose. 'Financial debt' means outstanding principal due in respect of a loan and would also include interest thereon, if any interest were payable thereon. If there is no interest payable on the loan, only the outstanding principal would qualify as a financial debt. Both NCLAT and NCLT have failed to notice  clause(f) of Section 5(8), in terms whereof 'financial debt' includes any amount raised under any other transaction, having the commercial effect of borrowing.", the bench said.
The bench further observed that sub-clauses (a) to (i) of Sub-section 8 of Section 5 of the IBC are illustrative and not exhaustive. "The definition of 'financial debt' in Section 5(8) of the IBC cannot be read in isolation, without considering some other relevant definitions, particularly, the definition of 'claim' in Section 3(6), 'corporate debtor' in Section 3(8), 'creditor' in Section 3(10), 'debt' in section 3(11), 'default' in Section 3(12), 'financial creditor' in Section 5(7) as also the provisions, inter alia, of Sections 6 and 7 of the IBC.", the court added.
31. At the cost of repetition, it is reiterated that the trigger for initiation of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process by a Financial Creditor under Section 7 of the IBC is the occurrence of a default by the Corporate Debtor. 'Default' means non-payment of debt in whole or part when the debt has become due and payable and debt means a liability or obligation in respect of a claim which is due from any person and includes financial debt and operational debt. The definition of 'debt' is also expansive and the same includes inter alia financial debt. The definition of 'Financial Debt' in Section 5(8) of IBC does not expressly exclude an free loan. 'Financial Debt' would have to be construed to include interest free loans advanced to finance the business operations of a corporate body.", the bench said while allowing the appeal.
The judgment also refers to various principles of interpretation of statutes.
Interpretative effort "must be illumined by the goal, though guided by the words
In construing and/or interpreting any statutory provision, one must look into the legislative intent of the statute. The intention of the statute has to be found in the words used by the legislature itself. In case of doubt, it is always safe to look into the object and purpose of the statute or the reason and spirit behind it. Each word, phrase or sentence has to be construed in the light of the general purpose of the Act itself, as observed by Mukherjea, J. in Poppatlal Shah Vs. State of Madras, and a plethora of other judgments of this Court. To quote Krishna Iyer, J, the interpretative effort "must be illumined by the goal, though guided by the words"
Statute has to be read as a whole
When a question arises as to the meaning of a certain provision in a statute, the provision has to be read in its context. The statute has to be read as a whole. The previous state of the law, the general scope and ambit of the statute and the mischief that it was intended to remedy are relevant factors.
Expression 'includes'  is prima facie extensive
 Where the word is defined to include something, the definition is prima facie extensive.Of course, depending on the context in which the word 'includes' may have been used, and the objects and the scheme of the enactment as a whole, the expression 'includes' may have to be construed as restrictive and exhaustive.

Observing that repeated sexual activity on a 9 year old child is not possible without any injury in the vaginal /genital area, the Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently set aside the conviction order of the trial court passed against a rape accused.
Finding that the prosecutrix may have been tutored to make the statement for implicating the appellant falsely, the Bench of Justice M. A. Chowdhary set aside the conviction order passed against one Ishfaq Ahmad Khan by Additional Sessions Judge, Anantnag under Section 376(2)(i) RPC convicting the appellant/rape accused.
The case in brief 
Appellant had moved the High Court challenging his conviction under Section 376(2)(i) RPC on the ground that he had been falsely implicated in the case by the father of the prosecutrix for dispute over some payments between them.
It was further his case that the trial court had relied upon the statement of prosecutrix, though her statement did not inspire confidence to base conviction; that the prosecution had examined most of the witnesses from the family of the prosecutrix only, and their statements are of no corroboration with that of the statement of prosecutrix.
On the Other hand, it was the prosecutrix version that during the night hours, appellant/accused molested her younger sister, who told her about this incident and she shifted her younger sister towards other side and slept herself on the side of the appellant.
Thereafter, she alleged that the accused/appellant focused torch on her, took her to his bedding, gagged her mouth with a muffler and took off his and her lowers with the help of his legs and arms and then raped her.
Court's observations 
On consideration of whole of the gamut of the prosecution evidence, the Court observed that the case mainly revolved around the deposition of the prosecutrix who was only 9 years of age. 
Further, the Court noted that though accused could be held guilty for the commission of offence of rape based on the solitary evidence of the prosecutrix, however the same must inspire confidence and should appear to be absolutely trustworthy, unblemished and should be of sterling quality.
Now against this backdrop, when the Court analysed the deposition of the prosecutrix, it found that there was total variation in her version from what was stated in the complaint and what was deposed before the court at the time of trial. 
"It is not understandable as to how the prosecutrix, who was apprehensive with regard to her sister who was younger to her being molested who in her own statement had not said anything with regard to her alleged molestation, and instead of informing her younger sister about the incident the prosecutrix should have informed her maternal uncle or her brother who too were sleeping in the same room, and how without any protest she was shifted to the bedding of the appellant by the appellant and then after having sexual activity went back to her own bedding...It cannot be possible that the child of the age of only 9 years, who even had not reached the age of menarche could be ravished three times repeatedly without any pain, protest or resistance which may not have been noticed by the other persons sleeping in the same room", the Court noted as it found the desposition of the prosecutirx unbelievable.
The Court also osberved that the contention of the prosecutrix was belied to the extent that the statement of the medical expert who had clearly stated that there was no injury on the private parts of the prosecutrix. 
"The repeated sexual activity on such a person of tender age cannot be possible without any injury in the vaginal /genital area...it is clear that presence of almost all the witnesses- parents, maternal uncle and siblings- elder brother and younger sister, was in the house and except parents all others in the room, where the prosecutrix is alleged to have been raped by the appellant, conduct of the parents to sleep in the upper floor, leaving the children including prosecutrix in the ground floor, where the beddings of the daughters were claimed to have been laid just besides that of appellant who was a stranger, is not understandable," the Court remarked as it found the prosecutrix's statement to be not sterling, and thus, it allowed the appeal of the accused.
Case title - Ishfaq Ahmad Khan v. State of J&K & Ors. [CrlA(S) No. 8/2019-CrlM No. 914/2019]
Case citation:  (JKL) 62

The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently quashed a rape case against a man registered at the instance of his 'second wife' as the Court noted that it was a frivolous case and her version indicated false allegations against the man.
The Bench of Justice Anand Pathak observed that it was vexatious and frivolous litigation just to exert pressure on the man to extract money or an attempt made by the prosecutrix ('second wife') to convert domestic dispute into criminal allegations.
The Case in brief
Essentially, the 41-year-old respondent No.2/complainant/prosecutrix lodged an FIR against 55-year-old Manohar Silawat (Applicant/Petitioner) alleging that she was raped by him in the month of May 2001 and as a result whereof, she became pregnant and out of such relation, one child was born. 
It was further alleged that thereafter, he used to have physical relationship with her continuously and he used to call her for intermittent payments towards her maintenance amount and used to commit rape, and threatened her with dire consequences. 
On the other hand, challenging the FIR registered against himself and consequential criminal proceedings arising out of the case under Sections 376, 506 of IPC, the petitioner moved the instant Section 482 CrPC.
The Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the complainant and the petitioner, both belong to Scheduled Caste and as per their customs, between them, Natra (social customs like live-in/marriage) was performed in which, with the consent of his first wife, the petitioner lived with both of his wives.
It was his further case that when despite the instance of the prosecutrix, the petitioner did not part his whole property in favor of the prosecutrix, then these false allegations have been leveled against him.
The Counsel also referred to an application made by the complainant/alleged victim under Section 125 of Cr.P.C.before Principal Judge, Family Court, Gwalior seeking maintenance from the petitioner alleging that she is his wife and in July 2019, she was removed by him from his family household.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court noted that the prosecutrix had lived with the petitioner and in fact blessed with a boy namely Harsh (now almost 20 years old) and after 18 years, she had filed a complaint on which case has been registered against the petitioner.
Finding her case to be unbelievable, the Court further observed thus:
"When petitioner and prosecutrix lived together as a couple for 18 long years then after such lapse of time any allegation levelled by prosecutrix pales into oblivion because they are primarily motivated to exert pressure. Not only this, perusal of application under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. filed at the instance of respondent No.2 further reveals that on the one hand she levelled the allegations that they lived in live-in relationship but now she makes an application that they lived as married couple. Such divergent stand can only be availed of in case of misrepresentation of facts"
Consequently, the Court opined that It would be a miscarriage of justice if such false allegations are allowed to sustain and the petitioner is unnecessarily dragged into litigation to defend himself. Therefore, the Court quashed the FIR and entire criminal proceedings and allowed the petitioner's plea.

The Delhi High Court has held that to prosecute a person for an offence committed under Section Section 3(1)(w) of the SC/ST Act, the prosecution must show that the offence was committed in reference to the 'caste' of the victim/ prosecutrix.
Section 3(1)(w) penalizes a person, not being a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe intentionally touches a woman belonging to a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe, knowing that she belongs to a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe, when such act of touching is of a sexual nature and is without the recipient's consent.
"The Complainant does not allege in her complaint that she was sexually victimised by reason of her caste status throughout her relationship with the Petitioner/Applicant," the Court noted in the facts of the instant case. It thus allowed the anticipatory bail application filed by the accused.
Justice Chandra Dhari Singh observed,
"It appears that the offences in the nature of sexual assault, alleged to have been committed by the Petitioner/Applicant, had no reference to the prosecutrix‟s caste, thereby, Section 3(1)(w) of the SC/ST Act does not prima facie come into play in the instant case."
Similarly, it noted that the offences punishable under Sections 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s) of the SC/ST Act also do not prima facie attract because there is no allegation that the alleged casteist slur was made "within public view".
Also Read: Insulting Or Abusing SC-ST Person Within Four Walls Of A House Is Not An Offence Under SC-ST Act: Supreme Court
Section 3(1)(r) relates to intentionally insulting or intimidating with intent to humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in any place within public view. Section 3(1)(s) penalizes abusing any member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe by caste name in any place within public view.
In such circumstances, the Court added that the bar created by Sections 18 and 18A will not be applicable to the instant case. It observed,
"absence of the ingredients of Section 3(1)(w) of the SC/ST Act, or even for the offence under Sections 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s) of the SC/ST Act, the question of applicability of the Sections 18 or 18A(2) of the SC/ST Act getting triggered does not arise in the instant case."
 FIR alleging Sexual Offence
 An FIR was filed against the Bail Applicant for charges related to Sections 376/506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Sections 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s) of the SC/ST Act. The FIR was based on a Complaint by a divorced woman belonging to the Pasi Harijan Scheduled Caste category. It was alleged that the Petitioner made forceful physical relations, took objectionable pictures, extorted money, and threatened the Complainant with murder. Caste-based allegations were made based on an incident where the Applicant termed her as "Pasi".
 Applicability of SC/ST Act
 The Court assessed the evidence on the relationship between the parties. It was observed that the parties enjoyed a consensual relationship.
Finding no prima facie evidence for the applicability of SC/ST Act and following the Supreme Court case of Prithvi Raj Chauhan Vs Union of India and Others, 2020 SCC SC 159, the Court allowed the bail application on the following counts:
1. There was no caste-based sexual violence in the complaint's allegations throughout the relationship. An episode of the alleged caste-based slur was made only in the context of the Applicant refusing to marry the Complainant and not on sexual assault. It was noted that Section 3(1)(w) was not added in the original FIR but was added subsequently during court developments. Accordingly, Section 3(1)(w) of the SC/ST Act was held prima facie not applicable.
2. The alleged caste-based slur was not made in public view, as required in Sections 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s) of the SC/ST Act. The Complainant had admitted that she had no recollection of any public person being present at the time of the incident. Accordingly, Sections 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s) of the SC/ST Act was held not applicable to the Complainant's case.
3. Bar posed by Sections 18 and 18A(2) of the SC/ST Act against Section 438 CrPC was not attracted as no case was made out for an offence under the Act.
 In Prithvi Raj Chauhan, the Supreme Court held that the High Court has inherent powers to grant pre-arrest bail in appropriate cases. Further, the bar against Anticipatory Bail under Section 18 of the SC/ST Act be invoked only if a prima facie case is made out. It was held in the case that:
 "Concerning the applicability of provisions of section 438 Cr.PC, it shall not apply to the cases under the Act of 1989. However, if the complaint does not make out a prima facie case for applicability of the provisions of the Act of 1989, the bar created by section 18 and 18A (i) shall not apply."
 In light of the established jurisprudence, the Court allowed the anticipatory bail application with directions to the Complainant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with surety of like amount from a family member to the Investigating Officer and other conditions.
 Case Title: Joy Dev Nath v. State (NCT of Delhi)
 Case No: BAIL APPN. NO. 4511/2021
 Date of Judgment: 28.1.2022

Longer stint as Election Commissioner is necessary to ensure independence, said Court.In the judgment giving directions to reform the process of appointment of Election Commissioners, the Supreme Court has observed that the process of appointment of Arun Goel as an Election Commissioner "throws up certain pertinent questions".
The Constitution Bench had started hearing the petitions which sought an independent mechanism to appoint Election Commissioners on November 17, 2022. When the matter stood posted to November 22, 2022, the Centre notified the appointment of Goel as an EC on November 18, 2022 with respect to a vacancy which had been in existence since May 5, 2022. The judgment noted that an application filed by the petitioners to stop appointments to the vacancy during the pendency of the case was on record, though no order was passed on it.
Expressing surprise at the "lighting speed" with which the appointment of Goel had made, the Court had in November 2022 directed the Attorney General for India to produce the relevant files before reserving judgment. From the files, the Court noted that the Union of India was aware of the pendency of the matter.
Appointment process completed in one day
The Court also noted that the whole process regarding Goel's appointment was completed in one day. On November 18, 2022, approval was sought for filling up of the vacancy of EC. On the same day, a database of the IAS officers, serving and retired, was drawn up. Four names were considered. Goel was due to retired in December 2022 and had sought voluntary retirement. On the very same day, the Prime Minister recommended his name for appointment. On the same day again, Goel made an application seeking waiver of the 3-month period to avail voluntary retirement. "Not coming as a surprise, on the same day, his appointment as Election Commissioner was also notified", the judgment noted.
The judgment further stated, "We are a little mystified as to how the officer had applied for voluntary retirement on 18.11.2022, if he was not in the know about the proposal to appoint him".
"Since the Constitution Bench has been constituted to consider the need for a different method of appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and the Election Commissioners, the procedure involved in the appointment as has been followed throws up certain pertinent questions", the judgment authored by Justice KM Joseph stated.
Officers who could serve full 6 years must be preferred
In this backdrop, the Court highlighted that persons who could serve a term of full six years as Election Commissioners should be preferred. As per the relevant provision of law [Section 4(1) of the Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Conditions of Service) Act, 1991], the EC has to vacate the office on reaching 65 years of age.
“The philosophy behind giving a reasonably long stint to the appointee to the post of Election Commissioner or the Chief Election Commissioner, is that it would enable the Officer to have enough time to gear himself to the needs of the Office and to be able to assert his independence.”
A Constitution Bench comprising Justices KM Joseph, Ajay Rastogi, Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and CT Ravikumar noted that though there is a proviso to Section 4(1) of the Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Conditions of Service) Act, 1991 which grants relaxation to the six year term, it is only an exception and the proviso cannot arrogate itself to the status of the main provision. It observed - 
“The exception cannot become the Rule. Yet, this what the appointments have been reduced to. It undermines the independence of the Election Commission. The policy of the law is defeated.”
Justice Joseph pointed out that even among the 4 names that were shortlisted, the Government selected names of those who were to retire before the 6 year tenure. He indicated that the executive is required to pick names of those who could serve the full tenure, otherwise it would be a violation of Section 4 of the Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Conditions of Service) Act, 1991.
In the judgment authored by Justice Joseph, the Court noted that no law has been laid down as contemplated under Article 324 of the Constitution. However, there seems to exist a convention to appoint senior Members of the Civil Services, other serving or retired Officers of the rank of Secretary to the Government of India/Chief Secretary of State Government as the Election Commissioners. As per the same convention, the senior-most Election Commissioner is appointed as the Chief Election Commissioner. 
 As per Section 4 of the Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Conditions of Service) Act, 1991, the Chief Election Commissioner and the Election Commissioner is entitled to a term of 6 years, but they have to vacate the office upon attaining the age of 65 years. The Bench had enquired during the proceedings that in order to fulfil the mandate of the provision the Government could have considered an officer who could have completed the full term of six years. The Attorney General, R Venkatramani had submitted that there was dearth of such officers. Countering his submission, Advocate Prashant Bhushan and Senior Advocate Gopal Shankaranarayanan representing the petitioners had pointed out that there are 160 officers who belonged to the same Batch as Arun Goel, but were younger to him. Considering the same, the Bench observed -
“If the drawing up of the panel itself results in a fate accompli, then, the whole exercise would be reduced to a foregone conclusion as to who would be finally appointed. What we find about the method involved is, even proceeding on the basis that the Government has the right to confine the appointee to Civil Servants, that it is in clear breach of the contemplated mandate that be it as an Election Commissioner or Chief Election Commissioner, the appointee should have a period of six years. The philosophy behind giving a reasonably long stint to the appointee to the post of Election Commissioner or the Chief Election Commissioner, is that it would enable the Officer to have enough time to gear himself to the needs of the Office and to be able to assert his independence. An assured term would instil in the appointee, the inspiration and the will to put in place any reforms, changes, as also the inspiration to bring out his best. A short-lived stint may drain the much- needed desire besides the time to fulfil the sublime objects of the high Office of the Election Commissioner or the Chief Election Commissioner. Any tendency towards placating the powers that be, would wax as also the power and the will to assert his independence may wane, bearing in mind, the short tenure.”
The Bench further clarified that its observations are not meant to be an assessment of the suitability of Arun Goel. The bench noted that he had excellent academic qualifications. However, the academic excellence of the individuals being considered for appointment cannot replace the value of independence and freedom from bias of political affiliation, it added.
[Case Title: Anoop Baranwal v. Union of India WP(C) No. 104/2015]

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has reiterated that Courts must adopt a practical approach while dealing with matrimonial litigation, instead of approaching the case in a hyper-technical manner. This is because matrimonial disputes ultimately affect families and human relationships.
The remarks were made while setting aside a Family Court order which struck off wife's defence in a divorce case, without providing adequate opportunity. Justice Harkesh Manuja said,
 "In the matrimonial litigation, the dispute is primarily relating to the human relationship, which ultimately not only affects the two families but the society at large as well and thus, the standard of strict applicability of the procedure needs to be avoided and instead of adopting hyper-technical approach, the courts are required to be more practical while dealing with such kind of litigation."
 The petitioner-wife had appeared before the Family Court on 26.04.2022 and had sought time for filing of written statement to the divorce petition as well as to file reply to application for grant of interim custody of the minor child. On the next date, she sought further time for the purpose of filing written statement and reply to application, but the same could not be done and on the next date fixed thereafter, the Family Court ordered for striking off her defence.
 From a perusal of zimni orders, the High Court observed that the petitioner-wife was never afforded sufficient and adequate opportunity to file her written statement. "Non-granting of adequate and sufficient opportunity to petitioner-wife for the purpose of filing of her written statement would cause substantial prejudice to her rights, involving her matrimonial dispute, including the custody of the minor child," it said.
 Accordingly, the Court directed the Family Court to grant one "effective opportunity" to the petitioner to file her written statement as well as reply to the application for grant of interim custody of the minor child.
 Case Title: Simrit Gulani v. Anil Gulani 
 Coram: Justice Harkesh Manuja

The Allahabad High Court has observed that a Victim/Informant under Section 372 of CrPC can't prefer an appeal against an acquittal/lesser offence/inadequate compensation order passed before December 31, 2009 (the day on which a proviso was added to Section 372 CrPC).It may be noted that the proviso to Section 372 CrPC says that a victim/informant has a right to prefer an appeal against...
The Allahabad High Court has observed that a Victim/Informant under Section 372 of CrPC can't prefer an appeal against an acquittal/lesser offence/inadequate compensation order passed before December 31, 2009 (the day on which a proviso was added to Section 372 CrPC).
It may be noted that the proviso to Section 372 CrPC says that a victim/informant has a right to prefer an appeal against any order passed by the court acquitting the accused or convicting for a lesser offence or imposing inadequate compensation.
The Bench of Justice Vivek Kumar Birla and Justice Mohd. Aslam however clarified that such an appeal can be filed only if the order in question has been passed after the enforcement of the proviso to Section 372 CrPC.
The case in brief 
The Court was dealing with an appeal filed by the informant, after a delay of 5173 days, against the acquittal order dated January 11, 2002, passed by Additional Sessions Judge, Deoria in under Sections 147, 148, 302, 302/149 IPC. The appeal was filed along with a delay condonation application filed under Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
Justifying the delay, the counsel for the applicant submitted that the delay was for the reason that in the year 2002, the appellant was suffering from poor health and he could not approach his local counsel, and when he approached his counsel, then he got information that a State appeal would be filed by the State. 
Thereafter, the appellant went outside of the house for earning a livelihood and when he came to Allahabad in march, 2016 for his personal work, then he got the information that the State appeal was not filed, and therefore, it was prayed that the delay in filing an appeal be condoned.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court noted that the impugned judgment is of the year 2002 and therefore, a question was to be decided as to whether an appeal can be moved against an acquittal order which had been passed way before December 31, 2009, when the proviso to Section 372 came into force.
Taking into account the proviso to Section 372, the Court observed thus:
"The statutory right in favor of the victim was granted by way of amendment under Section 372 CrPC w.e.f. 31.12.2009 and prior to that amendment, in State case only the State Government could have filed the appeal that too along with an application for granting leave to appeal. The appellant at the time of passing of the impugned judgment could have at the most challenged the order by filing criminal revision which right was admittedly not exercised by the appellant."
Against this backdrop, the Court opined that there is no specific provision that proviso to Section 372 CrPC is retrospective in nature, and therefore, the Court added, the instant appeal would not be maintainable and accordingly, the same was dismissed as not maintainable.
The Court also averred that since there was no right available to the informant after the passing of the acquittal order to move an appeal against the same, therefore, the grounds narrated in the affidavit filed in support of delay condonation application under Section 5 of Limitation Act need not be looked into.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that the trial court has the power to allow the prosecution to produce the certificates under Section 65-B (4) of the Indian Evidence Act at a later point of time during the trial.
The Bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh observed thus as it upheld the order of the trial court allowing an application filed by the prosecution under section 311 CrPC to bring on record two certificates under section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 as they were not filed in property form during the filming of the charge sheet.
It may be noted that Section 65B(4) of the Indian Evidence Act requires the production of a certificate for leading secondary evidence of an electronic record. This provision aims to sanctify secondary evidence in electronic form, generated by a computer.
The case in brief
One Shyam Sunder Prasad (Accused/Revisionist) was serving as the Branch Manager of Punjab National Bank. Allegedly, he demanded a bribe of Rs. 80,000/- from the complainant for defreezing the account. A complaint was made by the complainant in this regard.
Now, during the verification of the complaint, on 25-04-2014, when the complainant met and requested the accused revisionist for reducing the bribe amount, he agreed to accept the bribe of Rs. 50,000/- by cheque. This conversation was recorded and transferred into a blank Compact Disc.
A trap was laid and the accused revisionist was caught red-handed with a tainted bribe cheque. The conversation between the accused revisionist and the complainant was recorded during the transaction of the bribe cheque and the same was transferred into a blank Compact Disc. 
The C.B.I. after investigation of the offence, filed a charge sheet for the offences punishable under sections 7 & 13(2) read with section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 against the accused revisionist in 2014. However, CBI did not file the certificate under section 65-B (4) in a proper format.
Now, in 2021 an application under Section 311 CrPC was filed to bring on record two certificates (in connection with Compact Discs containing the conversation b/w the complainant and the accused) under section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 as well as to recall the witnesses to prove those certificates.
The Court allowed the application, and therefore, aggrieved by the order, the accused/revisionist moved the HC with the instant revision plea challenging the order of the Special Judge, C.B.I. Court No. 6, Lucknow.
It was the contention of the accused that no reason was given for filing certificates belatedly inasmuch as the charge sheet was filed in the year 2014 itself, but, the certificates are of the years 2021. 
It was primarily argued that when the certificates are being issued by the C.B.I. Officers themselves, at this belated stage, accepting the certificates and allowing the application to recall the witnesses would be highly prejudicial to the trial of the accused.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court 
relied upon the ruling of Arjun Pandit Rao Khotkar Vs. Kailash Kushanrao Gorantyal and others (2020) 7 SCC 1
, wherein it was held by the Apex Court that Section 65-B (4) of the Act does not
 mention the stage of furnishing the certificate.In view of this, the High Court observed thus:
"...for admissibility of an electronic record/document, section 65-B(4) is mandatory for recording it in evidence. When the electronic record is produced in evidence without proper certificate, trial court must summon the person/persons referred in Section 65-B (4) of the Indian Evidence Act, and require that such certificate be given by such person/persons...in appropriate cases, the trial court depending on the facts and circumstances of the case may exercise its discretion under section 91 or section 311 Cr.P.C. or Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act as the case may be and can allow the prosecution to produce the certificates under section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act at later point of time and same would also be the case in respect of an accused who desires to produce the requisite certificates as part of his defence."
Now, in view of the facts of the case, the Court observed that the two Compact Discs have already been supplied to the accused-revisionist and only certificates under section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act have been allowed to be produced to prove and by allowing the application under section 311 Cr.P.C..
The Court further added that by allowing the application, the accused-revisionist was not prejudiced in any manner by producing the certificates in respect of the electronic evidence and therefore, the Court dismissed the instant revision plea.
Case title - Shyam Sunder Prasad v. Central Bureau Of Investigation Lucknow [CRIMINAL REVISION No. - 588 of 2022]

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently acquitted a school teacher charged and sentenced under the POCSO Act, stating that it is highly improbable that a minor girl who has been sexually abused by her teacher on more than one occasion would not disclose this factum either to her parents or her teacher or any of her class fellows.The bench comprising Justices G.S.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently acquitted a school teacher charged and sentenced under the POCSO Act, stating that it is highly improbable that a minor girl who has been sexually abused by her teacher on more than one occasion would not disclose this factum either to her parents or her teacher or any of her class fellows.
The bench comprising Justices G.S. Sandhawalia and Vikas Suri further added that the delay in lodging of the FIR has wiped out all the evidence and though conviction can be based solely on victim's testimony, the same must meet the threshold of inspiring court's confidence. 
"It is settled principle that though the victim's statement could be the sole basis of conviction but if there is some doubt then corroboration is required and if the statement is not of sterling quality which in the present case does not inspire that much of confidence as it should have."
The court in the instant case was dealing with an appeal by a teacher convicted for alleged sexual exploitation of minor student. Being aggrieved by the order of his conviction Section 376(2)(f)(i) and Section 6 of the POCSO Act and 14 years of rigorous imprisonment, the appellant preferred the instant appeal.
 Issue for consideration before the High Court was whether the sole testimony of the minor would be sufficient to implicate the appellant in the instant case for which there is a delay of 6 months in lodging of the FIR.
 The court noted that the testimony of the victim is not to be discarded and should be appreciated keeping in mind the principles of probabilities. However, the consequences of false allegations of rape should also be kept in mind. Therefore, it becomes pertinent to carefully examine whether the story set out by the prosecution at the instance of the victim and her parents, and whether it is improbable and belies logic or not.
"One cannot lose sight of the fact that false allegations of rape can cause extreme distress and humiliation to the accused apart from the consequences of such a conviction which in the present case would be of dismissal from service. Therefore, one has to further carefully examine whether the story set out of the prosecution at the instance of the victim and her parents is improbable and belies logic or not."
For this reason, the court noted that the discussion as to how and in what manner the whole incident has unfolded has to be considered, more so in the present case where there has been a delay of 6 months in lodging of the FIR and no specific instance has been given regarding date and time of the incident.
 Regarding delay in lodging of the FIR, the court noted that the same is acceptable on account of protection of family prestige but the said delay factor is also to be examined on account of the medical evidence that would have totally diminished by then and the Courts are left grappling with only the ocular version of the parties. 
 It is in such circumstances the Courts have heavily led to granting the benefit of doubt if the victim's testimony does not stand the test of judicial scrutiny.
 After considering the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the court noted that there is an unexplained delay of 6 months regarding the incident for which no plausible explanation has been given. Moreover, court noted that delay in the FIR has led to the absence of medical evidence to connect the appellant with the crime beyond a shadow of doubt.
It also noted that the alleged incident was not a case of solitary abuse on a particular day when she had been called and rather it was her case that it happened on 2-3 occasions when she was called to the house where she had voluntarily gone and returned on an auto. The factum of being disturbed by such incident apparently never showed up at any point of time which is highly strange, court remarked.
 Regarding the age of the victim, the court noted that the Trial Court was not justified placing reliance upon the Secondary Examination Certificate as there was no official record of the State to prove her age and even the board of Doctors opined that her age could be between 16-18 years and the principles which have to be kept in mind is that there can be a great variation on the basis of which presumption under Section 29 of the POCSO Act could be raised against the appellant.
 For the reasons stated above, the present appeal was allowed.
Case Title: Avnish Kumar Sharma @ Avinish Versus State of Haryana

The Supreme Court on Monday issued contempt notice to the office bearers of the Bar Association of the Rajasthan High Court at Jaipur for boycotting a bench of the High Court as part of strike.A bench comprising Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna noted that despite repeated judgments of the Supreme Court which prohibit court boycotts and deprecated lawyers strikes, the Jaipur HC Bar Association...
The Supreme Court on Monday issued contempt notice to the office bearers of the Bar Association of the Rajasthan High Court at Jaipur for boycotting a bench of the High Court as part of strike.
A bench comprising Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna noted that despite repeated judgments of the Supreme Court which prohibit court boycotts and deprecated lawyers strikes, the Jaipur HC Bar Association went on a strike on September 27.
Senior Advocate Manan Kumar Mishra, the Chairman of the Bar Council of India, informed the bench that the BCI has issued a notice to the Jaipur Bar Association over the boycott and that they have replied stating that the boycott was only with respect to only one court of the High Court.
The Supreme Court sternly said that even the boycott of only one court room cannot be tolerated.
"Even that also cannot be tolerated. To boycott only one court will hamper the independence of judiciary and there may be a pressure on the particular judge whose court is boycotted and it may lead to demoralize the judiciary", the Supreme Court stated in the order.
"Issue notice upon the President, Secretary and the Office Bearers of the Bar Association of High Court of Rajasthan at Jaipur to show cause why contempt  proceedings may not be initiated against them", the order stated.
The notices, which are directed to be served on the respondents through the Registrar General of the High Court, are returnable on October 25.
"To go on strike by the Bar Association and the lawyers is absolutely contemptuous and just contrary to the earlier decisions of this Court in the case of Ex-Capt. Harish Uppal vs. Union of India, (2003) 2 SCC 45; Common Cause, A Registered Society vs. Union of India, (2006) 9 SCC 295; Krishnakant Tamrakar vs.State of M.P., (2018) 17 SCC 27 and District Bar Association,Dehradun through its Secretary vs Ishwar Shandilya & Ors., 2020 SCC Online SC 24", the order noted.
The issue relates to the Jaipur Bar Association's boycott of the court of Justice Satish Kumar Sharma. The resolution for the boycott was passed after the judge reportedly refused to give an urgent listing to a petition seeking protection for a lawyer. The association demanded that the roster be changed to remove criminal matters from the bench of Justice Sharma.
Supreme Court's contempt notice 
The Supreme Court issued the show-cause notice for contempt to the Jaipur Bar Association in the case District Bar Association,Dehradun through its Secretary vs Ishwar Shandilya & Ors, in which it has taken suo motu cognizance of the trend of lawyers strikes. The bench had earlier sought the assistance of the Bar Council of India to address the issue.
The Bar Council of India later told the bench that after a meeting with the State Bar Councils, it is proposing to frame rules to curtail strikes by lawyers and court boycotts and to take action against bar associations who act in breach and against advocates who promote such strikes through social media. 
On a subsequent hearing date, the bench said that it will pass a "detailed order" to deal with this issue. The bench also observed that it is considering setting up grievance redressal mechanism at local levels for lawyers so that their legitimate grievances can be addressed through a proper platform instead of resorting to strikes.
On February 28, 2020, the Supreme Court, taking a serious note of the fact that despite consistent decisions of the Court, the lawyers/Bar Associations go on strikes, had taken suo moto cognisance  and issued notices to the Bar Council of India and all the State Bar Councils to suggest the further course of action and to give concrete suggestions to deal with the problem of strikes/abstaining the work by the lawyers.
 The suo motu action of the Court came while dismissing an appeal filed by the District Bar Association Dehradun against a judgment of the Uttarakhand High Court which declared the lawyers strikes illegal. 

The Allahabad High Court has held that the taxing authorities cannot, in the garb of technicality, stop any assessee from claiming his statutory right, as provided under the Income Tax Act.
The bench of Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal has observed that, due to the mistake of the department or a technical glitch in the software, when an appeal of an assessee is not reflected on the portal, the department cannot deny the appeal filed offline on technical grounds.
The appellant/assessee is a registered public charitable trust constructing a charitable hospital, and certain exemptions were claimed by the assessee but not granted by the assessment order. After the passing of the order, the assessee reversed certain input tax credits through Form GSTR-3B. The department passed a summary order. The assessee, in the meantime, had tried to file an appeal online against the original order, which was not accepted, and the web portal displayed an error.
The assessee also preferred to file an appeal online against the summary order. The portal of the department reflected that the order number entered is already under appeal or that the appeal order has been passed. If the error persists, please call the GST help desk or log your issues on the Grievance Redressal Portal for GST and quote the error number.
The assessee moved a letter before the authority, making a complaint that the portal was not accepting the appeal against the order passed by the department. A rectification order under Section 161 was passed by the authorities, pursuant to which the recovery proceeding was initiated against the assessee on April 21, 2012. The Additional Commissioner had required the assessee to submit the acknowledgment of appeal filed online.
The petitioner submitted that the online portal of the department was not accepting the appeal filed by the assessee against the original order, and the department was insisting on placing the acknowledgment of the appeal filed online and not accepting the appeal filed offline.
Section 107 of the CGST Act, 2008, provides for the filing of an appeal against the order passed under the Act.
According to the petitioner, Rule 108 provides for the procedure and appeal to the Appellate Authority, which is to be filed in Form GST APL-01 along with relevant documents, either electronically or otherwise, as may be notified by the Commissioner. The Commissioner has not yet informed us of any other means by which an appeal could be filed.
The department contended that the assessee's appeal against the summary order was maintainable and that the assessee had failed to submit the acknowledgement slip to the Appellate Authority, resulting in the appeal not being heard and decided.As per the circular dated August 11, 2022, the problem of technical glitches in the filing of appeals was discussed by the Commissioner, and a direction was issued to all the appellate authorities throughout the state to get the matter resolved through the IT Cell and entertain the appeal online.
"There is absolute clarity by the legislature as to the notification that has to be published by the state government in the official gazette. Once no such notification has been issued, it would be presumed that another mode of filing the appeal would be offline," the court noted.
The court ordered the Additional Commissioner to hear the assessee's appeal, which was filed offline strictly in accordance with the law, within one month.
Case Title: M/S Yash Kothari Public Charitable Trust Versus State Of U.P. And 2 Others [WRIT TAX No. - 1027 of 2022]
Date: 16.1.2023
Counsel For Petitioner: Nishant Mishra
Counsel For Respondent: C.S.C.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently observed that Section 482 of CrPC confers extraordinary powers on High Court and empowers it to entertain applications not contemplated in the Code of Criminal Procedure, in case the ends of justice require.
"This section gives the power to this Court to entertain applications which are not contemplated in the Code of Criminal Procedure, in the event, it is felt that the ends of justice will require that the Court can invoke the extraordinary powers which are to be exercised with restraint and not lightly.
The bench comprising Justice Vivek Puri further held that when the Court is satisfied that its interference under inherent powers is required to meet the ends of justice, it ought to exercise such powers.
 The Court further added that inherent power vested under Section 482 should not be invoked as a matter of routine and it should only be invoked to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court and to secure the ends of justice.
The remarks were made while dealing with a petition filed under Section 482 CrPC, invoking the High Court's inherent jurisdiction for quashing of a FIR lodged under Sections 354-A (Sexual harassment) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and Section 8 (Sexual assault) of the POCSO Act,
 Considering the facts of the instant case where the victim-respondent no.2 who was aged about 17 years and 10 months at the time of occurrence and is now married to the petitioner after attaining the age of majority and the couple is stated to be residing happily with each other, the court opined that continuing criminal proceedings will cause injustice.
 In such circumstances, the possibility of conviction also become remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case will cause injustice not only to the petitioner but also to respondent No.2, who is now legally wedded wife of the petitioner. 
 Therefore, the court concluded that it is a fit case for exercising the inherent jurisdiction of this Court under Section 482 of the Code, so as to secure the ends of justice in the light of an amicable settlement having been effected between the parties and continuation of the prosecution would result in sheer abuse of process of law.
 In the light of the observations made above and considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the court ordered the FIR and all the consequential proceedings arising therefrom to be quashed.
 Case Title: Amit v. State of Haryana and Others

The Allahabad High Court has directed the Uttar Pradesh Government to give a promotion to a Police Inspector posted in the Civil Police to the post of a Deputy Superintendent of Police. 
With this, the bench of Justice Neeraj Tiwari set aside the order of the Additional Chief Secretary Home by which the name of the petitioner was kept in a sealed cover envelop and juniors to him were granted promotion
The case in brief
Essentially, the petitioner was appointed to the post of Sub-Inspector in the Civil Police Department in the year 1990, and a charge sheet was submitted against him in the year 1999.
 Thereafter, he was promoted to the post of Inspector in the year 2006, and the first DPC for promotion to the post of Deputy Superintendent of Police was also held on 01.01.2018, in which the name of the petitioner was considered, but due to the pendency of the criminal proceeding against him, his name was kept in a sealed cover envelop and juniors to him have been granted promotion. 
However, as per comments of ADGP, Administration dated 20.08.2020, several excellent entries were given to the petitioner in the last ten years of his service coupled with the fact that no punishment, either minor or major was awarded to the petitioner and after promotion, he has never misused his post in any way. 
Thus, he moved to the Court seeking a direction to the authorities to open the Seal Cover Envelop and promote the petitioner to the post of Dy.S.P. with all consequential benefits.
Court's observations
At the outset, the Court noted that even after the initiation of a criminal proceeding, the petitioner was granted promotion to the post of Inspector in 2006 upon which he is still working without any misuse of the post. 
Further, the Court noted that the petitioner was granted excellent entries for the last 10 years, and thus, the Court observed that the mere pendency of a criminal case coupled with the fact that the petitioner has been permitted to continue in service and also granted promotion, cannot be a ground for denying promotion.
Consequently, the Court noted that additional facts may be taken into consideration i.e. subsequent service record of the petitioner while opening the sealed cover envelop and in case the subsequent service record of petitioner is found excellent, unblemished, without any punishment, the same should be an additional ground to grant him promotion.
 Therefore, under such facts and circumstances, the writ petition was allowed and the UP government was directed to take necessary action to open the sealed cover envelop and grant promotion to the petitioner maximum within six weeks with all consequential benefits.
Case title - Umesh Pratap Singh v. State Of U.P. And 5 Others [WRIT - A No. - 7917 of 2022]

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that when dealing with a case registered under the provisions of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, the power to grant regular bail under Section 439 CrPC is subject to the conditions laid down in Section 37 of the NDPS Act. Power to grant bail under Section 439 of the Code is subject to the conditions laid down in Section 37...
The Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that when dealing with a case registered under the provisions of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, the power to grant regular bail under Section 439 CrPC is subject to the conditions laid down in Section 37 of the NDPS Act.
 Power to grant bail under Section 439 of the Code is subject to the conditions laid down in Section 37 of the NDPS Act, which commences with non-obstante clause.
 Section 37 of NDPS Act stipulates that every offence punishable under the Act shall be cognizable and no person accused of offences involving commercial quantity shall be released on bail or on his own bond unless (i) the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose the application for such release, and (ii) where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.
The bench comprising Justice Suvir Sehgal further added that the Court needs to see whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offence has not been committed by the accused and whether he is likely to commit any offence while he will be on bail. 
 The accused herein was arrested following recovery of 35,000 tablets of intoxicating substance from the vehicle being driven by him.
Besides urging that the petitioner has been falsely implicated in the FIR, counsel for the petitioner has argued that there is violation in compliance of Sections 42 and 50 of the NDPS Act. By referring to the recovery memo, counsel submitted that it carries the details of the FIR, which shows that the entire search is tainted. It has also been contended that the patrolling party was travelling in a private vehicle and there is an infraction of the instructions issued by the Govt.
The State on the other hand argued that as the contraband falls within the category of commercial quantity, the petitioner cannot be enlarged on bail in view of the bar under Section 37 of the NDPS Act.
After placing reliance on the judgement of the Supreme Court in the case of Union of India through NCB, Lucknow Vs. Md. Nawaz Khan (2021) 10 SCC 100, the court held that the arguments of the counsel for the petitioner regarding non-compliance of the procedure and instructions will be a subject matter of trial.
 Insofar as allegations against the petitioner are concerned, the court held that no explanation has been provided by the petitioner for the commercial quantity of contraband that has been recovered from his possession. Therefore, bar which is laid down under Section 37 of the NDPS Act is attracted in the instant case.
 As far as the power to grant bail under Section 439 CrPC is concerned, the court observed that this power is subject to the conditions laid down in Section 37 of the NDPS Act, which commences with a non-obstante clause.
 Admittedly, the co-accused were arraigned based on confessional statement of the petitioner along with the confessional statement of co-accused, Balwant. Further, no recovery was effected from them. Therefore, the orders passed by the Court in co-accused's case will not advance petitioner's case. 
 Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the huge quantity of contraband recovered from the petitioner, stringent provision of Section 37 and presumption under Section 54 of the NDPS Act as well as the fact that the trial is progressing, the court did not deem it fit to grant regular bail to the petitioner.
 Consequently, the court dismissed the instant petition.
Case Title: Harjeet Lal @ Laddu Vs. State of Punjab

In a significant judgment, the single bench of Rajasthan High Court held that the married daughter of a deceased employee falls within the definition of 'dependents' for compassionate appointment. "The perception of the daughter, after marriage no longer being a part of her father's household and becoming an exclusive part of her husband's household, is an outdated view...
In a significant judgment, the single bench of Rajasthan High Court held that the married daughter of a deceased employee falls within the definition of 'dependents' for compassionate appointment.
  "The perception of the daughter, after marriage no longer being a part of her father's household and becoming an exclusive part of her husband's household, is an outdated view and mindset."Justice Dr. Pushpendra Singh Bhati, observed.
 The court observed that any discrimination between unmarried & married daughter and married son & married daughter would be in clear violation of Article 14 ,15 and 16 of the Constitution.
 The court observed that in RBF Rig Corpn. v. Commr. of Customs (Imports) (2011) 3 SCC 573, State of A.P. v. Golconda Linga Swamy (2004) 6 SCC 522 and L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India), it was held that in an appropriate case the writ court retains the power as inherent in its constitution to do the right and undo a wrong in course of administration of justice on the principle of quando lex aliquid alicui concedit, concedere videtur id sine quo res ipsa esse non potest i.e. when the law gives a person anything, it gives him that without which it cannot exist.
 In the present matter, the father of the petitioner, who was working as Lineman in the Jodhpur Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Limited, died while in service on 05.11.2016 leaving behind his wife Smt. Shanti Devi and daughter-petitioner. Deceased's wife was having health issues and thus, the petitioner, who is his married daughter, applied for compassionate appointment, which was initially processed, but subsequently rejected.
 In this regard, the concerned authority held that as per Jodhpur Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Limited Compassionate Appointment of Dependents of Deceased Nigam Servants Regulation, 2016 (hereinafter to referred as 'Rules of 2016'), a married daughter of deceased employee would not fall within the category of the 'dependents'. The petitioner has challenges the aforesaid decision of the authority in this petition.
 The court finds that the right to be included in the coparcenary of father and the equal responsibility of maintenance of parents in old age as that of a son, regardless of marital status; places equal responsibilities on married daughter and married son. The court opined that no reason as to why a distinction must be made on the same ground, when it comes to compassionate appointment of married daughters.
 The court also observed that the pre-marriage status of a daughter, of being single/unmarried and post marriage status of a daughter either divorced, widowed or single again, renders her capable of seeking compassionate appointment. Only the exclusion of a daughter, during the period of marriage, for seeking compassionate appointment is arbitrary and unjust, added the court.
 Furthermore, the court opined that discrimination between a married son and a married daughter, with regard to appointment on the ground of compassionate appointment is not a reasonable classification and amounts to a treatment of equal persons in the eyes of law as unequal, which grossly violates Article 14. It adds that the aforesaid discrimination is not only violative of Article 15(3), but goes against the interest of women. In furtherance, court observes Article 16 prohibits discrimination on grounds of sex among citizens, particularly in the matters of public employment.
 Moreover, the court finds that the Apex Court in C.N. Apporva Shree, while analyzing the judgment has gave full imprimatur to the reasoning of the Karnataka High Court in Smt. Bhuvaneshwari V. Puranik and thus, it is clear that the rule within expression of family/dependent has to include unmarried daughter at par with married daughter and married daughter at par with married son.
 The court opined that the larger ramification of a law being struck down by the Courts is that it stands nullified in its stream of parallel legislation. It adds that even if any analogous law or legislation having the same meaning is not directly mentioned, then also, if it is absolutely on the same terms, as that of the law having been struck down by the Apex Court, then such legislation will fall within the same purview.
 The court further observed that it is not necessary that all legal parameters on the same wavelength need to be mentioned while striking down a legislation. The court further adds that what is to be seen is that the words and the exact spirit, if same, the verdict of the Apex Court is bound to have an impact of completely governing the field in question.
 In addition to this, the court observed that an analogous rule existed in the Rules of 1996 before the amendment made by the Legislature of the State of Rajasthan on 28 Oct, 2021. The court adds that it finds that there is no requirement to strike down the said provision of law, however, it also does not find any reason to deprive the petitioner of her right, especially in light of C.N. Apporva Shree and the subsequent amendment brought by the State Legislature.
 In furtherance, the court observed that the welfare legislation, in the considered opinion of the State has, after recent amendment to the Rules of 1996, now includes "married daughter" in the definition of dependent in the Rules of 1996, and to give a full colour to the welfare legislation, it needs to be implemented on all pending issues, which have not attained finality. It further observed that this matter of.present case comes within the perspective of pending issue and has been sub-judice since 2017.
 Taking into account that the Rules of 1996 are a welfare legislation, and the resounding mandate of Apex Court declaring the law treating a married daughter, as a disqualified person, as a trite law, the court is not declined to accept the proposition of the learned counsel for the respondent seeking rejection of the claim of compassionate appointment of the petitioner.
 The counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner is entitled to be given the compassionate appointment., as per Clause (iv) of Rule 2(c) and as per the clear interpretation of the Rules of 1996, which states that 'dependant' includes married daughter, if no other dependent of the deceased Government servant is available.
 On the other hand, the counsel for the respondents relied upon the order of this Court in the case of Nakul Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors. in D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.15912/2021, decided on 26.11.2021 wherein the court held that if the rule making authority at the relevant time provided within the purview of the definition of dependent a smaller class of members of the family of the deceased Government servant and excluded his/her brothers or sisters, the same per se so cannot be said to be discriminatory.
 Adv. Trilok Joshi appeared on behalf of petitioner, whereas AAG Pankaj Sharma, Adv. Kuldeep Mathur assisted with Adv. DS Sodha appeared on behalf of respondents.
Case Title: Shobha Devi v. Jodhpur Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Limited and Anr.

The Calcutta High Court on Friday ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate the murder of local All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Bhadu Sheikh that was followed by arson in Bogtui village, Rampurhat, Birbhum, that killed eight people, including two children.The Court had earlier transferred to the CBI the investigation into the incident of violence in...
The Calcutta High Court on Friday ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate the murder of local All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Bhadu Sheikh that was followed by arson in Bogtui village, Rampurhat, Birbhum, that killed eight people, including two children.
The Court had earlier transferred to the CBI the investigation into the incident of violence in Birbhum district of West Bengal that had allegedly taken place in retaliation to the murder of Sheikh.
The Court on Thursday had  reserved its order in a batch of pleas seeking a CBI probe into the murder of TMC leader Bhadu Sheikh. 
A Bench comprising Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj on Thursday had taken on record the preliminary report submitted by the CBI as per the Court's earlier directions. 
Pursuant to the perusal of the report, the Court observed that the report prima facie suggests that the brutal incident of burning and killing at Bogtui village is the direct fall out of the murder of Bhadu Sheikh at 8.30 P.M. on the same day. It was further noted that the CBI report suggests that the incident is the outcome political rivalry amongst members of two groups in the village and that the burning of houses resulting in the death of 8 persons was a retaliatory plan.
A host of applications had been moved before the Bench on Thursday seeking for a CBI probe into the murder of local TMC leader Bhadu Sheikh. The concerned counsels had alleged that the unfortunate incident of setting 10 houses on fire is not an isolated incident rather it is a counter-blast of the murder of Sheikh. 
Opining that there is a 'close relationship and linkage' between the two incidents, the Court observed, 
"Both the incidents took place within a gap of about 2 hours. Material placed on record prima facie suggests close relationship and linkage between the two incidents. The incidents are alleged to be result of political rivalry. The allegation of the applicants that both incidents form part of the common conspiracy and continuous cause of action cannot be ignored."
The Bench further opined that if one agency investigates both the incidents then not only it will be easier to unearth the truth but it will also facilitate the trial before the same competent Court.
Ordering a CBI probe into the murder, the Court underscored, 
"The object of issuing the necessary direction in the suo motu petition is to ensure appropriate action against the person responsible for the incident. On the basis of the material which is available before us, we are of the opinion that the said object can be more appropriately achieved if the incident of murder of Bhadu Sk is also investigated by the CBI along with the incident of burning of houses and murder of villagers of Bogtui which took place shortly thereafter. The second incident prima facie seems to be the fall out of first incident"
Accordingly, the Court directed the State police authorities to immediately hand over the investigation in the case of murder of Sheikh to the CBI along with all the records pertaining to the investigation conducted till date. 
"The CBI is directed to investigate the murder case of Bhadu Sk along with the investigation in the case of Bogtui house burning and murder case", the Court ordered further. 
The CBI was ordered to submit a further status report pertaining to both the investigations on the next date of hearing which is slated to take place on May 2. 
Additional Solicitor General Y.J Dastoor appearing for the CBI had submitted that the CBI is willing to investigate the murder of Bhadu Sheikh but he however expressed concerns that vital evidence may have been destroyed by now due to such a delayed plea for a CBI probe. He however had however contended that it is better if the investigation is done in both the cases by the same agency as both the incidents are interlinked and that it would facilitate trial of the cases before the same Judge.
Advocate General S.N Mookherjee appearing for the State government had however, argued that the police were investigating the matter. Three out of the four petitions also did not seek an inquiry by the central agency, the State had submitted. He had further argued that that there is no allegation that the probe into the murder of Sheikh was not being conducted properly. 
It may be noted the Court had earlier observed that although the SIT had been constituted on March 22, there had been no effective contribution of the SIT in the investigation. The Court had noted that despite the fact that the police station was situated very close to the place of occurrence, the police had not reached the crime scene on time as a result of which the persons trapped inside the houses were kept on burning. 
The State constituted Special Investigating Team (SIT) had also been ordered to not carry out any further investigation into the incident of violence.  The Court had earlier initiated a suo motu case to consider the issue.
Background
The violence in Birbhum's Bogtui village took place following the alleged murder of Bhadu Sheikh, a panchayat leader of the ruling Trinamool Congress. He died after miscreants allegedly hurled bombs at him on March 21.
Hours later, violence erupted and several houses, including two belonging to the men accused of Sheikh's murder, were allegedly attacked and set on fire resulting in eight deaths, including that of women and children.
The police recovered eight charred bodies, primarily of women and children from the gutted houses in Bogtui village. Three victims were admitted to the local hospital. The death toll currently stands at nine.
Taking cognisance of the violence, the State government had formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by the additional director general of police (CID), Gyanwant Singh, to probe the incident. However, subsequently, the investigation was handed over to the CBI pursuant to the directions of the Calcutta High Court.
As part of its investigation, the CBI has reportedly moved a local court on Wednesday to seek permission for conducting polygraph tests on eight people arrested in the case, including TMC leader Anarul Hossain.
According to reports, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday gave government jobs to 10 people who were affected in the Birbhum violence.
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has also taken suo motu cognizance of the matter and issued notices to the Chief Secretary and the Director General of Police, West Bengal calling for a detailed report in the matter within 4 weeks including the status for the FIRs registered in the matter, steps taken to ensure safety of the people in the village and any relief or rehabilitation provided by the State Government.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has dismissed a petition filed by social activist Prof. SK Bhalla seeking transfer of a defamation complaint, filed against him by a journalist in Doda, to Jammu.
The bench of Justice M A Chowdhary said that an accused cannot be allowed to have a place of his choice to be prosecuted by taking refuge of unfounded personal security apprehensions.
Bhalla claimed that the respondent was irked by his social media post about "Two Fake RTI Activists of Doda" which allegedly uncovered respondent's "evil misdemeanors". This led to the criminal defamation complaint and summons were issued to him.
In order to make out a case for transfer, Bhalla submitted that his security and safety are a concern as he apprehends danger to his life because of litigation voiced against the land and liquor mafias, land encroachers, politicians as well as other corrupt bureaucrats who are involved in those cases/PILs. 
Contesting the plea the respondent submitted that Bhalla had appeared before the trial Court on 15.04.2022 and had executed an undertaking to appear on each and every date of hearing. It also submitted that it will be inconvenient to the respondent to prosecute his case at Jammu since all his witnesses hail from Doda.
The High Court noted Section 407(1)(c)(ii) of CrPC which provides that any particular case or appeal can be transferred from a Criminal Court subordinate to its authority to any other such Criminal Court of equal or superior jurisdiction when it is expedient for the ends of justice and general convenience of the parties or witnesses. However, no occasion was made out to exercise this power as the alleged threat perception was not evaluated by any security agency.
It was a mere apprehension and Bhalla had not even complained to any authority to seek security, the Court noted.
The Court further pointed to the convenience of parties, stating that Bhalla would only travel from Jammu to Doda as an individual, whereas the complainant and his witnesses who are all based in Doda will have to face more difficulty, physically as well as financially, to prosecute the complaint at Jammu. 
"The petitioner/accused, in the considered opinion of this court, cannot be allowed to have a place of his choice to be prosecuted in a case of defamation, taking refuge of unfounded personal security", the bench added. 
Accordingly the bench found the petition without any merit and dismissed the same.

The Supreme Court on Friday granted Three weeks protection from arrest to Arnab Goswami, Editor-in-Chief of the Republic TV, on the basis of the FIRs filed against him in States of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Jammu & Kashmir.
A bench comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said ' no coercive actions to be taken against him for two weeks.
"Court intends to protect the petitioner for a period of Three weeks form today and permit him to move anticipatory bail application before the trial court or high court. For a period of two weeks, the petitioner shall be protected against any coercive steps in relation to the FIRs arising out of the telecast which took place on April 21" 
"Save and except for FIR registered at Nagpur, (FIR number 238 of 2020 dated April 22, 2020 registered at Nagpur, further proceedings arising out of and relating to FIRs and complaints listed out petition shall remain stayed until further orders."
The Bench also held that if there is any other FIRs filed thereafter, (arising out of or related to present cause of action) shall also remain stayed till further orders. 
The Bench has directed the Commissioner of Police , Mumbai to give protection to Republic TV Office and the Petitioner
'The Petitioner must cooperate with investigation', said the Bench
Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi appeared for Arnab Goswami.
Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi begins:"There is a place called #Palghar in Maharashtra, where persons were lynched in the presence of 12 police personnel...my client (#ArnavGoswami) bought out this incident on his daily show for 45 Minutes...."#PalgharMobLynching— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) April 24, 2020
Rohatgi submitted that the individual complainants could not be impleaded as his client had to file the petition in one day after the "murderous attack" on him and his wife on April 23.
"I have impleaded the States. I can implead the complaints also. Could not do, so since I had to file in one day because of the murderous attack on my client and his wife."Rohatgi for #ArnabGoswami #ArnabAttacked— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) April 24, 2020
Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for State of Maharashtra, submitted that the statements uttered by Goswami during the program were highly provocative, and that he communalized the Palghar lynching incident, and made vicious and tarnishing comments against Congress President Sonia Gandhi.
Sibal termed the petition as based on "fake freedom of speech".
"You are trying to ignite communal violence here by putting Hindus against minority. You are creating communal violence by citing many such statements", Sibal argued.
He asserted that offences were clearly made out in the FIRs, and hence they could not be clubbed under an omnibus petition filed under Article 32.
Is Goswami a "privileged person" that no investigation can be carried out against him, Sibal asked.
Senior Advocate Dr AM Singhvi, appearing for State of Rajasthan, submitted that the offences under Sections 153A and 153B of IPC are non-bailable.
The FIRs were filed alleging that the news debates led by him on the Palghar lynching incident in Maharashtra amounted to promotion of enmity between groups, creation of communal disharmony, promotion of feeling against national integration etc. The FIRs mentioned offences under Sections 153A, 153B, 295A, 500, 504, 505 etc of the Indian Penal Code.
In the writ petition filed in the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution, the Republic TV Editor-in-Chief contended that the FIRs were in response to the broadcasts made by his channel linking Congress to the Palghar incident.
He contended that the FIRs were lodged at the instance of Indian National Congress to "coerce, harass and intimidate the petitioner in order to muzzle the media and in particular the petitioner, and conducting investigative journalism to bring the truth before the public". Therefore, the criminal actions resulted in the infringement of his fundamental right to speech under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, the petition stated.
Goswami stated that following the news broadcast against Congress, there was a coordinated attack against him in social media. He added that he had to face attack from two individuals at the midnight of April 23, while he and his wife were returning from the studio. Citing apprehensions about similar attacks in future, he sought directions to the Centre for protection to himself and his family members.
In the petition, Goswami asserted that his news programs on Palghar incident did not promote any sort of communal disharmony, and that the criminal actions against him were result of the offence taken by Congress party.
"Contrary to the tenor of allegations in the complaints filed against the Petitioner, the Petitioner has time and again encouraged and used the platform of its channel to foster communal harmony, especially in the present critical time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the Petitioner has been strongly opposed to any propagation of any communalization by various other political parties for their own vested interests.
It is inconceivable that the broadcast aired on 21 April 2020 in relation to the Palghar incident could have incited any communal tension and it is apparent that only one political party is taking offence on the broadcast."
The allegations in the Complaints and the FIRs are merely "conjectures and surmises" based on a "complete and vindictive misreading of only a miniscule part of the broadcast", the plea stated.
The Press Council of India condemned the attack on Goswami and issued a statement that "violence was not the answer even against bad journalism".

The Supreme Court observed that mode of entry in service is not a relevant criteria for promotion under PwD quota.
"Source of recruitment ought not to make any difference but what is material is that the employee is a PwD at the time for consideration for promotion. The 1995 Act does not make a distinction between a person who may have entered service on account of disability and a person who may have acquired disability after having entered the service.", the bench comprising Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and R. Subhash Reddy said in its judgment holding that persons with physical disabilities have right to reservation in promotions also
In this case, Leesamma Joseph, was appointed as a typist/clerk in Police Department in 1996 on compassionate grounds as her brother had passed away while in service. She suffered from permanent disability of 55% on account of Polio. She raised a claim that she was entitled to promotion as a Senior Clerk with effect from 1st July, 2002 with all consequential benefits and as a Cashier with effect from 20th May, 2012 with all consequential benefits and thereafter as Junior Superintendent with effect from the date of her entitlement. This claim was based on the PwD Act 1995.  The Kerala Administrative Tribunal rejected her plea sating that the rule of Recruitment in the State of Kerala, General Rules and other orders issued by the Government under Section 32 of the 1995 Act did not provide for any reservation in promotions. Later, the Kerala High Court, set aside the decision of the Kerala Administrative Tribunal.
Before the Supreme Court, the appellants contended that, though the employee suffered from physical disability, she was not appointed through a recruitment process under the 1995 Act, but was appointed on compassionate grounds on the demise of her brother. It was thus submitted that she could not claim any right to reservation in promotion under the 1995 Act.
Rejecting this contention, the bench observed that Iit would be discriminatory and violative of the mandate of the Constitution of India if the candidate is not considered for promotion in the PwD quota on this pretext. It said:
"27. It would be discriminatory and violative of the mandate of the Constitution of India if the respondent is not considered for promotion in the PwD quota on this pretext. Once the respondent has been appointed, she is to be identically placed as others in the PwD cadre. The anomaly which would arise from the submission of the appellant-State is apparent - a person who came in through normal recruitment process but suffers disability after joining service would on a pari materia position be also not entitled to be considered to a vacancy in a promotional post reserved for a PwD. This is the consequence if the entry point is treated as determinative of the entitlement to avail of the benefits. Source of recruitment ought not to make any difference but what is material is that the employee is a PwD at the time for consideration for promotion. The 1995 Act does not make a distinction between a person who may have entered service on account of disability and a person who may have acquired disability after having entered the service. Similarly, the same position would be with the person who may have entered service on a claim of a compassionate appointment. The mode of entry in service cannot be a ground to make out a case of discriminatory promotion."
  

While granting relief to a hotel owner, the Madras High Court has recently held that there is no prohibition under law for providing Hookah services in restaurants if same is run conforming to the provisions of “Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, supply and Distribution) Act, 2003” and also “The Prohibition of Smoking in Public Places Rules, 2008”.
The court noted that as per law, a separate smoking area, i.e. a separately ventilated smoking area with the board “Smoking Area” in English or one Indian language is a must. The restaurants should further display the Health advisory message against smoking at the entrance of the restaurant and that the entry of persons below 18 years should be prohibited.
Justice G Chandrasekharan thus directed the police authorities not to harass the restaurant owner or interfere with him running the restaurant if the Hookah service was being run according to law. If otherwise, the authorities had liberty to take appropriate legal action.
this Court disposed this writ petition with a direction to the respondent police not to harass the petitioner or his staff and also not to interfere with the petitioner's running of restaurant “Kafe Latte” along with Hookah service, if the Hookah service is being run conforming to the provisions of “Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, supply and Distribution) Act, 2003” and also “The Prohibition of Smoking in Public Places Rules, 2008”. If there is violation of any provisions under this Act, it is open to the respondents to take appropriate legal action.
The petitioner had submitted that he had all necessary licenses for running the business. The Hookah was served in a designated smoking area to customers above the age of 21 years in accordance with all the guidelines. He also submitted that proper warning boards and signs regarding health hazards were placed at conspicuous places and that the restaurant was not situated anywhere near 100 yards of educational institutions.
The petitioner further submitted that the police had filed an FIR against him for having materials for making "Hookah" when Hookah was not even a banned substance.
The State, on the other hand, supported the FIR by submitting that there was no specific zone in the restaurant. It was also submitted that the restaurant was functioning near schools and colleges and might spoil the students thus injuring their health.
The State further submitted that it had implemented a Bill to amend the “Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, supply and Distribution) Act prohibiting hookah bars.
The court however observed that until the Act was introduced in the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly, it could not be given effect to. Further, there was already an injunction order against the police authorities from interfering with the working of petitioner's restaurant and providing hookah services in specific smoking zones.
The court noted that the materials seized from the restaurant were hookah pots, Tubes, Alufo-Aluminium foils and premium coconut charcoal. Since smoking hookah was not prohibited, the court noted that the FIR was based on wrong understanding of law.
Case Title: Jay Shah v. The Commissioner of Police and others

The Karnataka High Court has said that a wife can claim maintenance under two different enactments, particularly after having been granted maintenance under a particular statute.
 A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna rejected a petition filed by the husband challenging an order passed by the Family Court granting interim maintenance of Rs.30,000 to his wife under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. He argued that the wife was already in receipt of Rs. 20,000 maintenance in proceedings instituted under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.
Rejecting this contention, the High Court said,
 "The Apex Court in the case of Rajnesh (supra) has clearly observed that in the light of overlapping of jurisdictions, the grant of maintenance under Section 20(1)(d) of the DV Act would be in addition to the maintenance granted under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. and also further holds that there is no bar to seek maintenance both under the DV Act and under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. or under the Hindu Marriage Act or even under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956."
The Court clarified that the only rider would be that the amount would not overlap and it would be inclusive of maintenance under each jurisdiction and not exclusive.
Coming to the next contention of the petitioner that he has lost his job and is not in a position to maintain his wife, the bench said "A perusal at the order impugned in the petition would clearly indicate that liability statements were placed before the concerned Court and the income of the husband is noticed and the fact that the wife has resigned her job and is residing in Mangalore is also noticed in addition to noticing that the petitioner continues to work in a particular Company at Bangalore. On noticing all these facts maintenance is awarded."
 It also refused to hear the contention that the wife has deliberately resigned from her job after initiation of divorce proceedings only to harass the petitioner. It said that this would be a matter of evidence in trial.
 Then referring to the apex court judgment in the case of Anju Garg and another v. Deepak Kumar Garg, the High Court reiterated that if the husband is an able bodied man, it is his duty to maintain his wife. It said, "The petitioner continues to work is what is not in dispute as is observed in the impugned order. Therefore, it becomes necessary for the petitioner to maintain his wife, by paying interim maintenance."

Unfortunately, POSCO Act does not distinguish between rape and consensual sexual interactions, the Court added.The Kerala High Court on Wednesday expressed its concerns over adolescents being unaware of the consequences of having sexual relationships with each other, even if they are consensual, under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the amended Section 376 of IPC. 
Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas was adjudicating upon a bail application when he commented on the alarming rise in the number of sexual offences being committed against school children, most of them being cases where teenagers indulged in sexual relationships, oblivious to the severe consequences under the POCSO Act. 
"Young children, irrespective of gender, indulge in such acts, unmindful of the drastic consequences that await them. The amendments brought into the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the enactment of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, envisage very harsh consequences for such offensive acts. Unfortunately, the statute does not distinguish between the conservative concept of the term rape and the sexual interactions arising out of pure affection and biological changes."
At this point, the Single Judge also added that unfortunately, the POCSO Act sticks to a conservative idea of rape, without any regard to normal teenage feelings and urges.
"The statutes do not contemplate the biological inquisitiveness of adolescence and treat all 'intrusions' on bodily autonomy, whether by consent or otherwise, as rape for certain age group of victims." 
It added that teenagers and adolescents indulge in sexual relationships unmindful of the consequences and that by the time they realise them, it would be too late.
"A meaningful life could practically be snuffed out by an immature or negligent act arising out of human curiosity or biological cravings, which psychologists regard as natural." 
Although ignorance of law is not an excuse, (ignorantia juris non excusat), the Court found it imperative that school children be made aware of the POCSO Act. Therefore, the State and the Department of Education were asked to take necessary steps to raise awareness of the same by including it in the curriculum if possible. 
"The curriculum must of necessity prescribe sessions/classes on the provisions of the POCSO Act as well as the amendments brought into section 376 of IPC. The educational machinery of the State has fallen woefully short in imparting the required awareness to the young children about the heinous crimes and its consequences." 
To study the prospects of raisisng awareness, the Court suo moto impleaded the State Department of Education, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Kerala State Legal Services Authority into the plea to issue directions for paving the way for better awareness on the statutes concerned in schools in the State. 
"Time has come for this Court to step in to explore the possibilities of methods in which the awareness can be created," the order said. 
The matter will be heard again on June 27.
Case Title: Anoop v State of Kerala & Ors. 

The Supreme Court observed that the tendering of affidavits and undertakings containing false statement would amount to contempt of court.
A person who makes a false statement before the Court and makes an attempt to deceive the Court, interferes with the administration of justice and is guilty of contempt of Court, the bench comprising Justices UU Lalit and PS Narasimha observed.
Last year, the the Court had recalled an order granting custody of a child to a Kenyan citizen of Indian origin after finding that he had played fraud on the court and had approached it with "unclean hands" by suppressing material facts. It had also initiated contempt proceedings against one of the parties for having violated the undertakings.
While considering this case, the court noticed an earlier decision on the question whether tendering of affidavits and undertakings containing false statement would amount to criminal contempt or not. Referring to ABCD v. Union of India, the court said:
"15. It is thus well settled that a person who makes a false statement before the Court and makes an attempt to deceive the Court, interferes with the administration of justice and is guilty of contempt of Court. The extracted portion above clearly shows that in such circumstances, the Court not only has the inherent power but it would be failing in its duty if the alleged contemnor is not dealt with in contempt jurisdiction for abusing the process of the Court."
The bench therefore held that Perry is guilty of having committed criminal contempt of Court apart from the contempt for violating express undertakings given to the Courts, including this Court.
"Though the instant proceedings can be taken to logical conclusion and order of sentence can be awarded even in the absence of Perry, we give final opportunity to Perry to present himself before this Court on 22.07.2022 at 3.00 pm along with .... He shall then have an opportunity to advance appropriate submissions on the issue of punishment to be awarded to him. It shall also be open to Perry to purge himself of contempt in which case a sympathetic view may be taken in the matter.", the court observed.

The Supreme Court has observed that illegal use of a licensed or sanctioned weapon per se does not constitute an offence under Section 27 of the Arms Act, 1959 ("Act"), without proving the misdemeanour u/s 5 or 7 of the Act.
The Court also observed that at best, it could be a 'misconduct' under the service rules.
The bench of CJI NV NV Ramana, Justices Surya Kant and AS Bopanna in the present matter was considering a criminal appeal against Punjab and Haryana High Court's order dated May 19, 2010 ("impugned order").
As per the impugned order, the High Court had confirmed the order of conviction and sentence dated July 25, 2006 passed by Additional Sessions Judge, Chandigarh of the appellant who was convicted under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 ('IPC') and Section 27 of the Act and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of 3 years for both the offences, with a direction that sentences will run concurrently.
While partly allowing the appeal by setting aside conviction and sentence u/s 27 of the Act but maintaining conviction u/s 307 IPC, the bench in observed,
"The Appellant was admittedly a police official at the time of the incident and the arms and ammunition used for the commission of the offence, were placed in his possession under the sanction accorded by the Competent Authority. The Appellant being in authorised possession of the weapon, cannot be said to have used an unlicensed weapon, as prohibited under Section 5 of the Arms Act. It appears that the Trial Court was swayed by irrelevant considerations such as illegal use of the weapon, and lost track of the objective of the Statute, which has been enacted to provide a licensing/regulatory regime, to enable law­ abiding citizens to carry arms, and also to prohibit the possession, acquisition, manufacture, etc. of certain categories of firearms, unless authorized by the Central Government."
"...the llegal use of a licensed or sanctioned weapon per se does not constitute an offence under Section 27, without proving the misdemeanour under Section 5 or 7 of the Arms Act. At best, it could be a 'misconduct' under the service rules, the determination of which was not the subject of the trial", the Court held. 
Factual Background
On July 10, 1999, the appellant entered Complainant's residential office in an inebriated condition and stating that he was a beat officer of the lane, asked for a glass of water. After consuming the water served to him, the Appellant threatened the Complainant by pointing the pistol at him and asked him to stand and raise his hands. He thereafter moved around the table towards the Complainant, pulled the lever and made himself ready to fire. Sensing the seriousness of the situation, Complainant lunged at the Appellant and pushed his hand towards the ceiling, which resulted in the bullet, fired from the pistol, hitting the ceiling of the office.
The Appellant then attempted to fire a second time, however, he was unable to and in the said exercise a bullet fell from his pistol. While the ladies of the office entered the office and raised a holler, panic-stricken, the Appellant rushed out of the office, left behind his wireless set on the Complainant's table and his scooter outside the house.
The Trial Court convicted the Appellant under Section 307 IPC and Section 27 of the Act and awarded a sentence of rigorous imprisonment for 3 years.
Discontented with his conviction, the Appellant preferred an appeal before the High Court of Punjab & Haryana. The High Court upon reappraisal of the evidence, sustained conviction and the consequential sentence imposed by the Trial Court and dismissed the appeal.
Aggrieved, the Appellant approached the Top Court. 
Contention Of The Counsels 
The appellant's counsel raised four principal contentions, First, that there was an absence of 'motive' on behalf of the Appellant to kill the Complainant. Second, there was an absence of intent, which could not be imputed from the Appellant's conduct. Third, doubts were sought to be created through re appreciation of evidence once again, including, by depicting that the statements of the eye witnesses suffered from material contradictions, fatal to the prosecution's case. Fourthly that conviction u/s 27 of the Arms Act was not sustainable as the weapon used by the Appellant was licensed and misuse of a licensed weapon was not a mischief under Section 5 of the Arms Act.
Supreme Court's Analysis
One of the issues that arose for consideration was whether Appellant's conviction under Section 27 of the Arms Act was sustainable. 
In this regards, the bench in the judgement authored by Justice Surya Kant observed that there was no gainsay that in order to prove a charge u/s 27 of the Act, the prosecution must necessarily demonstrate contravention of either Section 5 or Section 7 of the Act.
The bench further opined that it appeared that the Trial Court had held the case to be a breach of Section 5 of the Act, which stipulated that no person shall use, possess, manufacture, etc. any firearms, unless such person holds a license in this behalf, and prescribes a minimum punishment of 3 years of imprisonment.
Thereafter while setting aside the conviction u/s 27 of the Act, the bench said, "True it is that prior to the amendment of Section 27 of the Arms Act, vide Arms (Amendment) Act 1988, the said provision penalized the use of any arms and ammunitions for any 'unlawful purpose'. However, post its amendment, Section 27 of the Arms Act is strictly confined to violation of conditions mentioned either under Section 5 or 7 of the Arms Act and the 'unlawful purpose' of using arms and ammunition is no longer an inseparable component of the delinquency."

The Supreme Court observed that High Courts should refrain from excercising writ jurisdiction there is an alternate remedy available.
When there is an alternate remedy available, judicial prudence demands that the court refrains from exercising its jurisdiction under constitutional provisions, the bench of Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna observed.
The bench observed thus while allowing an appeal filed against a judgment of High Court which allowed a writ petition filed against an order passed by Assessing Officer determining the tax liability along with interest and penalty under Maharashtra Value Added Tax, 2002 and Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.
Advocate Sachin Patil, for the appellants,  contended that against the assessment order passed by the Assessing Officer under the provisions of the MVAT Act and CST Act, the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The assessee had a statutory alternative remedy available by way of appeal before the first appellate authority and the said remedy ought to have been pursued, it was urged. Senior Advocate Rafique Dada justified the impugned judgment contending that for an earlier assessment order, there was a decision against the assessee by the first appellate authority on merits and therefore it may be a formality to prefer an appeal before the first appellate authority and hence the writ petitioner rightly filed the writ petition before the High Court.
The bench observed that the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India challenging the assessment order in view of the availability of statutory remedy under the Act. The bench said:
"It is required to be noted that against the assessment order passed by the Assessing Officer under the provisions of the MVAT Act and CST Act, the assessee straightway preferred writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. It is not in dispute that the statutes provide for the right of appeal against the assessment order passed by the Assessing Officer and against the order passed by the first appellate authority, an appeal/revision before the Tribunal. In that view of the matter, the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India challenging the assessment order in view of the availability of statutory remedy under the Act."
The court observed that the question is not about the maintainability of the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, but about the entertainability of the writ petition against the order of assessment by-passing the statutory remedy of appeal.

Satyawati Tondon and others (2010) 8 SCC 110. (Para 6-8)

The Allahabad High Court recently observed that a period of 1.5 years is an 'extremely unreasonable long time' to keep disciplinary proceedings pending against an employee after the submission of an inquiry report.
The bench of Justice Alok Mathur observed so while dealing with the case of one Yatendra Kumar (suspended General Manager, U.P. Nirman Nigam Ltd), challenging his suspension order passed by the UP Government in June 2020 in contemplation of departmental proceedings initiated against him.
It was his grievance that neither a show cause notice has been given to him, nor disciplinary proceedings been concluded despite the fact that an inquiry report has already been submitted to the Disciplinary Authority in March 2021.
It was his submission before the Court that as petitioner would be superannuated on 31st December 2022 and likely to retire during his suspension, therefore, pendency of the disciplinary proceedings would adversely affect his post-retiral dues and other service benefits admissible to him.
Taking note of the facts of the case and the arguments advanced, the Court opined that if the inquiry report was submitted in March, 2021, there was no reason as to why disciplinary proceedings have not been concluded within a reasonable time, thereafter. 
Further, when the Court was informed by the State's counsel that two weeks time is required for passing final orders in the matter, the Court though it appropriate to dispose of the plea wwith direction to the competent authority to conclude the inquiry proceedings within maximum period of three weeks. 
Significantly, the Court further observed that in case disciplinary proceedings are not concluded within the time prescribed above, the impugned order of suspension dated June 1, 2020 would cease to exist.
Senior Advocate S.C. Misra assisted by Advocate Shivanshu Goswami appeared for the petitioner.
Case title - Yatendra Kumar v. State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief Secy./Prin. Secy. Public Works Deptt. Lko. And 4 Others [WRIT - A No. - 2670 of 2022]

Punjab and Haryana High Court, while dealing with a case where the petitioner questioned deletion of Rule 134A of the Haryana School Education Rules, 2003 on the ground that it was not laid before the House of the State Legislature for prior approval which is a requirement under Section 24 of the Haryana School Education Act, 1995, upheld the State Gazette Notification publishing such deletion.
 The Bench comprising Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli further noted that the as per Section 24 (3) of the Haryana School Education Act, 1995 laying of the Rules before the House of the State Legislature is not a provision requiring prior laying but the Rule has to be laid before the House of the State Legislature, soon after it is made.
 Language of the provision is clear and when confronted with the same, learned senior counsel for the petitioner fairly concedes that the aforesaid provision stipulates and provides for laying of the Rule before the House of the State Legislature as soon as may be after it is made.
 The court further noted above provision is directory and not mandatory and does not require prior laying of the Rule.
 In such circumstances, as the provision of the Statute is directory and not mandatory and does not require prior laying of the Rule, it is evident that the notification dated 28.03.2022 (P-4) deleting the provision of Rule 134A from the Rules of 2003 has come into force from the date it has publication and as on date, Rule 134A does not exist on the Statute book. 
 The Court was dealing with a petition seeking issuance of directions to the Respondents to issue the Schedule for admission in Class 2nd - 8th under Rule 134A of the Rules of 2003 (amended in 2013) for the academic session 2022-2023. Rule 134A makes provision for reservation in admission to private schools for poor meritorious students to the extent of 10%. 
 In view of the aforesaid legal and factual position, the court dismissed the petition.

The Supreme Court observed that the principle of preferential candidates would apply when there is a tie between the preferential candidate and a general candidate and the person who is to be treated as a preferential can be given a mark over a general candidate.
Rule 55 of Tamil Nadu State and Subordinate Service Rules read thus: Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules or in the Special Rules for the various State and Subordinate Service, other things being equal, preference shall be given to the Outstanding scouts for appointment to any post by direct recruitment.
In this case, the Madras High Court had directed TANGEDCO to consider the claim of a candidate for appointment to the post of Assistant Engineer in the priority category in the post earmarked for Scheduled Caste. The court had relied on Rule 55 of the Service Rules. In appeal filed against this judgment, the Apex Court noted that the said Rules provided for "preference only " and not priority.
"The principle of preferential candidates would apply when there is a tie between the preferential candidate and a general candidate and the person who is to be treated as a preferential can be given a mark over a general candidate. This is the most material distinction. In view thereof, the respondent could not have been treated as a "preferential candidate" much less a "priority candidate".", the bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh said.
The court observed that the question of preference, even if it had to work in favour of the candidate, would arise if she was identically situated as the other candidates in terms of the marks and would then get the preference. In this regard, the bench referred to observations made in Secy., A.P. Public Service Commission v. Y.V.V.R. Srinivasulu, (2003) 5 SCC 341:
"10. … The word "preference" in our view is capable of different shades of meaning taking colour from the context, purpose and object of its use under the scheme of things envisaged. Hence, it is to be construed not in an isolated or detached manner, ascribing a meaning of universal import, for all contingencies capable of an invariable application. The procedure for selection in the case involves a qualifying test, a written examination and an oral test or interview and the final list of selection has to be on the basis of the marks obtained in them. The suitability and all-round merit, if had to be adjudged in that manner only, what justification could there be for overriding all these merely because, a particular candidate is in possession of an additional qualification on the basis of which, a preference has also been envisaged. The Rules do not provide for separate classification of those candidates or apply different norms of selection for them. The "preference" envisaged in the Rules, in our view, under the scheme of things and contextually also cannot mean, an absolute en bloc preference akin to reservation or separate and distinct method of selection for them alone. A mere rule of preference meant to give weightage to the additional qualification cannot be enforced as a rule of reservation or rule of complete precedence. Such a construction would not only undermine the scheme of selection envisaged through the Public Service Commission on the basis of merit performance but also would work great hardship and injustice to those who possess the required minimum educational qualification with which they are entitled to compete with those possessing additional qualification too, and demonstrate their superiority meritwise and their suitability for the post. It is not to be viewed as a preferential right conferred even for taking up their claims for consideration. On the other hand, the preference envisaged has to be given only when the claims of all candidates who are eligible are taken for consideration and when any one or more of them are found equally positioned, by using the additional qualification as a tilting factor, in their favour vis-à-vis others in the matter of actual selection. 
11.Whenever, a selection is to be made on the basis of merit performance involving competition, and possession of any additional qualification or factor is also envisaged to accord preference, it cannot be for the purpose of putting them as a whole lot ahead of others, dehors their intrinsic worth or proven inter se merit and suitability, duly assessed by the competent authority. Preference, in the context of all such competitive scheme of selection would only mean that other things being qualitatively and quantitatively equal, those with the additional qualification have to be preferred. There is no question of eliminating all others preventing thereby even an effective and comparative consideration on merits, by according en bloc precedence in favour of those in possession of additional qualification irrespective of the respective merits and demerits of all candidates to be considered."
The court observed that the High Court direction actually amounts to bringing the candidate in a "priority category" which could not have been done. The bench, taking note of the fact that the candidate is an outstanding scout who is recipient of a Presidential Award for her contribution as a scout, invoked its powers under Article 142 and observed thus: In view of the passage of time and the hopes and aspirations arising from the impugned orders, albeit on a wrong legal principle, in view of what has been volunteered by the learned senior counsel for the appellant the respondent would be accommodated in the post of Assistant Engineer (Electrical) but will be at the bottom of the seniority list and will get benefits only from the date of her appointment order which may be issued to her in a period of one month from today.

The Supreme Court observed that non­-independence and non-impartiality of an arbitrator would make him ineligible to conduct arbitration.
The bench of Justices MR Shah and Aniruddha Bose observed that the ineligibility of an arbitrator can be removed only by an 'express agreement'.
In this case , the distributorship agreement between various firms and Jaipur Zila Dugdh Utpadak Sahkari Sangh Limited contained an arbitrator clause, as per which all disputes and differences arising out of or in any way touching or concerning the agreement, had to be referred to the sole Arbitrator, the Chairman of the said Sahkari Sangh. Following a dispute between the firm and sangh, the arbitration proceedings were initated by the Chairman. During the pendency of the said arbitration proceedings, the firms approached the High Court for appointment of an arbitrator in exercise of powers under Section 11 of the Act. The High Court  allowed the said application and appointed a former District and Sessions Judge to act as an arbitrator.
In appeal filed by the Sangh before the Apex Court, the issue to be considered was whether the Chairman who is an elected member of the petitioner Sahkari Sangh can be said to be 'ineligible' under Sub­-section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule to the Act or not?  The Sangh's contention was that, in the Seventh Schedule to the Act 'Chairman' is not mentioned and only Manager, Director or part of the Management can be said to be ineligible.
Rejecting the said contention, the bench observed that the Chairman of the Sangh can certainly be held to be 'ineligible' to continue as an arbitrator. Referring to Voestalpine Schienen GMBH vs. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited, (2017) 4 SCC 665, the court said:
Sub­-section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule has been inserted bearing in mind the 'impartiality and independence' of the arbitrators. It has been inserted with the purpose of 'neutrality of arbitrators'. Independence and impartiality of the arbitrators are the hallmarks of any arbitration proceedings as observed in the case of Voestalpine Schienen (Supra). Rule against bias is one of the fundamental principles of natural justice which apply to all judicial proceedings and quasi-judicial proceedings and it is for this reason that despite the contractually agreed upon, the persons mentioned in Sub­section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule to the Act would render himself ineligible to conduct (Para 8)
The court said that, though the word 'Chairman' is specifically not mentioned, he would fall in the category of the following clauses: 
(1) The arbitrator is an employee, consultant, advisor or has any other past or present business relationship with a party. (2) The arbitrator currently represents or advises one of the parties or an affiliate of one of the parties. (5) The arbitrator is a manager, director or part of the management, or has a similar controlling influence, in an affiliate of one of the parties if the affiliate is directly involved in the matters in dispute in the arbitration.(12) The arbitrator is a manager, director or part of the management, or has a similar controlling influence in one of the parties. (Para 9)
The Court said that disqualification conditions under Sub­section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule to the Act is to be read as a whole and considering the object and purpose for which Sub­section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule to the Act came to be inserted.
The court also rejected the contention that since the party participated in the arbitration proceedings before the sole arbitrator – Chairman, it ought not to have approached the High Court for appointment of arbitrator under Section 11. The court, referring to Section 12(5) proviso, observed that there must be an 'express agreement' in writing to remove the ineligibility of the arbitrator. It referred to the following observations made in Bharat Broadband Network Limited vs United Telecoms Limited (2019) 5 SCC 755;,
5. Section 12(5), on the other hand, is a new provision which relates to the de jure inability of an arbitrator to act as such. Under this provision, any prior agreement to the contrary is wiped out by the non­ obstante clause in Section 12(5) the moment any person whose relationship with the parties or the counsel or the subject matter of the dispute falls under the Seventh Schedule. The subsection then declares that such person shall be "ineligible" to be appointed as arbitrator. The only way in which this ineligibility can be removed is by the proviso, which again is a special provision which states that parties may, subsequent to disputes having arisen between them, waive the applicability of Section 12(5) by an express agreement in writing. What is clear, therefore, is that where, under any agreement between the parties, a person falls within any of the categories set out in the Seventh Schedule, he is, as a matter of law, ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. The only way in which this ineligibility can be removed, again, in law, is that parties may after disputes have arisen between them, waive the applicability of this subsection by an "express agreement in writing". Obviously, the "express agreement in writing" has reference to a person who is interdicted by the Seventh Schedule, but who is stated by parties (after the disputes have arisen between them) to be a person in whom they have faith notwithstanding the fact that such person is interdicted by the Seventh Schedule. (Para 10)

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently observed that Police is not supposed to act as a super boss of the public administration system.
 A bench of Justice Rahul Bharti observed,
 "In case any public servant is to be subjected to a surveillance mode by a rank holder police official on the pretext of a complaint received without first entertaining the said complaint into a formal process, then surely the very confidence of the public servant in acting and doing his duty will be subjected to a paralysis".
 The Court was hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner, employed as a Junior Engineer in PHE Department, had called in question a course of action in which the Superintendent of Police Doda had entertained an anonymous complaint addressed against him and the action of SHO, addressing the impugned letter to the Petitioner's Head of Department asking for the information concerning the petitioner who is working under him.
 The petitioner in his plea sought to attribute the filing of this anonymous complaint against him to vested interests operating against him who are having political score to settle with his father-in-law.
 The petitioners further contended that all this stated aspect of the case had no bearing in the context of the legal aspect, which is the competence of the respondent SSP Doda & SHO P/S Doda to seize the said anonymous complaint and use it at their own level without even registering it as an FIR. 
 Adjudicating upon the matter, Justice Bharti frowned over the manner police has acted in the matter and observed that the perusal of the objections filed on behalf of respondents would show that it is no where disclosed as to how respondent no. 2 i.e. the Superintendent of Police Doda entertained the said complaint instead of referring it to the petitioner's Head of the Department that being the Chief Engineer. 
 The bench questioned the action of the respondents by recording that it is not even forthcoming as to how come the respondent Station House Officer, Police Station Doda came to have the said anonymous complaint to his end for the purposes of immediately acting upon it by addressing a letter to the respondent Executive Engineer, PHE Division Doda thereby asking for information about the petitioner. 
 Examining the position from the legal standpoint the bench noted that in the face of the nature of the allegations levelled in the said anonymous complaint, it is is unable to figure out as to under which enabling provision of law the respondent Station House Officer Police Station Doda came to address this impugned communication on the pretext of a complaint against the petitioner to the respondent Executive Engineer, PHE Division Doda. 
The respondent no. 4 had not registered any FIR or even a preliminary inquiry into the matter so as to make formal and official the alleged exercise so undertaken on his part in addressing the impugned communication to the respondent no. 3 i.e. the Executive Engineer, PHE Division Doda, the bench recorded. 
 "It is strange that the author of the anonymous complaint in the complaint has no where mentioned the fact as to why he/she has chosen to address the complaint directly to the Superintendent of Police, Doda and not to the Chief Engineer concerned and there is also no reference in the complaint that the complainant had in fact first apprised the Chief Engineer concerned or the superior officers of the petitioner about the alleged acts of omission and commission on the part of the petitioner related to his official status and position. This aspect does show that the said anonymous complaint was nothing but a set up aimed to harass a public servant", Justice Bharti observed. 
 Allowing the petition, the bench accordingly quashed the impugned communication issued by the Station House officer, Police Station Doda to the Executive Engineer, PHE Division Doda.

The Madras High Court on Thursday ruled that it is mandatory for the teachers, who did not possess the minimum qualification of pass in TET prior to RTE Act, 2009 to acquire the same within the period of nine years i.e., within 31.03.2019. Thus, the teachers, who do not possess the minimum qualification of pass in TET are not entitled to continue their service in the schools/educational institutions.
 The bench of Justice D Krishnakumar were hearing petitions filed by a teacher to sanction annual increment to them in the B.T. Assistant posts as well as incentive increment for having acquired Post Graduation, without reference to passing of Teachers Eligibility Test (TET) with all consequential and other attendant benefits.
 Background
 After the introduction of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, the National Council for Technical Education (NCTE) was appointed as academic authority under Section 23(1) of the Act. 
 The council issued notification prescribing educational qualification for teachers taking classes for Standards I to VIII, which include passing of Teachers Eligibility Test [TET] to be conducted by the appropriate Government
 State Government has issued G.O.Ms.No.181, School Education Department, dated 15.11.2011, appointing Teachers Recruitment Board [TRB] as Nodal Agency to conduct TET and also to make appointment to the post of Secondary Grade Teachers based on TET.
 The petitioners contented that they were appointed prior to 2011 and their appointment was also duly approved by the Department without any condition much prior to G.O.Ms.No.181 dated 15.11.2011 and they were paid with annual increments from the date of their initial appointment, but suddenly this payment was stopped on the premise that the petitioner had not passed TET Test.
 Therefore, insistence of TET is totally arbitrary and unreasonable. For this reason, they have filed this petition to direct the respondents to sanction annual increment to the petitioners in the post of B.T. Assistants as well as incentive increment for having acquired Post Graduation without reference to passing of TET with all consequential and other attendant benefits.
 The court highlighted that that despite lapse of many years i.e., almost twelve years after the enactment of RTE Act, 2009, the said statutory provision has not been complied with, the petitioners and teachers are allowed to continue in service without possessing the minimum eligibility condition of pass in TET, as per Section 23 of the RTE Act, 2009 and also as per the RTE (Amendment Act), 2017.
 The court stated that teaching is a profession which requires knowledge and skills and quality in teaching is the need of the hour.
 "Education is a process of acquiring knowledge and skills in general, and the field of teachers' education is special. Quality teachers' education is the need of the hour. Effective teaching depends on the teacher with updated knowledge, skills and technology. The main purpose of the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) is to assess the candidate's aptitude for the profession, that is, to assess the teachers whether they have adequate teaching competency and a positive attitude towards teaching or not. The rationale for including the TET as a minimum eligibility criterion for a person to be appointed as a teacher is to bring national standards and benchmark for quality in the recruitment process and to lay special emphasis on teachers' quality. It is necessary to ensure teachers with the essential aptitude and ability are recruited to meet the challenges of teaching and for the benefit of student community at large, the teachers should be competent enough with national standards. This would ensure that despite alternate pathways open to become teachers, standards of teaching are maintained"
 The court held that it is mandatory for the teachers, who did not possess the minimum qualification of pass in TET prior to RTE Act, 2009 to acquire the same within the period of nine years i.e., within 31.03.2019. Thus, the teachers, who do not possess the minimum qualification of pass in TET are not entitled to continue their service in the schools/educational institutions. Thus, they could also not seek increments.
 The petitioners had also contented that the Government has not been conducting TET examination every year as it should and therefore appropriate direction may be given to the State Government to instruct Teachers Recruitment Board for conducting TET examination every year, so as to enable the teachers to qualify themselves in TET.
 To this, Mr. S Silambanan, Additional Advocate General that the Board has notified for conducting TET examinations in the month of June 2022 and teachers, who have not qualified shall participate in the ensuing examinations. 
 Mr.R.Sankaranarayanan, Additional Solicitor General, submitted that the extended time limit of further period of four years as per the RTE (Amendment) Act, 2017, had expired on 31.03.2019 and  the Central Government has not considered any request for further extension of time and would add that only by way of amendment to Section 23 of the RTE Act.
 Mr Vimal B. Crimson, Mr R Kamaraj and Mr G Sankaran appeared for the petitioners while the respondents were represented by Additional Advocate General Mr. S Silambanan assisted by Mr V. Nanmaran and Assistant Solicitor General Mr R Sankaranarayanan assisted by Mr. T.L Thirumalaisamy.

The Madras High Court has observed that for a woman to claim the benefits of EPF Pension scheme after her deserted husband, it is necessary for her to lodge an FIR and get a police certificate as to whether he is alive or not.
A single bench of Justice S Vaidyanathan made this observation while disposing of a writ petition filed by a woman, who was seeking the pensionary benefits under the Employees Pension Scheme after her son died. The petitioner said that her husband had deserted the family in 2005. Therefore, she prayed for a direction to the EPF authorities to release the pensionary benefits to her as per the nomination made by her son, without insisting on her husband's particulars.
The counsel for the EPFO told the bench that in terms of 16 (5)(aa) of the Employees Pension Scheme 1995 , in case of non-nomination, the father of the deceased would be entitled to get full pension and in the event of death of the father, mother would be entitled to pension till she survives.   He further submitted that the writ petitioner should have filed FIR pertaining to the complaint given by her on account of missing of her husband and if his whereabouts are not found, she ought to have obtained certificate from the police, thereafter produce the same in order to enable the EPF authorities to process the papers and extend pensionery benefits to the petitioner. Since, the same has not been done, EPF will not be in a position to release any amount against the provisions of pension scheme 1995.
The petitioner's counsel voiced the apprehension that the police may not entertain the complaint now as the petitioner's husband deserted her 15 years ago.
The bench observed that the petitioner should have obtained the clearance from the police to claim the benefits. It noted that as per the scheme, the father of the deceased is entitled to pension and in the event of demise of the father, mother-wife is entitled to pension till she is alive.
"Since, the deceased is a Bachelor, the writ-petitioner ought to have given the complaint on missing of her husband and ought to have obtained a certificate from the police, in order to get pensionery benefits, but the same has not been done", the bench observed.
However, to redress the grievance of the petitioner, the Court allowed her to make a complaint before the police with respect to the missing of her husband within one month from the date of receipt of the copy of the court order. The police officers should accept such a complaint when it is made by the petitioner, and they are to verify and issue a certificate as to whether the person is alive or not traceable, the bench directed.
"On a production of said certificate, writ petitioner who is the mother of the deceased shall be extended with the pensionery benefits, as the narrow interpretation of Section 16 (5)(aa) cannot be given, more so, in the peculiar circumstances of the case", the bench observed.

[NOTE: This order has been set aside by the Division Bench of the High Court and the Girl has been granted permission to abort the fetus. More details here: "Not Necessary That Rape Allegation Is Proved Before S. 3 Of MTP Act Is Invoked": MP HC (DB) Allows Abortion, Sets Aside Single Judge Order]
The Madhya Pradesh High Court (Gwalior Bench) recently refused to permit medical termination of pregnancy (of more than 12 weeks) of a 19-year-old girl who had alleged, that on the pretext of marriage, one Rocky, whom she loved, had committed rape on her without her consent.
She alleged before the court that the man had promised that he would marry her, and on this pretext, he was having a physical relationship with her for the last 4-5 years but when she became pregnant, he refused to marry her, therefore, she sought permission to terminate her pregnancy.
Noting that the allegation of the prosecutrix was that she was in deep love with the man and she was having consensual sex with him, the Bench of Justice G. S. Ahluwalia refused permission to abort the fetus and observed thus:
"The petitioner is aged about 19 years, therefore, she is mature enough to realize the consequences of consensual sex without any precaution."
The question before the court
It may be noted that as per the provisions of Sub-Section (2) of Section 3 of the Act, 1971 Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, where the length of the pregnancy exceeds twelve weeks but does not exceed twenty weeks, then the pregnancy could be terminated if:
Not less than two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion, in good faith,That the continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury physical or mental health/
Also, explanation (1) appended to the sub-section (2) says that where the pregnancy is caused by rape, the anguish shall be presumed to constitute a grave injury to mental health. 
Against this backdrop, the pivotal question for consideration before the Court was this- whether sex with the man was consensual sex or it was sex with the consent of the petitioner which was obtained by misrepresentation of fact?
This question assumed significance as if the consent for the physical relationship was obtained by misrepresentation of fact, then it would amount to rape and therefore, would come under the purview of explanation (1) appended to the sub-section (2) allowing termination of pregnancy with Court's permission.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court noted that in FIR itself, it was specifically mentioned that since the petitioner was in deep love with the man, therefore, she used to visit the house of Rocky Shakya in absence of his family members and they used to have consensual sex. 
"The petitioner is a major girl knowing fully well the pros and cons of consensual sex without any precaution. Even the FIR was lodged after it was detected that the petitioner is pregnant," added the court.
Further, the Court also noted that for the purpose of this writ petition, the Court had to only determine as to whether the permission for medical termination of pregnancy can be given or not specifically in the light of the provisions of IPC that the termination of pregnancy is otherwise an offence.
Therefore, dismissing the plea, the Court remarked thus:
"This Court is of the considered opinion that since the petitioner involved herself in a consensual sex knowing fully well about the consequences of such act, and the allegations made in FIR, do not prima facie make out a case of consent obtained by misrepresentation of fact, therefore, under these circumstances, medical termination of pregnancy cannot be permitted."
Case title - Prosecutrix Vs. The State of M.P. and others
Read Order

The Delhi High Court has observed that a party approaching the Court alleging contempt, cannot call upon the Court, in a contempt jurisdiction, to interpret the judicial order differently from the manner in which it reads and that only those directions which are plainly self-evident have to be taken into account to determine the violation or disobedience. 
Justice Jyoti Singh was dealing with a plea alleging contempt of judicial orders passed in a trademark infringement case, thereby seeking direction to hold the respondents guilty of gross, deliberate and continuing contempt of the orders. 
In 2006, the High Court had granted an ex parte ad interim injunction restraining the respondents from adopting or using the trademark 'JIVA' or any other identical or deceptively similar or confusing mark, in relation to their goods and services and from manufacturing, advertising and marketing, etc. any goods or services under the said trademark. 
In an appeal against the said order, the Division Bench had partly allowed the appeal, whereby the order restraining the respondents from using the trademark 'JIVA' for their Spas run in the hotels established by them, was vacated, subject to certain conditions, while the order to the extent it restrained the respondents from selling, using or offering for sale or use any ayurvedic product under the trademark 'JIVA', was confirmed.
It was argued that in 2014, when it came to the knowledge of the Petitioners that the orders were being violated, a contempt petition was filed, wherein, after hearing the parties extensively, the Court had taken on record the statement and assurance on behalf of the Respondents that they would not use the mark 'JIVA' in relation to disputed goods or for any cosmetic, soaps, ayurvedic, non ayurvedic, or any other allied and cognate goods, except in respect of 'JIVA' for Spa and in relation to pillow, towels, handkerchiefs and other articles related to the Spas.
It was thus the case of the Petitioners that recently, it had come to their notice that Respondent No.6, who was defendant no. 1 in the suit, had been advertising and marketing its non-ayurvedic products such as towels, under the trademark 'JIVA' on the websites of its hotels as well as through e-mails. 
It was averred that the Respondent No.6 was providing a written description of variety of Spa services and other therapeutic treatments available, including description of the ayurvedic products used therein, thereby indirectly advertising the products, against which there was a restraint order, leading to a deceptive association of its ayurvedic and non-ayurvedic products to the trademark 'JIVA'. 
Such advertisements, according to the petitioners were in clear violation of the order dated 17.10.2006 read with order dated 30.05.2008 and the assurance given by Respondent No.6 to the Court on 04.04.2016.
The Court was of the view that from a holistic reading of the aforesaid orders, it was evident that the Division Bench had vacated the earlier 2006 order to the extent it restrained the respondents from using the trademark 'JIVA' for their Spas run in their hotels, subject to certain conditions. 
"Clearly, there was no restraint on any advertisement or marketing with respect to running of the Spas, the services and facilities offered therein or articles such as pillows, towels, handkerchiefs, etc. related to the Spas, under the trademark 'JIVA'. Restraint order by the learned Single Judge, on offering for sale/use of the ayurvedic products under the trademark 'JIVA', as confirmed by the Division Bench in para 46(b) of the order, cannot be extended to running of the Spas and the articles used therein, which is evident from a plain and conjoint reading of paras 46(a) and 46(b) of the order dated 30.05.2008," the Court observed. 
The Court observed that a perusal of the documents, on which the Petitioners had predicated their allegations of contempt, reflected that Respondents had only advertised facilities and services rendered in their Spas along with pictures of the articles used in relation thereto. 
"Pictorial presentations indicate that Respondents have only given descriptions of the various therapies, Spa treatments etc. available at their Spas along with the benefits that flow out of the said treatments. Albeit the pictures in the e-mails and on the websites showcase certain products, however, the mark 'JIVA' is only reflected on the towels. The bottles alleged to be the infringing products do not contain any label or description so as to even remotely indicate or suggest that any ayurvedic or non-ayurvedic products under the trademark 'JIVA' are being advertised or marketed, in violation of the orders of the Court, as alleged by the Petitioners," the Court said. 
It noted that each of the articles depicted in the pictures were those which were related to the Spas, particularly, the towels, and fall within the window of permitted user, by virtue of the order of the Division Bench and statement given to the Court on behalf of Respondent No.6. 
The Court therefore observed that the power vested in the High Court to punish for contempt is a very special and drastic power and needs to be exercised with great care and caution. It reiterated that while exercising the contempt jurisdiction, Court cannot travel beyond the four corners of the orders, alleged to be violated or read into the order what is not explicitly directed or restrained. 
"A Petitioner approaching the Court alleging contempt, cannot call upon the Court, in a contempt jurisdiction, to interpret the order differently from the manner in which it reads and only those directions which are plainly self-evident have to be taken into account to determine the violation or disobedience," the Court said. 
It added "It bears repetition to state that this Court is unable to read any explicit or even implied direction/restraint in any of the orders, referred to and relied upon by the Petitioners which restrained the Respondents from marketing, advertising the articles used in relation to their Spas."
Accordingly, the plea was dismissed.

Quashing certain provisions of the new Consumer Protection Rules, 2020 the Bombay High Court has said 10 years of experience in law and in other specialized fields is sufficient for appointment as a judicial member in the Tribunal.
 The Nagpur bench of the Bombay HC, therefore, struck down Rules 3(2)(b) and 4(2)(c) of the 2020 Rules prescribing a minimum experience of not less than 20 years for appointment of President and Members of State Commission and experience of not less than 15 years for appointment of Presidents and Members of District Forums as unconstitutional and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
The High Court referred to the Supreme Court's judgments in the series of Madras Bar Association(MBA-2020
 and MBA-2021
) cases which held that advocates with experience of 10 years should be considered for appointment as members of Tribunals.  Similarly, in State of U.P. & Ors. vs All U.P. Consumer Protection Bar Association, the Supreme Court observed that both in relation to the State Commissions and the district fora, a member must be a person of ability and standing with adequate knowledge and experience of at least 10 years in dealing with problems relating to economics, law, commerce, accountancy, industry, public affairs or administration.
 The court observed as follows:
"Thus, it is clear that the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, has repeatedly held that to have 10 years of experience in law and in other specialized fields as prescribed and stipulated under the statute, is sufficient for appointment as a judicial member in the Tribunal.The Rules 3(2)(b) and 4(2)(c) of the Rules of 2020 to the extend prescribing a minimum experience of not less than 20 years for appointment of President and Members of State Commission and experience of not less than 15 years for appointment of Presidents and Members of District Commission under the Act of 2019, is an attempt to circumvent the directions issued in MBA-2020 and UPCPBA. Hence, they are arbitrary, illegal and violates the principle of equality before law."
 Selection Committee
 Striking down provision 6(9) of the Rules that gives each state's selection committee the power to determine its own procedure to recommend names for appointment in the order of merit for the State Government to consider, the court discussed the adverse effects of not having appropriate criteria for selection and uniformity in selection.
 The petitioners had argued that although the Supreme Court approved the model rules, 2017 in UPCPBA, which included a written test, the provision was deleted in the final 2020 Rules. 
 Additionally in MBA-2020, the court said adjudicating members of consumer forums should maintain the same standards as that of what is expected from the mainstream judiciary. Only then would their order will withstand the scrutiny of the higher judiciary, the bench observed. 
 However, the Selection committee in Maharashtra had not prescribed a written test but, only a viva test. And during the pendency of the present petition and in the middle of the selection process, a decision was taken by the Selection Committee to hold written test for selection. 
 The court held this was contrary to the well-settled principle of law that in the middle of the selection process, rules for selection cannot be changed. 
 "Moreover, the decision of the Selection Committee to hold the written test, supports the case of the petitioner that looking at the judicial functions needed to be performed by the President and Members of District and State Commissions, the criteria for selection and appointment shall be applied as nearly as possible applicable to the judges in mainstream judiciary, exercising the similar powers," the bench held.

The Bombay High Court has allowed a husband's application to transfer the Domestic Violence case filed against him by his wife from a Metropolitan court to the Family court, saying that both the cases would essentially give rise to "common and connected questions."
Justice CV Bhadang
, in an order passed last week, also rejected various other contentions raised by the wife – including that her case against the husband and in-laws for not honouring the Metropolitan court's order in the DV case needed to be heard by the same court which was hearing the DV case.
On the argument that the Metropolitan court was also hearing a case for breach of its order in the DV case, therefore the DV case should not be transferred out of that court, Justice Bhadang said that the only question in the other case was whether there was a breach of the protection order passed by the Metropolitan court or not and that "except this there was no adjudication of any other dispute in the said case arising out of the matrimonial discord between the parties.
"
While the divorce petition filed by the husband is being heard by the Family court at Bandra, the wife's DV case and the case for not honouring the court's order in DV case are being heard by a Metropolitan Magistrate's court at Girgaum. The husband's lawyer Rohini Amin submitted to the court that it was inconvenient to attend two different courts for proceedings essentially arising out of the same matrimonial discord and raised similar/connected issues of law and fact. It was also argued that transfer of case is essential to avoid conflicting decisions from two different courts
The couple got married in February 2011 and were blessed with twins in September 2014. However, the marriage ran into rough weather soon thereafter and since then, the parties have filed multiple cases against each other. Significant among those cases being a case filed by the wife in February 2020 against the husband and his parents the under sections 12, 18, 19, 20, 22 and 23 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act; husband's parents' case under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act against their daughter-in-law; and husband's divorce petition against the wife in January this year.
The submissions made by the wife's counsel Surel Shah against the husband's transfer application involved – that there was no order passed which was subject matter of a challenge before the High Court for the court to exercise jurisdiction under Article 227 and that the article was meant only for Superintendence over the subordinate court's/tribunal's functioning. It was also argued that transfer, if ordered, would also result in a loss of Appellate remedy for the wife.
Justice Bhadang negated all the submissions citing precedents on all the points. The court said that it was well settled that under Article 227 of the Constitution of India the High Court exercises supervisory jurisdiction both judicial as well as administrative over the Courts and Tribunals subordinate to this Court.
Citing Santosh Machindra Mulik v. Mohini Mithu Choudhari, the court rejected the contention of "loss of a forum of appeal". It also observed that the Family court was empowered to hear a DV case as well, and transferred the case."In the DVA proceedings the Respondent No.2 is claiming that she has been subjected to Domestic Violence arising out of the matrimonial relationship. In my considered view common and connected questions would arise in both these petitions and therefore it would be appropriate if the proceedings pending before the Metropolitan Magistrate are transferred to the Family Court,

Anirudh Ajaykumar Garg v. 
State of Maharashtra

The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently set aside the order of the Disciplinary Authority against a former lower court Judge, whereby he was held guilty of misconduct. Corollary to the same, the Court also set aside the order of his compulsory retirement. He was held guilty by the Disciplinary Authority for, among other things, granting bail with "corrupt or oblique motive" and for granting adjournments on "extremely flimsy grounds".
 Disagreeing with the reasoning of the Disciplinary Authority regarding the adjournments granted by the Petitioner/Former lower court Judge, the division bench of Chief Justice Ravi Malimath and Justice Vishal Mishra observed-
 Whether the concerned Judge was justified in granting adjournments or not, cannot be ascertained by merely looking at the order sheets and the number of times, the case has been adjourned. There are so many factual situations that happen in the open Court which cannot always come about in the order sheets of the Judge. Many of the submissions, many of the requests and many such events that happen in the open Court are best left between the discussions of the Bar and the Bench. It is not necessary that each and every word that an advocate states in an open Court requires to be transcribed into the order sheets. The Judge holding a Court is not a stenographer to take down the dictation of each and every advocate.
 The case of the Petitioner was that the Authorities had proposed to hold a departmental enquiry against him, related to certain judicial orders passed by him when he was posted as an Additional District and Sessions judge. The Enquiring Officer had absolved him of the charges levelled against him, holding that the same could not be proved. The matter was then placed before the Disciplinary Authority which reversed the finding of the Enquiring Officer. Aggrieved by the said decision along with the order of his compulsory retirement, he moved the Court to challenge same.
 The Petitioner submitted before the Court that the Disciplinary Authority had erroneously reversed the findings of the Enquiring Officer based on mere inference. He also pointed out that in spite of making a request, he was not granted an opportunity of a personal hearing. He further submitted that there was no complaint against him in his entire career as a Judge of the Madhya Pradesh Judicial Services. Therefore, he argued that he was wrongly removed him from service. 
 Per contra, the Respondents submitted that the Disciplinary Authority was justified in reversing the findings of the Enquiring Officer. It was further submitted that the Petitioner being a judicial officer was expected to maintain the highest degree of honesty and integrity but had failed to do so. Therefore, the Respondents argued, they were justified in passing the impugned orders. 
 Examining the submissions of the parties and documents on record, the Court held that it was unable to reason with the findings of the Disciplinary Authority. With regard to Petitioner granting bail in violation of the provisions, the Court opined that the same may reflect upon his understanding of law rather than his corrupt intent-
 If even according to the Disciplinary Authority, the grant of bail is in violation of the mandatory provisions, the same may reflect upon the competency of the Judge in understanding the law. It cannot lead to a conclusion that he is either corrupt or the order has been passed for extraneous consideration. It is trite to mention that there are many judicial orders that may be considered to be right or may be considered to be wrong. It is not necessary that in every case where bail is granted, the same has to always be looked into with suspicious eyes that it is granted with corrupt motive or for an extraneous consideration. We do not find any logic or reason, let alone an explanation for arriving at such a conclusion. There may be a possibility that the concerned Judge has either misread the evidence or has applied it wrongly. At the most it only reflects upon his judicial competency and not that he is either corrupt or the order has been passed for extraneous consideration.
 The Court then expressed its disagreement with the conclusion of the Disciplinary Authority with regard to the allegation against the Petitioner for leniently granting adjournments. The Court opined that there are several situations brought before the courts which do not make it to their order sheets but are considered for adjournments, nevertheless-
 We do not think that the Disciplinary Authority could have recorded such a reason of finding fault with the concerned Judge for being lenient to the Bar. One really does not know as to what happens when an adjournment is sought for. It is not proper to come to a conclusion that only because an adjournment has been granted, the integrity of a Judge has to be doubted. It is a matter of fact that whenever a matter is listed, that too, for arguments, the learned counsels always seek time to either prepare themselves or for other reasons. An adjournment may be granted. Therefore, we do not think that this could be held against the concerned Judge.
 The Court did not accept the observations made by the Disciplinary Authority that by granting adjournments the Petitioner manifested 'lack of devotion'-
 The lack of devotion that has been stated by the Disciplinary Authority, if it is to be accepted on a face value, would infer that no Judge should grant any adjournment to any lawyer in any case at any point of time. Unfortunately, the stakeholders would know that this cannot be done. It is not necessary that the learned advocates seek adjournment only because they do not intend to argue the matter. On many an occasion, there are very valid grounds for which an advocate would seek an adjournment. But only because the Judge grants it, cannot be said that he lacks devotion.
 Perusing the ACRs of the Petitioner, the Court noted that his integrity was never questioned. It eas observed that his reports revealed that he enjoyed a good reputation and was touted as a good worker who was prompt in performance of his duties. Therefore, the Court held that it could not find any valid reason for the Disciplinary Authority to reverse the findings of the Enquiring Officer. 
 With the aforesaid observations, the Court set aside the impugned orders and further held that the Petitioner was entitled to 25% of the arrears of pay from the date of dismissal i.e., compulsory retirement. The Respondents were also directed to rework the Petitioner's salary, his entitlements and retiral benefits accordingly. 
 Case Title : K.C.RAJWANI v THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH LAW & LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AND ANR

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that where a company is alleged to have committed a criminal offence and is liable to be prosecuted even without impleading its Directors/persons responsible for conduct of its day to day business, upon conviction, the said company can be sentenced to punishment of fine, even though the offence for which the company has been convicted carries punishment of imprisonment as well.
 The observations were made by a bench comprising Justice Sanjay Dhar while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner, a pharma company, had challenged the complaint filed by respondent Drugs Inspector, Kathua against the petitioners and proforma respondent alleging commission of offences under Section 8(a)(i) read with Section 27 (d) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. Challenge had also been thrown to an order passed by the District Judicial Mobile Magistrate (T), Kathua whereby the Magistrate had opined that, prima facie, offences under Section 8(a)(i) read with Section 27 (d) of the Act of 1940 are made out against the accused and the process has been issued against them.
 The petitioner primarily challenged the complaint on the ground that without impleading Directors/office bearers responsible for conducting day to day business of the company, the proceedings against the said company, cannot sustain. Counsel for the petitioner also contended that the Company is a juristic person and it has to be represented by its office bearers or Directors while launching prosecution against it and in view of Section 34 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, both the company as well as the persons responsible for conducting its day to day business are the necessary parties to the proceedings. On this ground, the petitioner prayed that the prosecution against the petitioner company is liable to be quashed.
 Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Dhar observed that the perusal of Section 34 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act is amply clear that when an offence has been committed by a company, every person, who, at the time when the offence was committed, was incharge of and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company as well as the company shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence. The provision extends the concept of vicarious liability to the persons responsible for conduct of business of the company in a case where the offence has been committed by the company, the bench underscored.
 Elaborating on the mandate of the said Section the bench observed that in criminal law, there is no concept of criminal liability and it is only if there is a statute which makes a person vicariously liable for the acts of another person that such a person can be prosecuted for a criminal offence. One such example is the provision contained in Section 34 of the Drugs and Cosmetic Act whereby the persons incharge of and responsible for the conduct of business of the company are made vicariously liable for the offences committed by the company, however, the said provision makes it clear that not only those persons but even the company would be deemed to be guilty of the offence, the court said.
 Dealing with the contention of the petitioner that the expression "as well as the company" appearing in Section 34 (1) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act conveys that both the company and persons who, at the time when the offence was committed, were in charge of and were responsible to the company, have to be necessarily impleaded as the accused, the court observed that where the company is the principal offender, whereas its office bearers or Directors, responsible for conducting its day to day business, become vicariously liable for the acts of the company.
 "The expression "as well as the company" connotes that when the offence is committed by the company, it is only if the company is prosecuted, its Directors/officer bearers can be prosecuted. It can, thus, safely be inferred that the company, which is a principal offender can be prosecuted even in the absence of its Directors/persons responsible for conduct of its day to day business, but reverse is not true. Therefore, while the principal offender can be prosecuted without impleading the persons vicariously liable for its acts, the persons, who are vicariously liable for the acts of the principal offender, cannot be prosecuted without prosecuting the principal offender", the bench explained.
 Answering the question as to whether a company can be prosecuted for an offence which carries a sentence of imprisonment, besides the sentence of fine as is the case at hand the bench observed that since the company is a juristic person, as such, it is impossible to execute a sentence of imprisonment against the company. Law does not compel performing an impossibility, the court said.
 Explaining further the law on the subject the bench took recourse to a Supreme court judgement in Standard Chatered Bank and others vs. Directorate of Enforcement and others, (2005) wherein the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, while dealing with this aspect of the case, held that there is no immunity to the companies from prosecution merely because the prosecution is in respect of the offences for which punishment prescribed is mandatory imprisonment and fine.
 Summing up, the court stated that the company that is alleged to have committed a criminal offence is liable to be prosecuted even without impleading its Directors/persons responsible for conduct of its day to day business and, upon conviction, the said company can be sentenced to punishment of fine, even though the offence for which the company has been convicted carries punishment of imprisonment as well.
 Accordingly the bench did not find any merit in the petition and accordingly, dismissed the same

Sub-division of plots under the Kerala Panchayat Building Rules, does not come with such a mandate, said the Court.The Kerala High Court has ruled that a Panchayat cannot insist on the production of a development permit from an owner of a small portion of land, which is sub-divided from a large plot, to allow the construction of a residential building on his property as per Kerala Panchayat Building Rules, 2019.A Division Bench of Chief Justice S.

The Kerala High Court has ruled that a Panchayat cannot insist on the production of a development permit from an owner of a small portion of land, which is sub-divided from a large plot, to allow the construction of a residential building on his property as per Kerala Panchayat Building Rules, 2019.
A Division Bench of Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly held that the Rules contemplate an entirely different situation from the purchase of a small plot of land by an individual from a larger area, whether the owner of the property had divided it into various plots and sold it or not.
"...the writ petitioner, an owner of a small extent of property not having the power or authority to seek a development permit for the entire property belonging to some other persons, cannot be compelled to secure a development permit for carrying out the construction of a residential building in his property. Moreover, merely because a larger area is divided into 56 plots and provided roads for ingress and egress to the purchasers, the Secretary of the Panchayat is not empowered under the Rules,2019 to insist on a development permit."
Upon purchasing some dry land for constructing a residential building, the petitioner filed an application for a building permit before the Grama Panchayat Secretary, but he was asked to produce the plot development permit for considering his application.
According to the petitioner, since he does not intend to develop the land further in contemplation of the Rules, there is no requirement for a plot development permit.
The Single Judge agreed with this submission based on the decision in Nafeesa v. Chavakkad Municipality [2018(3) KLT 1] held that a purchaser of a small plot from a large extent of property is not liable to secure any land development permit under the Rules. 
Challenging the legality of this judgment, the Panchayat and its Secretary moved an appeal. 
 Advocate P.C.Sasidharan appearing for the appellants argued that whenever there is a subdivision of a plot, a development permit has to be secured from the Secretary as per Rules 2(ae), 4, 5, and 31.
It was further submitted that merely because a developer who subdivided the property and sold it has not secured a development permit before the sale of the plot, that will not disable the Panchayat to insist on the development permit before granting a building permit to the applicant.
Advocates Lindons C.Davis and Swathy A.P appeared for the petitioner and resisted the appeal. 
The Court took the view that the development and redevelopment of land and sub-division of plots should be read together with Rules 2(ad) and 2(ae) that define developer and development of land.
"Therefore, on a conjoint reading of the aforesaid provisions, it is clear that the development permit in contemplation of the rules is required when the activities as envisaged under the definitions of "developer and development of land" takes place."
The development or redevelopment of any parcel of land by subdividing into plots is an integrated activity by the developer in contemplation of the development of land, it said. 
It was further found that Rule 31 only deals with a situation where a specified area is required for a divided plot to carry out the construction of any residential building and the requirements contained thereunder are applicable when the plot is developed in accordance with Rule 2(ae).
As such, the Bench held that the Single Judge was right in following the judgement in Nafeesa (supra). Thererefore, it was found that the appellants had failed to make out a case of jurisdictional error or other legal infirmities, justifying our interference in the judgement. 
The appeal was accordingly dismissed. However, since the time period granted by the Single Judge for consideration of the application had already expired, it was extended for three weeks.

The Allahabad High Court has recently observed that the Members of the Bar are free to hold a meeting to condole the demise of any member or anyone else, but they do not have the right to obstruct the functioning of Courts.
The Bench of Justice J. J. Munir observed this while dealing with the affidavits filed before it by the President and the Secretary of Commissioner Court's Bar Association, Ayodhya tendering their unconditional apology for the repeated strikes.
Essentially, due to the repeated strikes, the proceedings in a case pending before Additional Commissioner, Faizabad (First) Ayodhya Division, Ayodhya could not see any progress and when that very matter was brought to the notice of the Court, it had earlier called for a report from the Commissioner in the matter.
On December 17, 2021, the Court perused a report filed by Additional Commissioner, Faizabad (First) Ayodhya Division, Ayodhya in compliance with the court's order highlighting the dates on which the case at hand could not be taken up by the Commissioner because of the strikes called by members of the Bar.
Court's December 17 observations
Persuing the Commissioner's report, the Court had noted that the Faizabad Bar Association and the Commissioner Court's Bar Association had virtually brought the functioning of the Commissioner's Court to a standstill as they were indulging in rampant and repeat strikes.
The Court also took note of the fact that earlier some affidavits were filed by the former Presidents and the Secretaries of the Faizabad Bar Association and the Commissioner Court's Bar Association, undertaking that they will not abstain from judicial work, except under some extraordinary circumstances.
However, the Court noted that in breach of the said undertaking, the two office-bearers were indulging in repeat and rampant adoption of resolutions, asking the Members of the Bar to abstain from judicial work and therefore, the Court, on December 17, sought the affidavits of the President and the Secretary, Commissioner Court's Bar Association.
On December 23, filing the required affidavits, the President, Commissioner Court's Bar Association, and the Secretary appeared before the Court through their counsels and tendered their unconditional apology.
The said Affidavits assured the Court that no resolution abstaining from work shall be passed by the Association except for any grave situation and that all possible efforts shall be made and full support shall be extended by the Association to ensure proper and uninterrupted functioning of the Court.
Court's observations made on December 23
At the outset, noting that apology given by the President and the Secretary of the Bar Association was 'qualified', the Court said that as per Supreme Court Order in District Bar Association, Dehradun through its Secretary Vs. Ishwar Shandilya and Others, AIR 2020 SC 1412, no kind of freedom or right entitle a Bar Association to give a call for any kind of strike or boycott of Courts.
Therefore, the Court accepted the apology without any qualifications and ordered that until further orders, the Commissioner's Court Bar Association, Ayodhya, shall not pass any resolution, abstaining from judicial work, whether styled as a strike or a call to abstain from judicial work, a condolence resolution that has the effect of withdrawing Advocates from judicial work, by whatever name called. 
"The Members of the Bar are free to hold a meeting to condole the demise of any member or anyone else, but they do not have the right to obstruct the functioning of Courts. The undertaking given today, on the basis of which this order is passed, shall not only apply to the incumbent President and Secretary of the Commissioner's Court Bar Association, Ayodhya but to all their successors-in-Office," the Court further added.
So far as the present petition was concerned, the Court directed that the Additional Commissioner Faizabad (First), Ayodhya Division Ayodhya, shall proceed with the case in question on a day-to-day basis and submit a status report also by the next date fixed. 
Lastly, the Court ordered that the petition be listed again as fresh on January 28, 2022 by which time, the Commissioner, Ayodhya Division Ayodhya, shall submit a report to this Court indicating whether any resolution obstructing the judicial work or withdrawing the Members of the Bar from their professional duties has been passed by the Bar Association.

While reiterating that the right to promotion is not a Fundamental Right, the Gauhati High Court has recently dismissed a petition filed by a Graduate Teacher challenging the vires of Rule 14(2) of the Assam Secondary Education (Provincialisation) Service Rules, 2003 on grounds that she was not promoted to the position of the headmistress. A division bench of Chief Justice...
While reiterating that the right to promotion is not a Fundamental Right, the Gauhati High Court has recently dismissed a petition filed by a Graduate Teacher challenging the vires of Rule 14(2) of the Assam Secondary Education (Provincialisation) Service Rules, 2003 on grounds that she was not promoted to the position of the headmistress.
 A division bench of Chief Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia and Justice Soumitra Saikia relied on a judgement passed by the co-ordinate bench in Kripa Sindhu Das Vs. State of Assam & Ors it was held :
 "The right to be considered for promotion is a fundamental right, while the right to promotion is (not) fundamental right. It was held that the right of the Assistant Head Master to be promoted to the post of Head Master is not denied or diminished as he still can be promoted to the post of Head Master by taking into account his seniority in the cadre of Graduate Teacher and therefore his chance of getting promoted to the post of Head Master is not lost."
 The Bench after carefully perusing the said decision noted that the issue raised in this case had already been specifically dealt with and declared that it was in complete agreement with the views arrived at by the Co-ordinate Bench. 
It was also noted that no averments or submissions were made by the parties herein that the cited decision required reconsideration either. Accordingly, finding no reasons to take a different view in the present proceedings, the plea was dismissed. 
The petitioner was initially appointed as a Graduate Teacher in C.S. Rawanapur Higher Secondary School in 12.10.1988 issued by the Inspector of Schools, Jorhat District Circle. By order dated 16.06.1994 issued by the Director of Secondary Education, Assam, she was transferred to Sarojini Devi Uccha Balika Bidyalaya. 
She was also appointed as In-charge, Headmistress of that school on 26.04.2016 by the Director of Secondary Education upon the post falling vacant due to the retirement of the previous incumbent. Later she was promoted to the position of Assistant Headmistress while she continued to also discharge her services as the In-charge, Headmistress of the said school since 01.05.2016.
 Meanwhile, the Department of Secondary Education, Government of Assam advertised the post of Headmaster along with other posts lying vacant including those which were likely to fall vacant by 31.12.2017. In response to the said advertisement, the petitioner as well as respondent No. 5 applied for the post of Headmistress of Sarojini Devi Ucchal Balika Bidyalaya. 
However, respondent No. 5 was selected for the post of Headmistress in Sarojini Devi. 
 Being aggrieved, the petitioner moved the Court challenging the validity of Rule 14(2) of the Assam Secondary Education (Provincialisation) Service Rules while praying for consequential order for setting aside the impugned selection.
 The Petitioner argued that under the Rules, the post of Headmaster is included in the cadre of Class-II (Senior) and the post of Assistant Headmaster is included in the cadre Class-II (Junior) under the Rules. The post of Graduate Teacher is also included in the cadre of Class-II (Junior). It was submitted that the provisions for recruitment to the post of Headmaster/ Assistant Headmaster are prescribed under Rule 14 of the Rules of 2003.
 He strenuously submitted that although under Rule 14(2), it is prescribed that the post of Headmaster shall be filled upon by promotion from school wise seniority list on the recommendation of the State Selection Board, Assam and the selection of the incumbent shall be based upon seniority and satisfactory ACR for the three (3) consecutive years, but it is also provided that the seniority shall be determined from the date of receiving the Graduate Scale as per Rule 24(2). 
 The counsel for the petitioner submitted that it is this provision for deciding the seniority on the basis of receiving the Graduate Scale which is opposed to the scheme of the Rules and more particularly the class and cadre specified under the Rules. 
 He argued that to the extent the Rule provides for deciding the seniority on the basis of receipt of Graduate Scale of Pay as per Rule 24(2), the instant Rule i.e. Rule 14(2) is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India as it has the effect of treating two different posts in the cadre to be equal for the purposes of being feeder posts for promotion to the post of Head Master of the School. 
 According to the counsel for the petitioner, respondent No. 5 was not eligible for the selection to the post of Head Master for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016 as she did not fulfil the eligibility criteria because she did not acquire the requisite qualification of B.Ed Degree. On the contrary, the petitioner had all the requisite qualifications. She was a Master's Degree Holder as well as a B.Ed Degree holder and consequently she was selected for promotion to the post of Assistant Headmistress in the year 2017.
 The Government Advocate argued that the matter in respect of the vires of Rule 14(2) had already been dealt with by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Kripa Sindhu Das Vs. State of Assam & Ors. Further, he submitted that the validity of the section has already been upheld.
 The same was confirmed by the counsel for respondent number 5, who was appointed as headmistress.
 The Court went through the relevant judgement passed by the coordinate bench and noted that the Co-ordinate Bench held that as the Rules permit, there is no infirmity in taking School-wise seniority in the cadre of Graduate Teacher as the basis for considering the inter se seniority and also for the purposes of considering the incumbents in the feeder cadre for promotion to the next higher post.
 It also agreed with the observations of the coordinate bench and dismissed the present matter noting that it finds no merit in the contentions of the petitioner.
 Petitioner was represented by advocate I.H. Saikia and respondent was represented by advocates P. Chakraborty, P. Sharma and P. Bora
 Case Title: Smti. Protiva Devi v State of Assam & Ors.

A Delhi Court on Monday sentenced two Hizb-ul Mujahideen members namely Mohd. Shafi Shah and Muzzafar Ahmad Dar to 12 years imprisonment while sentencing the other two men namely Talib Lali and Mushtaq Ahmad Lone to 10 years imprisonment for terror funding and waging war against the Government of India.

A Delhi Court on Monday sentenced two Hizb-ul Mujahideen members namely Mohd. Shafi Shah and Muzzafar Ahmad Dar to 12 years imprisonment while sentencing the other two men namely Talib Lali and Mushtaq Ahmad Lone to 10 years imprisonment for terror funding and waging war against the Government of India. 
Additional Sessions Judge Parveen Singh passed the order on sentence after the four were convicted under various provisions of IPC as well as UAPA. 
The case was lodged with allegations that Hizb-ul- Mujahideen (HM) had been regularly receiving funds originating from neighbouring countries for carrying out terrorist activities in India and that in the  garb of an organization namely, Jammu Kashmir Affectees Relief Trust (JKART), the said terrorist outfit was actively involved in furthering the terrorist activities in India.
Perusing the socio economic reports of the convicts, the Court opined thus:
"I find that the hand which provides the gun or the motivation to take up the gun is equally liable as the hand which ultimately fires that gun. The convicts, in this case, may not have been charged and convicted for any direct terror act leading to loss of life or property however, the proxy war in the State of J&K which has been raging since decades has resulted in loss of numerous lives and destruction of State property."
It was also observed that the convicts who were convicted for terror financing provided funds for the activities of HM which were used for the destruction of property and taking human lives.
"Thus, merely because, in the present case, the convicts were not directly responsible for loss of life and property, it cannot be accepted that they were not responsible for loss of life and destruction of property because of the terrorist activities of HM. On the contrary, I find that the funding network run by these convicts on the instructions of their handlers sitting in Pakistan had a greater responsibility for the terror acts committed by HM as in absence of such funding, which financed the cadres of HM and provided logistic support, it would not have been possible to commit those terror activities," the Court said. 
The Court was also of the view that the crimes for which the convicts were convicted were of very serious nature as they had hatched a conspiracy to strike at the core of the nation and actions were taken to execute that conspiracy.
Accordingly, while sentencing the four, the Court ordered that all the sentences shall run concurrently. 
"Benefit of section 428 Cr.P.C shall be given to the convict," it added. 
Title: NIA v. Mohammad Shafi Shah & Ors. 

The Gujarat High Court has dismissed a petition filed by Anganwadi workers alleging that they were not promoted to the post of 'Mukhya Sevika' on account of discrimination between those working at the District Panchayat level and those working under the Municipal Corporation.

The Gujarat High Court has dismissed a petition filed by Anganwadi workers alleging that they were not promoted to the post of 'Mukhya Sevika' on account of discrimination between those working at the District Panchayat level and those working under the Municipal Corporation. 
It was alleged that Anganwadi Workers from District Panchayats were elevated to the aforesaid post while those from the Municipal Corporation were deemed ineligible. 
However, the Bench comprising Justice AY Kogje observed:
 "The Court does not find any discriminatory clause in the policy however, considering the argument of learned advocate for the petitioners that the Anganwadi Workers, who were working under the District Development Officer were given priority and they stole the march over the petitioners for the promotion to the post of the Mukhya Sevika, in the opinion of the Court, would be attributable to the procedure which is undertaken by two separate establishments, depending upon the exigency which existed there, but such cannot be the ground to decide that the resolution was itself discriminatory in any manner."
 The Court also noted that whereas the policy for promotions was framed in the year 2005 and relaxation in age for first round of promotions was announced in the year 2007, the actual procedure for effecting promotions only commenced in the year 2011, by which time the Petitioners had superannuated.
In this backdrop, the Court clarified,
"Date on which the resolutions are framed, cannot be treated to be the date relevant for the purpose of deciding the entitlement of the petitioners. The relevant date to decide the entitlement would be the procedure that would be undertaken for the purpose of promotion which in the present case, is in the year 2011 for the first time and therefore, the age of the petitioners on the date on which the promotions are to be considered is relevant."
Petitioners assailed the impugned Government Resolution which framed the policy of promotion by claiming that it was arbitrary and discriminatory and violative of Art 14. Additionally, the Petitioners had corresponded with the authorities for long but no action was taken. Reliance was placed on Smt. Manjulaben M. Ranavat Anganwadi Worker v/s. District Development Office to submit that in an identical situation of the Anganwadi Worker, she was given the post of Mukhya Sevika. Basis their age (45 years or 48 years), they were entitled to the promotion, as well.
 The Municipal Corporation opposed the submission on the ground that the age of the Petitioners had surpassed 48 years. Therefore, their names did not appear in the list of selected candidates. 
 The Bench admitted that the upper age limit was fixed at 48 years while referring to the Government Resolution of 2007, even as the Petitioners were above that age. In fact, at the time of filing the instant application, the Petitioner was 55 years of age in 2017. Reliance on Manjulaben  was dismissed by the Bench on the ground that the case involved a discrepancy in the date of birth of the Anganwadi Worker. Addressing the contention regarding violation of Art 14, the High Court could not find any discriminatory clause. 
 Lastly, the High Court rejected the argument of the Petitioner that their eligibility cannot be adjudicated from the date on which the Resolutions were framed (2005 and 2007). The High Court explained that the entitlement of the Petitioners for the promotion would be determined from the year 2011 when the procedure for promotion was first decided.
 Accordingly, the petition was dismissed.

Considering the predicament of lower-income young practising advocates, Madras High Court has tabled a proposition to frame a scheme for allotment of houses in public quota on a rental basis for them.
Justice Krishnan Ramasamy has directed the Tamil Nadu Housing Board and State Government to frame the scheme in consultation with TN & Puducherry Bar Council by giving preference to the practising young advocates until the prescribed age, in reserving a certain percentage of residential accomodations in public quota. An alternative would be taking the financial status of the concerned advocate into account and giving them residential accommodation for a limited number of years on a rental basis, the court opined.
"...Though the lawyers are viewed in society as highly competent and capable, but low in warmth and trustworthiness. Nowadays, many of the young Advocates, though they have mastered their degree in law, are facing many difficulties in society since they are in the irregular income group in their initial stage of practice, facing difficulties to meet out their financial needs and to make out their livelihood...", the court noted before giving directions.
Banks and Landlords alike are indifferent to the requests of the advocates when it comes to loans and renting property respectively, the court further opined.
On the question of whether advocates can be allotted residential accommodation under the public quota, the court relied on the Madras HC judgment in T. Sornapandian & Others v. The Principal Secretary to Government, Housing & Urban Development (HB(2) HB5(2)) Department, Chennai & Others (2019).
Relying on the said judgment, the court remarked that there is no hard and fast rule about to whom the residential accommodation should be allotted under 'public quota'.
"In such circumstances, it has to be construed that a person who renders service to the public, is certainly entitled to the residential accommodation under public quota", the single bench further added.
Noting that an advocate is an officer of the court, Justice Krishnan Ramsamy also mentioned that the services rendered by young practising advocates in assisting the court, serving the litigant public and dispensing justice are instrumental. 
"The Advocate's duty is as important as that of a Judge and they play a vital role in the preservation of the justice system and since the duty of a lawyer is to assist the Court in the administration of justice, the practice of law has a public utility flavor", the court added.
The court issued the said direction while hearing a writ petition filed by a former President of District Consumer Redressal Forum who has also completed 35 years of practice as an advocate. The court lamented about the petitioner not being able to own a house even at the age of sixty despite his service and applying for allotment of residential accommodation under public quota which was initially rejected.
Taking note of the same, the court has also directed the respondents to consider the petitioner's representation on merits and take a decision within eight weeks.
"Though 'public quota' is shown as a distinct quota, it essentially forms part of the Government quota, as 20% of the accommodation made available by the Government is carved out to be allotted under the 'public quota'. The claim of the petitioner has to be considered under public quota...", the court added by mentioning the post held by the petitioner and the service he rendered as a practising advocate.
Therefore, the court opined that the petitioner is entitled to seek residential accommodation on a rental basis in public quota.
Previously, the respondents had argued that the petitioner is well off without any allotment under public quota since he is a practising advocate for many years and his wife had also retired from service in 2017 as a nurse.

The Madras High Court recently directed the Thoothukudi District Collector and police authorities to strictly implement a Circular Memorandum regarding procedure to be followed while granting permission to conduct cultural events, sports events, procession/meeting etc. The authorities were thus to ensure that no obscene or vulgar dance performance or other procession takes place during the Dasara festival in the Arultharum Mutharamman temple.
 We direct that the obscene and vulgar dance performance should be specifically prohibited by the Police authorities in the forthcoming festival and if any one violates the same, appropriate action shall be taken against them in line with the above said Circular Memorandum. 
 The bench of Justice R Mahadevan and Justice Sathya Narayana Prasad were hearing a petition filed by one Ramkumar Adityan to direct the police authorities to obtain a declaration from the organisers of all Dasara Groups and Sound Hire Service Providers not to sing and play any non Devotional Songs and Kuthu Pattu during Dasara festival in connection to the festival of Arultharum Mutharamman Thirukovil, Kulasekarapattinam, Thoothukudi District. By doing so, the petitioner sought to stop vulgar and obscene dance performances in the name of Dasara Groups and to protect the Traditional Culture, Traditional Viradham System and Religious sentiments of lakhs of Devotees. 
 The petitioner submitted that though initially the Dasara Festival was associated with processions and folk music and dance, now these Dasara groups started hiring cine/television actors who without observing any virudham would perform obscene and vulgar dance performances. 
 The court perused through the photographs produced by the petitioner and was convinced that the same made a mockery of the traditional culture. 
 While photographs from page Nos.22 to 27 relating to Dasara celebration in other places in India show traditional culture and customs, photographs from pages 28 to 37 relating to devotees who are observing viradham and watching dances at Kulasekaranpatinam Dasara celebration, conspicuously show that such dances are performed by paid dancers exhibiting obscene and vulgar postures making mockery of the traditional culture and customs to be followed in Dasara festival and denigrating the Hindu religious sentiments.
 The Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that pursuant to the orders of the court, the Director General of Police had issued a circular memorandum in 2018 to all Commissioners of Police in Cities and all the Superintendent of Police in Districts, instructing them to ensure compliance with the orders of the court.
 The Inspectors were further directed to obtain an undertaking from the organisers that there will not be any obscenity or vulgarity in the cultural programs or any disturbance to the public peace and tranquility. In case any violation was noticed, the authorities were directed to take stringent/criminal action against those concerned.
 Later, in 2019 another circular was issued with consolidated instructions with regard to the procedures to be followed while granting permission to conduct cultural events,sports events, procession/meeting etc. The AAG assured the court that these circulars will be followed in letter and spirit during the current Dasara festival also. 
 In view of such submission by the AAG, the court disposed of the petition directing the authorities to strictly follow the memorandum and the directives of the court.

While upholding the delimitation exercise in Jammu and Kashmir, the Supreme Court observed that the Parliament has the power to convert an existing state into a Union Territory.
A bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Abhay S Oka noted that Article 3 provides that Parliament may by law form new States and alter the areas, boundaries or names of the existing States. As per, explanation I of Article 3, a “State” includes “Union Territory”.
"Thus, Explanation I makes it amply clear that the power of Parliament under Clause (a) of Article 3, to make a law to form a new State or to alter a boundary of a State includes a power to make a law to form a new Union Territory", the judgment observed. Explanation II to Article 3 states that the power conferred on Parliament by clause (a) includes the power to form a new State or Union territory by uniting a part of any State or Union territory to any other State or Union territory.
On a conjoint reading of Articles 3,4 and 239A, the Court found that "Parliament by making a law can convert an existing State into one or more Union territories".
The bench was deciding a petition filed challenging the validity of Union's decision of constituting a Delimitation Commission for the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir under provisions of the Delimitation Act, 2002 and the exercise of delimitation undertaken by the Commission. 
In August 2019, the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 was abrogated.On 31.10.2019, the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which provided for reorganisation of the State of Jammu and Kashmir by dividing it into two Union Territories came into force. A new Union Territory of Ladakh was also created.
Section 13 of the Reorganisation Act, 2019 makes Article 239A, which confers power on the Parliament to enact a law for creating a legislature for the Union Territory, applicable to the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir. By virtue of Section 62 of the Reorganisation Act, 2019, the Delimitation Act, 2002 was made applicable to the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir.
The petitioners' case was mainly based on Article 170 (3) of the Constitution of India that freezes delimitation exercise till the first census after 2026. However, the Supreme Court held that Article 170(3) is not applicable to a Union Territory, which J&K at present is. The said provision does not provide for any such freezing period.
The judgment has clarified that the dismissal of the petition should not be construed as giving imprimatur to the decisions taken in relation to Article 370 as the said issue is pending before a Constitution Bench.

The Madras High Court has recently dismissed a batch of pleas challenging the premature release of 13 convicts who were convicted in the infamous Melavalavu Massacre.
 The Melavalavu Massacre was a caste-based violence where a group of men murdered seven people including the Village Panchayat President and Vice-President as they refused to accept a person from the Dalit Community as their village head. 40 men were arrested — the trial court acquitted 23 and convicted 17 for offences under Section 302 r/w 34 IPC and sentenced them to life imprisonment. The conviction was upheld by the High Court and the Supreme Court. 
 Of the 17 convicted, one died in prison and three were released prematurely in 2008. To commemorate the Birth Centenary of former Chief Minister MG Ramachandran, the State framed a scheme for considering the cases of premature release of convicted prisoners who have completed 10 years of imprisonment. The State government thus decided to give amnesty to these life convicts in 2019.
 While refusing to interfere with the order of the Government, the division bench of Justice G Jayachandran and Justice Sunder Mohan of the Madurai Bench noted that the order of premature release was made after due consideration exercising the State's power conferred under Article 161 of the Constitution. It included objections from the victim’s family and the conduct of the accused.
 "In the instant case, we find the impugned order of premature release been issued after due consideration of facts relevant. It includes the objections from the side of victims and the conduct of the prisoners during the parole and in prison, the law and order situation prevailing in the Village after three out of 17 convicts released prematurely earlier, the parity between those three convicts and the remaining 13 convicts (one died due to illness)."
 The petitioners had challenged the premature release by submitting that one of the convicts was previously convicted of committing the double murder of members belonging to the Schedule Caste community which disentitled him to get the benefit of remission. 
The State had also failed to take into account the fact that the villager was prone to caste discrimination and leaching violence against SC members, it was argued. 
"Numerous cases registered under the SC & ST (POA) Act, 1989 in the Melavalvu Police Station in the past would show that the premature release of these convicts is not conducive for the peace, tranquillity and safety of the oppressed class. Without considering the safety of the victims family, the State has exercised its power to release them prematurely without application of mind," it was contended. 
 The petitioners also submitted that even though the convicts were acquitted under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, a division bench of the High Court had, while upholding the conviction, said that there was enough material to hold them guilty. 
 The State, however, submitted that the decision for premature release was made after following due procedure and taking into consideration all the relevant factors. Further, with respect to one of the convicts charged with double murder, the State submitted that he was acquitted under the SC & ST (POA) Act. 
 The court noted that the State had considered all relevant factors while granting premature release. 
 "It is further reported by the learned Additional Public Prosecutor through the status report that there is no law and order problem either when the prisoners were released on parole on various occasions and also after their premature release. This justifies the discretion of the State exercising its prerogative power applying mind considering all relevant materials."
 Thus, the court refused to interfere with the order and dismissed the petitions.
 Case Title: P Rathinam v. State of Tamil Nadu and others

The Madras High Court recently observed that in matters of public employments, equal opportunities should be granted. Whenever a decision is taken with respect to recruitment, the competent authorities are bound to follow the recruitment rules in force by providing equal opportunities to all candidate. However, the court also observed that appointments can never be claimed as a matter of absolute right.
 Justice SM Subramaniam was dealing with a batch of writ petitions filed by persons who took part in the process of selection for appointment to the post of Field Assistant (Trainee) in 2016. 
 The petitioners were not appointed as they did not fall within the zone of consideration. Subsequently, Thousands of vacancies arose for the post but the respondents did not take any action to fill up the vacancies by providing an opportunity to the persons who have participated in the selection during the year 2016.
 The petitioners argued that the respondent- Tamil Nadu Electricity Generation & Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) utilized persons appointed as Gangmen to perform the duties of the Field Assistant and that this has resulted in a lot of accidents as the Gangmen are not qualified to perform the duties in live electric wires. They thus claimed that the action of the respondent is not condonable and that they are bound to consider all the candidate for appointment to the post of Field Assistants.
 The respondents on the other hand opposed these contentions by stating that the petitioners were not considered for appointment as they did not fall within the zone of consideration and that 900 candidates were selected and appointed in the same recruitment process. Further in 2020, a notification was issued for filing up 2900 vacancies in the post of Field Assistant. However, the same was discontinued on account of Covid-19 situation. 
 The respondents further informed that recently the government enacted the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (Additional Functions) Act 2022 (Act 14 of 2022) according to which the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission was given authority to recruit candidates for appointment to the post of Field Assistant. Thus, the power to recruit was now with the Commission. The respondents also submitted that the writ petitions are liable to be rejected in view of the fact that they were filed after a lapse of six years challenging the appointments in 2016.
 The court agreed with this contention of the respondents. It observed that a direction could not be made to the respondents to appoint petitioners as Field Assistants and that too after a lapse of six years. It also held that the writ petitioners have not established any right for the purpose of granting the relief of appointment to the post of Field Assistant, as appointments are to be made in accordance with the recruitment rules in force.
 The court also observed that if seen that the Gangmen were utilized to perform the duties of wiremen, electricians etc, the public institutions were expected to act in accordance with law. The court also observed that the petitioners were at liberty to participate in the recruitment process if any notification was issued to such extend.

The Supreme Court has observed that  mere possession or recovery of currency notes is not sufficient to constitute an offence under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
To prove the charge, it has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt that accused voluntarily accepted money knowing it to be bribe, the bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan, R. Subhash Reddy and MR Shah observed while setting aside a High Court judgment which convicted an accused in a corruption case.
In this case, the accused, who was a Sanitary Inspector of Madurai Municipal Corporation, was acquitted in a corruption case by the Trial Court. The High Court, allowing the appeal filed by the State, reversed the Trial Court judgment and convicted the accused.
In appeal, taking note of the evidence on record, the bench observed that the demand for and acceptance of bribe amount and cell phone by the appellant, is not proved beyond reasonable doubt. The Court observed:
"It is equally well settled that mere recovery by itself cannot prove the charge of the prosecution against the accused. Reference can be made to the judgments of this Court in the case of C.M. Girish Babu v. CBI, Cochin, High Court of Kerala (2009) 3 SCC 779 and in the case of B. Jayaraj v. State of Andhra Pradesh (2014) 13 SCC 55. In the aforesaid judgments of this Court while considering the case under Sections 7, 13(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 it is reiterated that to prove the charge, it has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt that accused voluntarily accepted money knowing it to be bribe. Absence of proof of demand for illegal gratification and mere possession or recovery of currency notes is not sufficient to constitute such offence. In the said judgments it is also held that even the presumption under Section 20 of the Act can be drawn only after demand for and acceptance of illegal gratification is proved. It is also fairly well settled that initial presumption of innocence in the criminal jurisprudence gets doubled by acquittal recorded by the trial court. "
The court also noted that, in this case, the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court is a "possible view" and therefore the High Court ought not to have reversed the acquittal to that of the conviction. The bench observed:
"if the "possible view" of the trial court is not agreeable for the High Court, even then such "possible view" recorded by the trial court cannot be interdicted. It is further held that so long as the view of trial court can be reasonably formed, regardless of whether the High Court agrees with the same or not, verdict of trial court cannot be interdicted and the High court cannot supplant over the view of the trial court" 
While setting aside the High Court judgment, the bench observed:
"In view of the contradictions noticed by us above in the depositions of key witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution, we are of the view that the demand for and acceptance of bribe amount and cell phone by the appellant, is not proved beyond reasonable doubt. Having regard to such evidence on record the acquittal recorded by the trial court is a "possible view" as such the judgment of the High Court is fit to be set aside. Before recording conviction under the provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, courts have to take utmost care in scanning the evidence. Once conviction is recorded under provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, it casts a social stigma on the person in the society apart from serious consequences on the service rendered. At the same time it is also to be noted that whether the view taken by the trial court is a possible view or not, there cannot be any definite proposition and each case has to be judged on its own merits, having regard to evidence on record."
CASE: N.Vijayakumar vs. State of Tamil Nadu [CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS. 100­101 OF 2021] CORAM: Justices Ashok Bhushan, R. Subhash Reddy and MR ShahCOUNSEL: Sr. Adv S. Nagamuthu, Adv M. Yogesh KannaCITATION: LL 2021 SC 59
Read Judgment

The Supreme Court has observed that a defendant cannot enjoy the property during pendency of suit without depositing the amount of rent/damages by merely denying the relationship of landlord- tenant/lessor-lessee.
 "In the context of the proposition of denial of title of the plaintiff and denial of relationship of landlord and tenant between the plaintiff and defendant, we may also observe that such a denial simpliciter does not and cannot absolve the lessee/tenant to deposit the due amount of rent/damages for use and occupation, unless he could show having made such payment in a lawful and bonafide manner. Of course, the question of bonafide is a question of fact, to be determined in every case with reference to its facts but, it cannot be laid down as a general proposition that by merely denying the title of plaintiff or relationship of landlord- tenant/lessor-lessee, a defendant of the suit of the present nature could enjoy the property during the pendency of the suit without depositing the amount of rent/damages, the bench of Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Aniruddha Bose observed while allowing the appeal.
The Court was deciding the applicability of Order XV Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure in the case. As per this provision, the the defence of the defendent in an eviction suit can be struck off on if there is default in depositing the rent dues.
 The court also opined that Order XV Rule 5 CPC embodies the fundamental principle that there is no "holidaying for a tenant in payment of rent or damages for use and occupation, whether the lease is subsisting or it has been determined".
 "The only basic requirement in the suit of the nature envisaged by Order XV Rule 5 CPC is the character of defendant as being the lessee/tenant in the suit premises," Court further added.
 In the present matter the plaintiff had filed a suit before the Trial Court averring that she was the owner of a shop as she had purchased the registered sale deed from the erstwhile owner. She also stated in the suit that the defendant who was a chronic defaulter in payment of rent and taxes was a tenant in the shop. 
Denying the relationship of landlord and tenant, the defendant asserted in his written statement that the alleged sale deed was illegal and void. Praying for striking off the defendant's statement, the plaintiff had preferred an application under Order XV Rule 5, CPC on the ground that the defendant had not deposited any rent and had not adduced any evidence to establish payment of any rent. The application was contested by the defendant on the ground that the provisions invoked were only applicable to a case where the defendant accepted plaintiff as his landlord. The defence was struck off by the Trial Court by observing that no evidence was placed on record by the defendant to show his payment of rent to the plaintiff and observed that even if the tenant would deny the relationship of landlord and tenant, the application under Order XV Rule 5 CPC was maintainable.
 Since the ADJ upheld the view taken by the single judge, the defendant approached the High Court. The High Court while allowing defendant's application, set aside the orders impugned before it, directed the defendant to deposit the arrears of rent together with interest within one month and f to deposit the current rent as determined by the Trial Court, month by month, by seventh of every month during the pendency of litigation.
 Aggrieved by the High Court's order, the plaintiff approached the Top Court. Counsel for the appellant urged that only he High Court has misinterpreted and misapplied the provisions of Order XV Rule 5 CPC and has allowed the petition filed by the defendant by merely holding that he was entitled to some indulgence but, without giving any specific reason or finding to overturn the considered orders passed by the subordinate Courts. Referring to the provisions contained in Order XV Rule 5 CPC, Counsel submitted that as per the said provisions, the defendant-respondent, being the tenant of the suit shop, was required to pay or deposit the entire rent for use and occupation of the shop in question but, he neither paid nor deposited the due amount on the first hearing.
 Relying on the law laid down in Bimal Chand Jain v. Sri Gopal Agarwal: 1981 (3) SCC 486 and Manik Lal Majumdar and Ors. v. Gouranga Chandra Dey and Ors.: AIR 2005 SC 1090, the respondent's counsel submitted that when he had taken specific plea regarding non-existence of relationship of landlord and tenant, he was not liable to deposit any rent in terms of the Order XV Rule 5 CPC.
 To adjudicate on the issue as to whether the High Court was right in reversing the order striking off defence in terms of Order XV Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the bench referred to few basic factors related with the provisions of Order XV Rule 5 CPC could be noticed at once.
 "As per these provisions, in a suit by a lessor for eviction of a lessee after the determination of lease and for recovery of rent or compensation for use and occupation, the defendant is under the obligation: (1) to deposit the entire amount admitted by him to be due together with interest at the rate of 9% per annum on or before the first hearing of the suit; and (2) to regularly deposit the monthly amount due within a week of its accrual throughout the pendency of the suit. The consequence of default in making either of these deposits is that the Court may strike off his defence. The expression 'first hearing' means the date for filing written statement or the date for hearing mentioned in the summons; and in case of multiple dates, the last of them. The expression 'monthly amount due' means the amount due every month, whether as rent or damages for use and occupation at the admitted rate of rent after making no other deduction except taxes, if paid to the local authority on lessor's account. It is, however, expected that before making an order striking off defence, the Court would consider the representation of the defendant, if made within 10 days of the first hearing or within 10 days of the expiry of one week from the date of accrual of monthly amount," Court said.
 Disapproving the view by the High Court, the bench said, "With respect, the said conclusion of the High Court could only be said to be an assumptive one, being not supported by any reason. In paragraph 44, of course, the High Court observed with reference to the decisions of this Court that the discretionary power must be exercised with great circumspection but, such enunciation by this Court cannot be read to mean that whatever may be the fault and want of bonafide in the defendant/tenant, he would be readily given the so-called 'indulgence' of not striking off defence. Such an approach is neither envisaged by the statutory provisions nor by the referred decisions. In fact, such an approach would simply render the relevant provisions of law rather nugatory. The expected circumspection would require the Court to be cautious of all the relevant facts and the material on record and not to strike off the defence as a matter of routine."
 Case Title: Asha Rani Gupta v Sir Vineet Kumar| Civil Appeal 4682 of 2022
Code of Civil Procedure 1908 - Order XV Rule 5 - it cannot be laid down as a general proposition that by merely denying the title of plaintiff or relationship of landlord- tenant/lessor-lessee, a defendant of the suit of the present nature could enjoy the property during the pendency of the suit without depositing the amount of rent/damages (Para 14)
Code of Civil Procedure 1908- Order XV Rule 5- As per these provisions, in a suit by a lessor for eviction of a lessee after the determination of lease and for recovery of rent or compensation for use and occupation, the defendant is under the obligation: (1) to deposit the entire amount admitted by him to be due together with interest at the rate of 9% per annum on or before the first hearing of the suit; and (2) to regularly deposit the monthly amount due within a week of its accrual throughout the pendency of the suit. The consequence of default in making either of these deposits is that the Court may strike off his defence. The expression 'first hearing' means the date for filing written statement or the date for hearing mentioned in the summons; and in case of multiple dates, the last of them. The expression 'monthly amount due' means the amount due every month, whether as rent or damages for use and occupation at the admitted rate of rent after making no other deduction except taxes, if paid to the local authority on lessor's account. It is, however, expected that before making an order striking off defence, the Court would consider the representation of the defendant, if made within 10 days of the first hearing or within 10 days of the expiry of one week from the date of accrual of monthly amount (Para 9.1)

A single judge bench of Justice Suresh Kait of the Delhi High Court today rejected the bail application of a Delhi riots-accused, Shahrukh Pathan Khan, who faces charges of firing shots at a Head Constable of the Delhi Police in Jaffarabad in the Delhi Riots 2020 violence.
Placing reliance upon the video footages produced by the police as evidence, the court said, "The video clipping and pictures played before this Court have shaken the conscience of this Court how petitioner could take law and order in his hands."
It further said that regardless of his intention to kill the complainant or any person present in the public with his open air pistol shots, it was "hard to believe that he had no knowledge that his act may harm anyone present at the spot."
Referring to the facts of the case and Pathan's defence, the bench noted that, "...it is not the case of petitioner that he was not involved in the alleged incident."
The Karkardooma Court (Delhi) in November had refused to grant interim bail to Pathan, whose videos showing him "firing shots" at a policeman, during the February 2020 Delhi Riots had gone viral on the social media/internet.
Justice Kait held that, "...the learned trial court has rightly held that the petitioner is alleged to have participated in riots and his picture speaks a volume about his involvement."
The court also said that the worthiness of the complainant's statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. and the Pathan's claim that he "had not aimed (the) pistol to shoot at the complainant, shall be tested at trial."
Earlier, the Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat had rejected the interim bail plea of Pathan.
Pathan was caught on Feb 24 last year, brandishing a pistol with the temerity of firing and pointing it at police personnel Head Constable Deepak Dahiya, who was deputed on that day for law and order arrangements near Jaffarabad Metro Station.
The instant case against Pathan was registered under Sections 147, 148, 149, 216, 186, 307, 353 & 34 IPC read with Section 25 & 27 Arms Act. After the said incident near Jaffarabad Metro Station, he had absconded, however, he was arrested by the team of Delhi Police Crime Branch on Mar 3, 2020 from the Shamli Bus Stand, Uttar Pradesh on the basis of secret information.

The Orissa High Court has said that there is no specific rule under either the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 or the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Care and Maintenance of Case Property Animals) Rules, 2017 requiring mandatory denial of interim custody of seized cattle to the accused-owner.
While interpreting the provisions of the statute and the Rules, a Single Judge Bench of Justice Radha Krishna Pattanaik said, “…the animals may even be released in favour of the owner despite a conviction if there is no previous antecedent or he does not have any such past conduct or official record of his character which may influence the court not to handover the animals as there may be a possibility of being further exposed to cruelty.”
Factual Background
In 2022, some cattle were rescued while being transported allegedly for illegal slaughtering without proper care and arrangement of water, food and medical aid. The local police seized the cattle and handed them over to the petitioner, a Gaushala, for immediate care and maintenance as the animals were in extremely weak and miserable condition.
In the meantime, the accused filed a case before the court of the SDJM, Bhadrak for release of the cattle in his favour claiming himself as its owner. An order was passed by the SDJM releasing the seized cattle and custody was granted to the accused. A revision filed by the petitioner against the order before the Sessions court was dismissed. 
Contentions of Parties
It was argued on behalf of the petitioner that the provisions of Sections 11 and 35 of the Act have not been duly considered by the courts below. It was submitted that Rules 3 and 4 of the Rules are to be read carefully with a purposive interpretation. 
It was contended that during the pendency of the litigation, custody of the seized animals has to be given to an infirmary, pinjrapole, SPCA, Animal Welfare Organization or Gaushala. Thus, the cattle could not have been released in favour of the accused in the instant case.
On the other hand, the accused justified the release of the seized cattle by contending that he had purchased and was transporting it in a vehicle to a registered firm named ‘Faizan Diary Firm’ in support of which necessary proof was submitted. 
It was further contended that there has been due compliance of the provisions of the Rules and as the cost was deposited by the accused in the account of the petitioner towards expenses incurred in the maintenance of the cattle from the date of taking its zima and on execution of indemnity bond with other conditions, the release was lawful and needs no interference.
Court’s Ruling
The court said the decision with regard to custody of seized animals entirely depends on the conduct and character of the accused responsible for the cattle and interim custody may be disallowed if the court finds that there is a possibility of further cruelty to the animals if they are handed over to the accused. 
“The disposal of the animals is not prohibited either at the instance of its owner and it would amount to an offence and he would be punishable, if it established that at the time of such disposal, such animals suffered pain by reason of mutilation, starvation, thirst, overcrowding or other ill-treatment,” the court added.
The court categorically held that the Act does not prescribe any specific bar against interim release and custody of the animals rescued and recovered in favour of its owner. It said,
“In fact, authority has been provided to a Magistrate to detain the cattle at an infirmary, pinjrapole, SPCA, Animal Welfare Organization or Gaushala which is discretionary in nature in view of Rule 3(b) of the Rules, a provision related to custody of such animals pending litigation.”
The court said that to claim that there is an absolute bar against interim release of the animals in favour of the owner pending litigation or at the end of trial on conviction is not acceptable as the same is not contemplated under either the PCA Act or the Rules. 
“Rather discretionary power has been conferred on the Magistrate to deal with such release of animals depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case and may even exercise the jurisdiction to direct its release in favour of the owner even though he is prima facie responsible for treating the animals in a manner which amounts to cruelty under the PCA Act on a subjective satisfaction that such release is unlikely to subject the animals to further cruelty,” the court observed.
Having regard for the facts and the position of law, the court imposed certain conditions for further retention of custody of the animals by the accused and partially quashed the impugned order of the Sessions Court.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Wednesday observed that disputes between the two limbs of Government of India should not be brought to the Court, to be fought for years at the expense of public exchequer.
 "It would be desirable to relegate the parties to the Administrative Dispute Resolution Mechanism provided under the Office Memo" , the court observed.
 The observations were made by Justice Sanjeev Kumar while hearing a plea in terms of which the Hotel Corporation of India had challenged the notice for termination of the lease and subsequent eviction notice issued by the Estates Officer concerned.
 The petitioner Corporation also challenged the order passed by the Appellate Authority under the J&K Public Premises (Eviction of unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1988 dismissing its appeal against the eviction notice.
 Justice Kumar observed that the Hotel Corporation of India Ltd. is an autonomous body/Public Sector Undertaking subject to ultimate administrative control of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Government of India and the other party to the litigation is the Government of UT of Jammu and Kashmir which under the Constitution of India is administered by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.
 "The dispute raised in this petition is, thus, a dispute between an Autonomous Body (the petitioner-Corporation) fully owned, controlled and administered by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Government of India and the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir which is administered by the President of India through Lieutenant Governor who is answerable to the President through the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India", the court stated.
 Deprecating the tendency of various Government Departments and the Public Sector Undertaking entering into litigation inter se and consuming public time and public exchequer, the court observed that such disputes between the two limbs of Government of India should not be brought to the Court.
 Revealing its mind to address the controversy, the bench observed that the termination of lease and issuance of eviction notice by the Government of Jammu is resisted by the petitioner corporation and many issues of law and fact were debated before me in the matter. However, instead of going into all these issues and having regard to the fact that the dispute is between two limbs of Government of India, it would be desirable to relegate the parties to the Administrative Dispute Resolution Mechanism provided under the Office Memo issued by the Law Ministry for settlement of disputes other than relating to taxation.
 Accordingly the bench disposed off the plea by directing the Government of India through its Cabinet Secretary to constitute a Committee comprising of (i) Secretary to the Government Ministry of Civil Aviation, (ii) Secretary to the Government, Department of Home Affairs, and (iii) Secretary, Department of Legal Affairs to adjudicate the dispute in question that has arisen between the petitioner-Corporation and the Government of UT of Jammu and Kashmir.
 The court further directed that in case any of the parties is aggrieved by the decision of the Committee aforesaid, it shall be open to it to file an appeal before the Cabinet Secretary whose decision, on the subject, shall be final and binding on both the parties.
 "Should the Committee at its level fail to resolve the dispute between the parties for any reason whatsoever, the matter shall be referred to the Cabinet Secretary whose decision shall be final and binding on all the concerned", the bench added while giving Cabinet Secretary four weeks time to constitute a Committee from the date of judgment under an intimation to the disputing parties.

Deciding an appeal arising out of the Arbitration Act 1940, the Supreme Court has held that a department officer, who was appointed as the arbitrator, can continue to preside over the arbitration proceedings even after his retirement.
A bench comprising Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna was considering the question "whether once an officer of the department is appointed as an Arbitrator considering the arbitration clause, whether his mandate to continue the arbitration proceedings shall come to an end on his retirement?".
The further question posed was whether the conduct of the arbitration proceedings by such an Arbitrator after his retirement can be said to be committing a misconduct by such a Sole Arbitrator.
The dispute arose out of an agreement of 1988 between a contractor and the State of Uttar Pradesh. As per the Arbitration Clause, the Chief Engineer was to be the sole arbitrator for the disputes arising out of the agreement. In 1992, the arbitration proceedings commenced.
The award, which was passed in 1998 in favour of the contractor, was set aside by the High Court of Uttaranchal in 2007. The High Court held that the mandate of the Arbitrator came to an end with his retirement and his continuation of the proceedings after his retirement amounted to misconduct. In 2008, special leave petition was filed in the Supreme Court against the High Court's verdict.
The Supreme Court, referring to the provisions of the Arbitration Act 1940 and the Arbitration Agreement, held that there was legal infirmity in the arbitrator continuing with the arbitration after his retirement.
The judgment authored by Justice Shah observed :
"...the only qualification for appointment as an arbitrator is that he should be the officer of the rank of the Superintending Engineer or higher. Once such an officer is appointed as an Arbitrator, he continues to be the Sole Arbitrator till the arbitration proceedings are concluded unless he incurs the disqualification under the provisions of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940. Even after his retirement, the arbitration proceedings have to be continued by the same Arbitrator". 
"In the present case also the Sole Arbitrator, who at the relevant time was the Chief Engineer and was qualified to become the Sole Arbitrator was even nominated and/or appointed by the Chief Engineer as per clause 52.  Therefore, considering the clause 52 of the agreement, it cannot be said that his mandate to continue with the arbitration proceedings would come to an end on his retirement"
The Supreme Court held that the observations made by the High Court in the impugned judgment and order that the Sole Arbitrator has misconducted himself by continuing with the arbitration proceedings after his retirement are not tenable at law. 
The High Court's judgment was set aside and the award passed by the Sole Arbitrator dated 08.01.1998 was restored.

The Supreme Court observed that the provisions of Section 50 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance Act is required to be complied in the case of personal search only with but not in the case of search of vehicle.
The court also observed that merely because independent witnesses were not examined, the conclusion could not be drawn that accused was falsely implicated. Non­-production of contraband in the Court by itself is not fatal, the bench comprising Justices Indira Banerjee and JK Maheshwari observed while confirming the conviction of an accused in an NDPS case.
One Kallu Khan was concurrently convicted under Sections 8 & 21 of NDPS Act and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years along with fine of Rs. 1,00,000. In appeal, the accused made the following arguments: That in absence of handling and disposal of seized narcotic drags/psychotropic substances, the danger of re­circulation of seized contraband back into the system cannot be ruled out. That the procedure, as contemplated under Section 50(1) of NDPS Act, has not been followed. That the ownership of the vehicle is not of the accused, and the link of the vehicle in commission of the offence qua accused is missing. That the contraband article has not been produced in the court during evidence.
The court, perusing the case records,noted that while making search at public place, the contraband was seized from the motor cycle driven by the accused. "The seizure of the motor cycle from him is proved beyond reasonable doubt, therefore, the question of ownership of vehicle is not relevant.", the bench said.
Regarding non­-production of contraband in the court, the bench observed that when the seizure of material is proved on record and is not even disputed, the entire contraband material need not be placed on record. The court said:
"It is not a case in which the appellant has proved beyond reasonable doubt that while sending the samples for forensic tests, seals were not intact or the procedure has been materially not followed by protecting the seized substance or was not stored properly, as specified in the case of Mohan Lal (supra) in which case the directions were given to be followed on administrative side. However, in the facts of the case, the said judgment is not of any help to appellant. Similarly, in the case of Than Kumar vs. State of Haryana (2020) 5 SCC 260, this Court observed that if seizure is otherwise proved and the samples taken from and out of contraband material were kept intact; the report of forensic expert shows potency, nature and quality of contraband material, essential ingredients constituting offence are made out and the non­production of contraband in the Court is not fatal. As discussed above, the appellant has failed to show that 13 findings recorded by two Courts suffer from any perversity or illegality on the said issue and warrant interference"
Regarding non-­compliance of Section 50 of NDPS Act, the bench observed:
"15. Simultaneously, the arguments advanced by the appellant regarding non­compliance of Section 50 of NDPS Act is bereft of any merit because no recovery of contraband from the person of the accused has been made to which compliance of the provision of Section 50 NDPS Act has to follow mandatorily. In the present case, in the search of motor cycle at public place, the seizure of contraband was made, as revealed. Therefore, compliance of Section 50 does not attract in the present case. It is settled in the case of Vijaysinh (supra) that in the case of personal search only, the provisions of Section 50 of the Act is required to be complied with but not in the case of vehicle as in the present case, following the judgments of Surinder Kumar (supra) and Baljinder Singh (supra). Considering the facts of this Court, the argument of non­compliance of Section 50 of NDPS Act advanced by the counsel is hereby repelled."
The court added that in this case, the conduct of the accused was found suspicious and a chance recovery from the vehicle used by him is made from public place and proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
"The issue raised regarding conviction solely relying upon the testimony of police witnesses, without procuring any independent witness, recorded by the two courts, has also been dealt with by this Court in the case of Surinder Kumar (supra) holding that merely because independent witnesses were not examined, the conclusion could not be drawn that accused was falsely implicated.", the court said while dismissing the appeal.

The Madras High Court has ordered that SpiceJet Limited must be wound up and the assets must be taken over by the official liquidator on the grounds of proved inability of the Airlines to repay its debts.
 Justice R. Subramanian was adjudicating a company petition filed by Credit Suisse AG, a Switzerland based Stock Corporation and a creditor, who alleged inability on the part of respondent Airlines to pay the debts owed to the former.
 In the petition filed under Sections 433(e) and (f) r/w Sections 434 and 439 of the Companies Act, 1956, the single judge bench evoked the three-pronged test framed by the apex court in Mathusudan Gordhandas & Co. v. Madhu Woollen Industries (P) Ltd., (1971) 3 SCC 632 to determine the admission of winding up when the existence of debt is proved against SpiceJet Limited. The court iterated that the three-pronged test enunciated by the apex court involves, 
 Ascertaining if the defence of company is bonafide and is of substance, If such defence is likely to succeed on point of law, andIf the company produces prima facie proof of the facts on which the defence rests.
 While agreeing with the submissions made by Advocate Rahul Balaji appearing for the stock corporation, Justice R Subramanian recorded on the question of enforceability of debts after referring to Mathusudan and Madras HC judgment in Michael Hart v. M/s. Ninestars Information Technologies Ltd. (2013):
 "The three pronged test suggested by the Hon'ble Supreme Court which I have already extracted would show that the Company Court need not render a conclusive finding on the enforceability of the debt, while examining the issuance of notice of winding up or while examining the admission of a winding up petition. The question whether the documents require stamping or the question whether the bills of exchange are payable on demand or otherwise than on demand or questions which, as rightly pointed out by Mr. Rahul Balaji, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, will have to be examined at the time when the actual enforcement or examination of the claim of the petitioner by the Official Liquidator takes place."
 Background
 SpiceJet Limited (First Party) had availed the services of SR Technics(Second Party) in Switzerland for Air Craft maintenance and repair, among other related services, via an agreement that has the lifetime of 10 years, back in 2011. In 2021, a supplemental agreement was signed between the two parties that enabled the airlines to pay back the monies raised by SR Technics at various occasions through a deferred payment scheme.
 Before the High Court, the contentious matter was the seven invoices raised by SR Technics, the seven corresponding Bills of Exchange for the amount due under invoices, and the acknowledgement of debts through issuance of certificates of acceptance by the Airlines. In 2012, the stock corporation Credit Suisse AG (Third Party) was assigned all the rights to receive payments due to SR Technics through a financial agreement. The assignment also entitled the third party to receive payments from SpiceJet under the seven invoices issued by SR Technics.
 Even after repeated requests, SpiceJet shrugged off its responsibility to pay the monies due under the invoices, that too after a statutory notice under Sections 433 and 434 of the Companies Act, 1956. Therefore, the third party preferred a company petition for winding up under Section 433 (e), citing the inability on the part of the first party airlines to repay the debts.
 Arguments Raised
 The petitioner counsel, Advocate Rahul Balaji, argued before the court that a debt exists and a notice was issued under the Companies Act to the Airlines. Once a notice has been issued under Section 434(1) (a) of the Act and the failure of the company which in receipt of the said notice to repay the amount within three weeks or to secure the debt or to compound for it becomes evident, the winding-up procedure inevitably follows. To dispute the admission of winding up, the respondent company should prove a bona fide dispute or unenforceability of debt under Indian law, contended Mr. Balaji.
 The counsel argued that the Airlines has not disputed the utilisation of services by SR Technics. This, along with the fact that the invoices were accepted, Bills of Exchange and Certificates of Acceptance were issued by the first party airlines negates their argument that the debt is non-enforceable. The counsel also added that the dissection of debt enforceability is not warranted at the stage of admission of winding up; it is the duty of official liquidator to examiner the same and not the court's responsibility. The dispute on the adequacy of stamping the instruments need not be looked into at this stage, concluded the counsel.
 About the lack of a valid license for aircraft maintenance, the counsel would submit that the Debtor Company was aware of the same and still availed the services of Second Party Company. These contentions raised by the Airlines were rejected during the arbitration proceedings in UK as well, added Mr. Balaji.
 Along with the arguments that it was a bona fide dispute and the debt was unenforceable, Senior Advocate V. Ramakrishnan would submit that there wasn't a contractual relationship between the Airlines and the Stock Corporation. He also argued that the assignment of rights was contrary to the agreement between SR Technics and SpiceJet. Another argument was raised by the respondent airlines that SR Technics did not have a valid license to carry out Air Craft maintenance services from the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and therefore the enforcement of the claim would be against public policy.
  The counsel would also argue that the Bills of Exchange are not payable on demand since a fixed date of six months from the date of issue has been mentioned, which makes stamping a prerequisite for those instruments. In the absence of stamping, the Bills of Exchange and agreements can't be considered as a valid evidence of existing debt, argued the Senior Counsel. In addition to the arguments about the improper stamping of instruments ranging from original and supplemental agreements, Invoices, Bills of Exchange and Certificates of Acceptance, the counsel also put forward an argument that the arbitral award in UK in favour of corporation cannot be a ground before Madras High Court where the Indian Laws would apply. Finally, he also submitted that the endorsement of Bills of Exchange are not in the form required as per the agreement between the Stock Corporation and SR Technics, which renders the endorsements on the instrument invalid.
 Court's Observations And Findings
 Placing reliance on Section 434(1)(a) and Section 433 of the Companies Act, the court observed:
 "Once a notice is issued under Section 434 of the Companies Act, a deeming fiction is created regarding the inability to pay the debt, therefore it becomes the obligation on the part of the respondent/debtor Company to show that the debt itself is illegal or that there is no debt at all, if it has to escape the consequence of issuance of a winding up notice."
 The court noted that the existence of the debt has been proved in the case at hand due to the deeming fiction created by Section 434 of the Act. The primary question before the court would be then to test the bona fides of defences put forward by the debtor company against the standards of three-pronged test formulated by the apex court.
 "I therefore do not propose to go into the requirements as to stamping. I must point out, even ignoring the agreements and the bills of exchange, the certificates of acceptance that had been issued by the respondent would show that there is a categorical admission of liability. Each of the bills of exchange is supported by a certificate of acceptance. The respondent has not denied the execution of the certificates of acceptance", the court observed in the order.
 In addition to the apex court judgment and the Madras High Court DB judgment in Michael Hart, the court also referred to the Bombay High Court Judgment in Classic Diamonds (India) Ltd., v. ICICI Bank Limited (2016) to opine that the question relating to stamping or sufficiency of stamping is really foreign to the scope of the proceedings, i.e., admission of winding up.
 "When a Division Bench of this Court had categorically laid down that even production of the document is unnecessary as the execution of the document is not denied, I do not think it will be proper for me to dwell into the aspect of stamping or the character of the document whether it is a bill of exchange payable on demand or it is a bill of exchange payable otherwise on demand etc. in these proceedings", the court made one of its final observations on the aspect of deciding the enforceability of debts at this stage.
 On the SpiceJet's submission that endorsements made are not in the proper form as stipulated by the agreement, the court opines that the Airlines was aware of the ability of SR Technics to endorse the Bills of Exchange in favour of Credit Suisse AG since the 2012 supplemental agreement between SpiceJet and SR Technics had a clause to that effect. It was only in pursuance of the agreement that certificates of acceptance in support of such Bills of Exchange were issued by the respondent company.
 The court also places on record that by virtue of the said supplemental agreement, the respondent company could avail a six months deferred payment scheme.
 "Therefore, it is clear that the respondent Company had obtained an advantage of a deferred payment by execution of these documents and the denial there of, in my considered opinion, cannot be said to be bona fide. Having obtained an advantage under the supplementary agreement and having executed the documents as required, the respondent cannot now seek to evade liability raising technical objections relating to stamping of the instrument", the court made its observations on the bona fides of defence set out by the Airlines.
 On the respondent counsel's arguments pertaining to the lack of SR Technic's License to carry out Air Craft Maintenance as per DGCA, the court gave its attention to a particular clause(Clause 14.3) in the agreement between SpiceJet and SR Technics, which would have allowed the former to terminate the agreement by a written notice in case any certification required by SR Technics was revoked or suspended by the concerned authorities:
 "It is not in dispute that the respondent Company had not invoked Clause 14.3 and terminated the agreement. It chooses to avail of the services of SR Technics despite being aware of the fact that SR Technics did not possess a valid authorisation by DGCA."
 Further, Clause 14.4 of the agreement requires both parties to fulfil all obligations prior to the termination of agreement under Clause 14.3. It was also open to the parties to make claims for breach of obligations under the agreement even post termination of the agreement. The court interpreted this clause to hold as follows:
 "…while it was open to SpiceJet Limited to terminate the contract for the reason that SR Technics did not have a valid authorisation the termination by itself would not relive SpiceJet Limited of the obligations that arose under the contract prior to such termination becoming effective."
 Accordingly, the court held that the respondent company has 'failed miserably' to satisfy the three-pronged test of the apex court on the bona fides of defences set out, and that the company should be wound up for its inability to pay the debt owed under Section 433 (e) of the Companies Act 1956.
 Finally, on the operation of the said order, the senior counsel for respondents requested two weeks' stay to allow themselves time for filing an appeal. The court has acceded to the same by granting a stay on the operation of order for a period of three weeks, provided that SpiceJet Limited deposits an amount equivalent to five million dollars to the credit of Company Petition No.363/2015 within a period of two weeks from the date of the order.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court on Wednesday called for a jail status report from the Director-General, Prison and Correctional Services (Madhya Pradesh) with regard to arrangements made to keep the male and female inmates as well as under trials and convicted inmates in separate jails.
The order came from the Bench of Justice Rajeev Kumar Shrivastava while dealing with a bail plea filed in connection with an offence registered under Section 34(2) of the M.P. Excise Act.
It has been alleged that from the possession of the applicants, namely, Roma Kanjar and Hemlata Kanjar 600 bulk liters of liquor was recovered, however, they have denied the said allegations.
Importantly, it was submitted by the counsel for the applicants that they have been in Datia jail since July 27, 2021, and being a lady, it is very tough for them to accommodate in the jail custody, as the female and male offenders/ undertrials are kept in the same campus in jail custody. 
It was also contended that Investigation and trial will take its own time. As the applicants are ladies and they are in custody since 27/7/2021, therefore, it was prayed that they be granted bail.
In this backdrop, the bail application was allowed and it was directed that they shall be released on bail on each of them furnishing a personal bond of Rs.1,00,000/-.
However, before parting with the matter, the court called for the jail status report from the Director-General, Prison and Correctional Services (M.P.) with regard to arrangements made to keep the male and female inmates as well as under trials and convicted inmates in separate jails. 
The State has been directed to submit the aforesaid report before Principal Registrar of this Court within a period of one month, who in turn has been directed to place the same on the administrative side. 
The Court directed that the copy of the order be sent to the trial Court concerned as well as State counsel for necessary compliance. The registry has been asked to communicate the order to Director General, Prison and Correctional Services (M.P.) for compliance.

The Supreme Court has observed that there is no reason to continue the sealing of premises by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi if they were actually sold as shops."If it is a fact that the premises which have been sealed on the ground of unauthorised change of user from residential to commercial, was actually sold as a shop, we see no reason why the sealing should...
The Supreme Court has observed that there is no reason to continue the sealing of premises by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi if they were actually sold as shops.
"If it is a fact that the premises which have been sealed on the ground of unauthorised change of user from residential to commercial, was actually sold as a shop, we see no reason why the sealing should continue", said a bench headed by the Chief Justice of India SA Bobde.
The bench made this observation while considering an application filed by Defence Colony Market Welfare Association. Senior Advocate P S Narasimha, appearing for the association, submitted that many shops were sealed by the authorities alleging unauthorized conversion of residential use to commercial use. The senior counsel submitted that the premises were originally purchased as shops and hence there was no question of unauthorized conversion of user.
In this context, the bench observed that t is important to ascertain which of the premises which have been sealed were originally purchased as shops meant for commercial use.
"We accordingly consider it appropriate to direct that a list be prepared of all such premises which were originally purchased as shops and have now been sealed on the ground that residential premises have been converted unauthorisedly to commercial premises", observed the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.
Observing that the issue related to the right to livelihood of the members of the Defence Colony Market Welfare Association, the bench directed Advocate ADN Rao, the amicus curiae, to file a report after scrutinizing the relevant documents related to the original purchase of the premises. The report has to be submitted within four weeks.
The Court has also permitted South Delhi Municipal Corporation to point out documents showing the true status of the shops in question.
In August 2020, the Court had set aside the sealing of residential units done by the Court-appointed Monitoring Committee observing that the Committee had never been authorized to take action against the residential premises that were not being used for commercial purposes.
The sealing drive was launched by the MCD in 2006 to close illegal commercial establishments. In April 2006, the Supreme Court intervened and appointed a Monitoring Committee to address the issue of use of residential premises for commercial purposes, and to inspect premises in which illegal constructions had been made.

The Allahabad High Court today observed that an application under Section 482 CrPC is maintainable to quash the proceedings, which are ex facie bad for want of sanction as required under Section 197 of Crpc (Prosecution of Judges and public servants).
With this, the Bench of Justice Chandra Kumar Rai set aside a summoning order passed by the Judicial Magistrate Farrukhabad against a Lekhpal (applicant number 1) and a Kanoongo (applicant number 2) in the Consolidation department (both public servants) without obtaining necessary sanction as provided under Section 197 of CrPC.
The Case in brief
Essentially, during a consolidation proceeding, a joint plot was allotted to opposite party No.2 (one Ram Singh) and on his application filed in August 2006, the Settlement Officer of Consolidation directed that measurements of the land be taken in accordance with the law.
In pursuance of the order, both the applicants, being public servants (Lekhpal and Kanoongo) conducted measurement of disputed plots with the help of local police and submitted their report on November 15, 2006.
However, Opposite party No.2 filed a complaint on November 27, 2006, before the Judicial Magistrate, Farrukhabad with the allegation that both the applicants illegally made measurements of the plot, in which crops were standing and there was an order dated November 15, 2006, to stop the measurement.
The Judicial Magistrate summoned the applicant under Section 427 IPC, without considering the fact that applicants are public servants and they were discharging their official duties.
Contention put forth
Before the High Court, the counsel for the applicants argued that the applicants were discharging their duties to measure the plots, as such the private complaint against the applicants are not maintainable unless necessary sanction as provided under Section 197 of Code of Criminal Procedure is obtained. 
It was further argued that applicants were not aware of the further order passed by the Settlement Officer Consolidation to stop the measurement.
Court's observations
At the outset, the Court referred to Section 197 CrPC to infer that the object of sanction for prosecution is to protect a public servant discharging official duties and functions from harassment by the initiation of a frivolous criminal proceeding.
Explaining the scope of this section further, the Court said that the protection given under Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code has its limitation and it is available only when alleged act done by the public servant is reasonably connected with the discharge of his official duty.
"If in doing official duty public officer if committed any mistake or has been summoned in excess of duty even then the sanction of the Government as provided under Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code is mandatory," the Court added.
Further, relying upon the Judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of D. Devaraja vs. Owais Sabeer Hussain reported in [2020 (113) ACC and 904], the High court observed thus:
"...it is well settled that an application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is maintainable to quash the proceedings, which are ex facie bad for want of sanction. If, on the face of complaint, the act alleged appears to have a reasonable relationship with official duty power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. would have to be exercised to quash the proceedings to prevent abuse of process of Court."
With this, the application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. was allowed and the summoning order passed by the Judicial Magistrate  Farrukhabad was set aside and the complaint was also quashed for want of sanction in the exercise of HC's power under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

The Supreme Court has observed that in matters relating to service jurisprudence it is not essential to implead each and everyone who could be affected but if a section of such affected employees is impleaded then the interest of all is represented and protected.
The bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and BV Nagarathna in the present matter was considering civil appeals against the Allahabad High Court's order dated December 4, 2019.
The High Court while allowing the appeal against the order of Single Judge had observed that there was extraordinary delay on the part of the writ petitioners in approaching the Court in as much as the seniority list of 2006 which had formed the basis of the 2009 seniority list, was not challenged within a reasonable time.
The Single Judge had set aside the final seniority list and had directed the appointing authority for preparation of fresh seniority list in accordance with Uttar Pradesh Government Servants Seniority Rules, 1991, be it Rule 5 or Rule 8 thereof.
While allowing the appeals, the Supreme Court noted in the instant case Ajay Kumar Shukla And Others V. Arvind Rai And Others :
"In matters relating to service jurisprudence, time and again it has been held that it is not essential to implead each and every one who could be affected but if a section of such affected employees is impleaded then the interest of all is represented and protected. In view of the above, it is well settled that impleadment of a few of the affected employees would be sufficient compliance of the principle of joinder of parties and they could defend the interest of all affected persons in their representative capacity. Non-joining of all the parties cannot be held to be fatal."
Factual Matrix 
The Chief Engineer, Department of Minor Irrigation send a requisition dated June 18, 1998 to the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission ("Commission") requesting for recruiting 206 posts of Junior Engineers in the Department of Minor Irrigation which were divided between agriculture, mechanical and civil streams in the ratio of 50:30:20 respectively.
The Commission issued an Advertisement No 3 of 1998-1999 for inviting applications for the post of Junior Engineers and after finalizing the results, the Commission forwarded three separate select lists to the Minor Irrigation Department of the State Government. Based upon the three select lists forwarded by the Commission the appointment letter was issued on October 8, 2001, which clearly indicated that the issue regarding seniority would be decided later on.
A tentative seniority list was published in 2006 vide office order dated March 17, 2006 with respect to all the Junior Engineers appointed after January 1, 1989 and by office order dated September 5, 2006 published a final seniority list. In 2009, the Department took a fresh exercise of preparing the seniority list as the Rules relating to Junior Engineers were framed by the Minor Irrigation Department for the first time.
Accordingly pursuant to publication of a provisional seniority list objections were invited by order dated December 29,2009 and thus on March 5, 2010 a final seniority list was published.
Paragraph 11 of the office order dated March 5, 2010 had referred that the Commission had sent three separate lists i.e. of Agricultural stream on September 28, 1999, Mechanical stream on January 6, 2000 and Civil stream on November 7, 2000 and the candidates of the three lists were placed by the Department in the same sequence as they were received with their inter se seniority in their respective lists. 
Since the appellants (belonging to mechanical and civil stream) came to know of the mode of preparation of the seniority list after the publication of the final list on March 3, 2010 they approached the High Court after no heed was paid to their representations for correcting the seniority list, by considering the inter se merit of all the three streams i.e. Agricultural, Mechanical and Civil on the basis of the marks obtained in their examinations . They argued that they were under the bona fide belief that the department had prepared a seniority list inter se between all three streams as per the selection and result conveyed by the Commission. 
Although the Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court on May 14, 2019 allowed the writ but on preference of an intra court appeal by the respondents (Agriculture Stream), the Division Bench of the High Court on December 4, 2019 dismissed the same. 
The Division Bench while dismissing the writ had observed that there was extraordinary delay on the part of the writ petitioners in approaching the Court in as much as the seniority list of 2006 which had formed the basis of the 2009 seniority list, was not challenged within a reasonable time. 
The High Court had further observed that all the affected Junior Engineers having not been impleaded would be fatal on the principle of non-joinder of necessary parties. It was also opined that the appellants having participated in selection/appointment process, later on, could not challenge the process as such action would be hit by doctrine of estoppel and acquiescence.
The appellants thus approached the Top Court.
Submissions Of Counsels
Senior Advocate Siddarth Dave and Advocate Preetika Dwivedi appearing for the Appellants submitted that there was no delay on appellant's part in approaching the Court as they learnt for the first time in 2010 when the final seniority list was published on March 5, 2010 that there were three separate select lists forwarded by the Commission. It was also their contention that based upon the date of the receipt of such a select list, the seniority list had been prepared, which was contrary to the statutory rules.
It was also their contention that as the challenge was to the decision-making process in making the seniority list contrary to the Uttar Pradesh Government Servants Seniority Rules, 1991 and Uttar Pradesh Minor Irrigation Department Subordinate Engineering Service Rules, 2009 ("Rules 2009") it was not necessary to implead all the affected Engineers. Appellant's counsel further contended that the earlier seniority list would lose significance since a fresh seniority list had to be prepared as Rules 2009 had come into force that required drawing up of a fresh seniority list.
Senior Advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan and Advocate Rohit Sthalekar appearing for the respondents submitted that appellants had approached the Court with extraordinary delay and therefore, their claim was not entitled to be entertained and the Division Bench of the High Court rightly upheld the said submission.
Supreme Court's Analysis
The bench in the judgment authored by Justice Vikram Nath observed that the Appointing Authority, in fact, committed an error in the manner in which the seniority list was prepared by placing the three select lists forwarded by the Commission on different dates one after the other en bloc as per the date of receipt of three select lists. The court further opined that by an oversight, the Appointing Authority failed to prepare the combined seniority list as required under 1991 Seniority Rules, be it Rule 5 or Rule 8 with respect to the selection of the appellants and private-respondents.
On the aspect of delay in approaching the court and in particular challenge to a seniority list, the bench observed that, 
"Once it is established that the seniority list was prepared in contravention to the statutory provisions laid down in Rules 1991, the seniority list could be interfered with. The Appointing Authority would be bound by the statutory rules and any violation or disregard to the statutory rules would vitiate the seniority list. The same would be arbitrary, de hors the rules and in conflict with Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The only exception to the above would be where there is unreasonable delay which is unexplained."
Appointing Authority Ought To Have Prepared A Combined Merit List Based Upon The Performance Or The Proficiency-Based On The Marks Received In The Selection Test As Prepared By The Commission
Further the bench also observed that the appointing authority ought to have prepared a combined merit list based upon the performance or the proficiency on the basis of the marks received in the selection test as prepared by the Commission. In this regard the Court further added that otherwise, it would amount to denial of the right of consideration for promotion to a more meritorious candidate as against a candidate having lesser merit. 
"Right to promotion is not considered to be a fundamental right but consideration for promotion has now been evolved as a fundamental right," the Court further said.
"If the seniority list is allowed to be sustained then the engineers who are more meritorious in the Mechanical and Civil streams than the Junior Engineers of the Agricultural stream would be deprived of their right of being considered for promotion and in fact their right would accrue only after all the Junior Engineers of the Agricultural stream selected in the same selection are granted promotion. For these reasons also the seniority list in question must go," the court added.

The Karnataka High Court has said that if a party, opposing the proceedings instituted under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, fails to raise the ground of delay in filing the complaint before the court of first instance, the Court in Appeal is empowered to remand the matter back for fresh consideration on the issue of condonation of delay under Section 142(b) of the Act.
 A single judge bench of Justice H P Sandesh said,
"In the case on hand also this is a peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and no such contention was taken before the Trial Court by the petitioners (accused under Section 138 NI Act) and if they had raised the issue of delay before the Trial Court, the complainant ought to have been given an opportunity to make necessary application to condone the delay and admittedly for the first time, the issue has been raised before the Appellate Court. Only on the ground that there is a delay, the complaint of the complainant cannot be thrown to the dustbin."
 Case Background:
 The petitioners M/S. A. Seating and others filed the revision petition praying before the High Court to set aside the judgment of Trial Court in convicting the petitioners herein for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and to set aside the judgment of the Appellate Court remanding the case to the Trial Court.
 Complainant was running an industry in the name of M/s. Nandini Modulars. The accused gave an undertaking to the complainant that he will discharge the amount of Rs.13,58,921/- within 15 days and also issued four cheques as security to the said loan amount in favour of the complainant. On presentation of those cheques, the same were dishonoured with an endorsement as 'funds insufficient'.
 A complaint was filed and cognizance was taken and the petitioners were secured and they did not plead guilty. The Trial Court after considering both the oral and documentary evidence, convicted the petitioners herein.
 In appeal the accused raised a contention that the complaint is barred by limitation and there is no application filed before the Trial Court and very initiation of the proceeding against the petitioners is erroneous. The appellate court remanded the matter to consider the same afresh by giving an opportunity to the(b) complainant to file necessary application for condonation of delay and directed the Trial Court to decide the application first and thereafter proceed with the matter as per law relying upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Pawan Kumar Ralli and consequently, set aside the order of conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court
 Petitioners submissions:
 It was contended, "There was a delay of seven days in filing the complaint and the Appellate Court wrongly observed that ground of delay was not raised at all before the Trial Court. Further, the Appellate Court has no power under the Cr.P.C to remand the case to the Trial Court for the purpose of giving an opportunity to the complainant to file a condonation of delay application. by filing the complaint itself, the delay application ought to have been filed and the same is not filed and the question of giving an opportunity does not arise.
 Complainant opposed the plea:
 The counsel argued, "Since for the first time, the petitioner had raised the objection with regard to the delay in filing the complaint. Hence, the Appellate Court considering the said application comes to the conclusion that deciding such an application is within the exclusive domain of the Magistrate to exercise his discretion to condone the delay and not the Appellate Court and also comes to the conclusion that the Appellate Court cannot usurp the jurisdiction of the Trial Court.
 Further, it directed the complainant to prefer an application under Section 142(b) of the N.I. Act before the Trial Court and the Trial Court after taking objections from the petitioners herein shall decide the application first and then proceed in accordance with law.
 Court findings:
 The bench went through the order of the appellate court and said, "For the first time, the issue of delay is raised before the Appellate Court."
 Further it said ,"If such defence was taken before the Trial Court as directed by this Court in the case of G. Thimmappa (supra), ought to have filed an application for condonation of delay. It is further observed that if delay is noticed, the Trial Court can even call upon the complainant to file an application for condonation of delay. No circumstances was arisen before the Trial Court."
 It added,
 "An amendment was brought in the year 2003 to Section 142 and clause (b) was inserted keeping in mind the reasons and objects of the Act and to obviate the complainant of the hardship. The Court has to take note of the wisdom of the legislature in bringing such an amendment and when the issue is raised for the first time in the appeal, the Court has to take note of all these factors into consideration."
 Then the court observed ,When the issue of limitation is raised before the Appellate Court, immediately the complainant has filed an application before the Appellate Court for condonation of delay and the Appellate Court comes to the conclusion that the delay cannot be considered in Appellate Court usurping the powers of the Trial Court and the same has to be dealt with by the Trial Court.
 It added, "The Court (appellate) has to take note of the very proviso of Section 142(b) of the N.I. Act which confers jurisdiction upon the Court to condone the delay i.e. original Court or otherwise the very purpose and wisdom of the parliament would be defeated."
 Accordingly it dismissed the petition. It directed the trial Court to dispose of the matter within one year.

The Delhi High Court has said that merely because a woman consents to be in the company of a man, “regardless of for how long”, can never be the basis to infer that she had also consented to “sexual liaison” with him.
Observing that a distinction needs to be articulated between a prosecutrix “consenting to a situation” vs. “consenting to sexual liaison,” Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani said:
“Though it is universally accepted that consent given under force, coercion or duress is no consent in law since it is not free or volitional, in many cases it is necessary to examine consent in a more granular manner, with the awareness that substantivity of consent may also be vitiated by several other circumstances that erode the freedom of choice. Several circumstances, including emotional exploitation, may vitiate the substantivity of consent.”
The court said 'consent' as opposed to 'compulsion' requires a more nuanced consideration. 
"Though it is universally accepted that consent given under force, coercion or duress is no consent in law since it is not free or volitional, in many cases it is necessary to examine consent in a more granular manner, with the awareness that substantivity of consent may also be vitiated by several other circumstances that erode the freedom of choice. Several circumstances, including emotional exploitation, may vitiate the substantivity of consent," it added.
The court made the observations while denying regular bail to a man accused of raping a Czech national by pretending to be a “spiritual guru” who would help her perform the post-demise rituals of her deceased husband.
It is alleged that the man molested the prosecutrix in a hostel in Delhi in 2019 and subsequently engaged in “physical liaison” with her in Prayagraj and Bihar in January and February of 2020. 
The FIR was filed in March last year under sections 354 and 376 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and chargesheet was filed in May 2022. 
The counsel appearing for the petitioner-accused submitted that the prosecutrix was a major and any physical relations with her were entirely consensual. 
It was contended that the FIR was registered much after the incidents at Delhi and that neither any complaint nor any effort was made by the prosecutrix to register any FIR at other places where she was allegedly sexually assaulted. 
It was further submitted that the petitioner in fact guided the prosecutrix through post demise rituals of her deceased husband.
On the other hand, the counsel representing the State submitted that only eight out of the 16 prosecution witnesses have been examined and that one of the crucial witnesses, a lady who is stated to be the prosecutrix’s friend, is yet to be examined. 
It was also contended that mere delay in registration of FIR is never fatal and that the petitioner is a manipulative person, who represented himself to be a spiritual guru. It was also submitted that the accused “played on the prosecutrix's vulnerabilities” after the untimely demise of her husband and this gave an “element of dominance” to him over the prosecutrix, which he exploited unashamedly.
Perusing the documents on record, the court noted that though it is nowhere alleged that the petitioner accused held the prosecutrix hostage or that she was made to travel with him by use of physical force or restraint, that alone would not be determinative of the state of prosecutrix’s mind to say that the alleged sexual liaisons were consensual. 
“Though the first incident of physical relations is alleged to have happened in a hostel in Delhi itself, the nature of the act alleged in that instance was not rape, and in any case the prosecutrix's silence in relation to that act cannot be taken to be a licence for more aggravated sexual liaison, as has been alleged subsequently,” it said. 
The court observed that merely because the prosecutrix agreed to accompany the petitioner accused to various holy places for conducting last rites and rituals of her deceased husband, does not ipso facto, imply that she consented to sexual relations with him. 
“Merely because a prosecutrix consents to being in the company of a man, regardless of for how long, can never be the basis to infer that she had also consented to sexual liaison with the man,” the court said.
Justice Bhambhani also said that irrespective of whether the prosecutrix and the prime witness are in India or abroad, the petitioner’s attempt to intimidate or influence them cannot be ruled out.
“The delay in registration of the FIR has been sought to be explained on the same basis, viz. the prosecutrix‟s emotionally vulnerable state, as also the fact that she was in alien places and environments where she was fearful of consequences if she had made a police complaint,” the court added.
While denying regular bail to the petitioner, the court however granted him liberty to apply afresh for the same relief before the trial court, once the deposition of all prosecution witnesses is complete.
“Nothing in this order shall be construed as an expression of opinion on the merits of the pending matter,” it said.

The... The Supreme Court reiterated that reinstatement with full back wages is not automatic in every case, where termination / dismissal is found to be not in accordance with procedure prescribed under law. In this case, an employee appointed as Clerk-cum-Cashier was dismissed from service by the Allahabad Bank alleging his involvement in the incident relating to burning of bank records. The Industrial Tribunal found that though there was a strong suspicion, but there was no sufficient evidence to prove his misconduct to dismiss from service. The Tribunal found that the Bank has lost confidence on the respondent and ordered payment of monetary compensation of Rs.30,000/- in lieu of reinstatement. The High Court, while disposing an appeal against this award passed by the Tribunal, directed the employer to reinstate the workman with all consequential benefits. During the pendency of appeal before the Apex Court, the employee attained age of superannuation. "The reinstatement with full back wages is not automatic in every case, where termination / dismissal is found to be not in accordance with procedure prescribed under law. Considering that the respondent was in effective service of the Bank only for about six years and he is out of service since 1991, and in the meantime, respondent had attained age of superannuation, we deem it appropriate that ends of justice would be met by awarding lump sum monetary compensation. ", the bench of Justices R. Subhash Reddy and Sanjiv Khanna observed. Thus, the bench directed payment of lump sum compensation of Rs.15 lakhs to him within a period of eight weeks. In a judgment delivered in another case [Ram Manohar Lohia Joint Hospital vs. Munna Prasad Saini], the court set aside the direction for reinstatement and enhanced the compensation by awarding a lump sum amount. In the said case, the bench referred to following observations in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited v. Bhurumal (2014) 7 SCC 177:
The ordinary principle of grant of reinstatement with full back wages, when the termination is found to be illegal is not applied mechanically in all cases. While that may be a position where services of a regular/permanent workman are terminated illegally and/or mala fide and/or by way of victimisation, unfair labour practice, etc. However, when it comes to the case of termination of a daily-wage worker and where the termination is found illegal because of a procedural defect, namely, in violation of Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act, this Court is consistent in taking the view that in such cases reinstatement with back wages is not automatic and instead the workman should be given monetary compensation which will meet the ends of justice. Rationale for shifting in this direction is obvious.The reasons for denying the relief of reinstatement in such cases are obvious. It is trite law that when the termination is found to be illegal because of non-payment of retrenchment compensation and notice pay as mandatorily required under Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act, even after reinstatement, it is always open to the management to terminate the services of that employee by paying him the retrenchment compensation. Since such a workman was working on daily-wage basis and even after he is reinstated, he has no right to seek regularisation [see State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3)]. Thus when he cannot claim regularisation and he has no right to continue even as a daily-wage worker, no useful purpose is going to be served in reinstating such a workman and he can be given monetary compensation by the Court itself inasmuch as if he is terminated again after reinstatement, he would receive monetary compensation only in the form of retrenchment compensation and notice pay. In such a situation, giving the relief of reinstatement, that too after a long gap, would not serve any purpose.We would, however, like to add a caveat here. There may be cases where termination of a daily-wage worker is found to be illegal on the ground that it was resorted to as unfair labour practice or in violation of the principle of lastcome-first-go viz. while retrenching such a worker daily wage juniors to him were retained. There may also be a situation that persons junior to him were regularised under some policy but the workman concerned terminated. In such circumstances, the terminated worker should not be denied reinstatement unless there are some other weighty reasons for adopting the course of grant of compensation instead of reinstatement. In such cases, reinstatement should be the rule and only in exceptional cases for the reasons stated to be in writing, such a relief can be denied. 
In a case filed by a candidate claiming reservation based on her status of being a person from a 'Scheduled Tribe', the Himachal Pradesh High Court has held that reservation cannot be claimed by a person in the migratory state upon migration from another state even when such migration took place for reasons of marriage.
 The case related to a petitioner-woman, who by birth belonged to the Gujjar caste of Haryana. The petitioner got married to one Nain Singh, who also belonged to the same caste. The caste of the petitioner, before and after marriage, remained same, the only difference being that Gujjar Community is recognised as a 'Scheduled Tribe' in Himachal Pradesh, whereas in Haryana, it is recognised as an OBC Community.
 The petitioner later applied for the post of a Language Teacher (ST), for batch-wise recruitment, however, the respondent-authorities refused her recruitment based on the ground that the petitioner was not a 'Scheduled Tribe' candidate, and so she could not be accorded the benefit of reservation as was sought for by her.
 The moot question for Court's consideration was whether upon migration from one State to another, can a person, who may be belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes or OBC claim the benefit of such status in the migratory State.
 The division bench of Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Justice Virender Singh held that migration was not a sufficient cause for claiming the benefit in other State by a person, even if such migration was on account of marriage.
 The High Court stated that the objective criteria for declaration of a particular Caste or Tribe as SC/ST/OBC in one State is the specific level of backwardness, social disparage and economic disadvantages prevalent in such state.
This has been the consistent view of the Supreme Court in Dr. Jaishri Laxman Rao Patil v. Chief Minister and Others and Bhadar Ram (deceased) through legal representatives v. Jassa Ram and Others, it noted.
 "Though, one Caste notified as Scheduled Caste/ Tribe/ OBC in one State may also find place in the list of notified Scheduled Caste/ Tribe/OBC in the other, but the same has not been held to be sufficient for claiming the benefit in other State by a person after migration even through marriage" – added the division bench of the High Court.

The Calcutta High Court has recently upheld the conviction of a husband for the commission of the offence of dowry death under Section 304B of the IPC after opining that it is impossible for witnesses such as neighbours to state whether the victim housewife was tortured within the four corners of the matrimonial home or not.
A Bench comprising Justice Bivas Pattanayak and Justice Joymalya Bagchi noted from the evidence on record that marks of injury had been found on the body off the deceased and that in addition to the ligature mark, investigating officers had found swelling on the back of the head and bruise marks on the left palm of the deceased.
Acknowledging that it is very unlikely that the deceased would confide in witnesses such as neighbours about the torture that was meted out to her, the Court underscored, 
"These injuries show victim housewife had been subjected to physical assault immediately prior to her death probabilising the saga of torture as narrated by her relations. When a housewife is tortured within four corners of the matrimonial home, persons to whom she would ordinarily confide are her parents and close relations. It is highly unlikely she would narrate her misfortune to outsiders including neighbours. Analysing the evidence on record from this perspective, I am of the opinion evidence of parents and other relations of the victim girl with regard to torture meted out to her over further demand of money are wholly reliable. Evidence of the defence witnesses appear to be tutored. None of the witnesses were privy to the household affairs of the appellants."
Thus, the Court opined that the defence witnesses are untrustworthy and that it is impossible for them to state whether victim housewife was tortured within the four corners of the matrimonial home or not.
It was further noted that the post-mortem doctors had found ligature mark the neck of the victim and had opined death was due to asphyxia arising out of ante mortem hanging. It was also noted that the concerned doctor had found clotted blood and product of conception (gestational sac) in the uterus.
"From these findings it appears that the victim housewife who was pregnant had been subjected to torture over demands of dowry and was brutally assaulted at the matrimonial home prior to her death. Unable to bear such torture, she committed suicide", the Court opined. 
Accordingly, the Court rejected the 'absurd' plea that the victim had committed suicide as she was unhappy with the financial status of her husband and further observed that consistent evidence on record shows that she had been physically and mentally tortured at the matrimonial home over further demands of dowry.
Upholding the order of conviction against the husband, the Court observed, 
 "These circumstances wholly rule out the fanciful plea of suicide by an over-emotional lady who was unhappy with her unsuccessful husband."
The Court however acquitted the mother-in-law and the father-in-law after observing that no specific overt act has been attributed either to the father in law or mother in-law regarding torture on the victim housewife over further demands of dowry.
Case Title: Raju Mitra & Ors v. State of West Bengal

The Karnataka High Court has said that in the event an employee suffers from disability of 40% or more while performing duty, as a matter of right such an employee would be entitled for benefit of downgrading of cadre in order to continue service without any adverse impact on the pay and other benefits.
A single judge bench of Justice Suraj Govindaraj gave this clarification while allowing a petition filed by a one M.B.Jayadevaiah and quashed the general order issued by Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) and directed it to restore pay of the petitioner applicable to the post of driver which the petitioner was drawing before his cadre was downgraded in the year 2002 and pay him arrears of salary and extend all other consequential benefits.
The petitioner was appointed as a driver in the corporation in the year 1984. While discharging his duties on 04.07.1999, the vehicle met with an accident wherein the petitioner sustained severe injuries. 
In view of the petitioner not being in a position to discharge his duties as a driver, after conducting the necessary scrutiny and obtaining the certificates and opinion from the Medical Board, the competent authority by way its order dated 04.09.2002, directed the cadre of the petitioner be changed from driver to that of the office attender and assigned duties in a depot. 
The said order was passed in terms of the Circular No.681 dated 09.09.1987 and in terms of Regulation 20 (3) of the KSRTC (Cadre and Recruitment) Regulations, 1982, the petitioner’s pay was ordered to be refixed in the pay scale applicable to the office attender and the difference if any in the basic pay was directed to be treated as personal pay. This action of the corporation came to be challenged before the court. 
The corporation defended its action stating that on downgrading of the cadre, the pay of the workman would have to be fixed as per the downgraded post and therefore, no fault can be found with the Road Transport Corporation. 
Further, the pay having been fixed in the year 2002 and the representation having been made in the year 2013, the petitioner could not have challenged after a period of nearly 11 years. Moreover, Section 47 of the Disabilities Act would require an application of Section 2(i) read with Section 2(t) of the Disabilities Act and it is only the disabilities which have been enumerated in Section 2(i), which can be taken into consideration for application of Section 47 of the Disabilities Act subject to however the percentage of disability as has been fixed under Section 2(t) of the Disabilities Act viz., 40%.
Referring to Section 47 of the Act the bench noted that it deals with non-discrimination in government employment and further mandates that no establishment shall dispense with or reduce in rank an employee who acquires a disability during his service. The first proviso makes it clear that if an employee were to acquire disability and is not suitable for the post that he was holding, he could be shifted to some other post with the same pay scale and service benefits. The second proviso makes it clear that if it is not possible to adjust the employee against any post, a supernumerary post would be created till he attains the age of superannuation or a suitable post is available, whichever is earlier.
It then said “Section 47 of the Disabilities Act categorically mandates that merely because a person suffers from disability, he/she shall not be reduced in rank but can only be shifted to another post subject to the pay-scale and the service benefit that he/she was entitled to as on that date being protected. Section 47, does not make any reference to Section 2 (t) or to a person with disability requiring the ascertainment of percentage of disability to be 40%.” 
Further, rejecting the submission of the Corporation that in terms of the Circular No.681 issued in 1987, it was entitled to downgrade the cadre as also to fix the pay-scale as per downgraded cadre, the bench held “Once the Act had come into force, the Road Transport Corporation could not have relied upon the Circular for that purpose.”
It added “It was but required for the Road Transport Corporation to make Section 47 of the Act applicable and once an employee’s cadre is downgraded and/or he is shifted to some other post, the pay-scale and service benefits as mandated under first proviso to Section 47 be protected.” 
Finally the court rejected the contention of the corporation that the downgrading to the attendant post was sought for by the petitioner himself and done on humanitarian grounds. 
The court said “The powers under regulation 20(3) of the Regulation can only be exercised in the event of the requirement under Section 2(t) of the Disabilities Act being fulfilled that is to say that the disability has to be 40% or more.” 
It said “In the event of the employee suffering from disability of 40% or more as a matter of right such an employee would be entitled for the benefit of Section 47 and for downgrading of the cadre without any adverse impact on the pay and the benefits.” 
Further it said “In the event of the disability being less than 40% then Section 2 (t) of the Disabilities Act not being applicable, such a person not being a person with disability, Regulation 20 (3) cannot be brought into force to downgrade the cadre of such an employee.” 
The court also suggested that whenever a request is made under Regulation 20(3), necessary instructions would have to be issued by the Road Transport Corporation to the Medical Board as also to the concerned employee that the certification of disability has to be obtained as on the date on which the request for downgrading of the cadre is made. 
It said “If no such information is conveyed to the Medical Board or to the employee and the Road Transport Corporation were to act on it, then subsequent thereto, the Road Transport Corporation cannot be heard to contend that the certificate of the Medical Board has to be on the date on which the application for downgrading has to be made.” 
Accordingly it allowed the petition.

Appearance: V S Naik, Advocate for petitioner.

The Himachal Pradesh High Court recently held that the power of Chief Justice under Article 229(2) is paramount in nature and once the Chief Justice takes a progressive step to ameliorate the service conditions of the Officers and staff working under him, the State Government cannot raise objections unless there were very good reasons.
The observations were made by a bench comprising Justices Tarlok Singh Chouhan and Sandeep Sharma while hearing a writ petition filed by Himachal Pradesh High Court, Non-Gazetted Employees/Official Employees Association in terms of which they sought directions upon the state government to bring parity in the pay scales of employees of the Himachal Pradesh High Court registry with their counterparts in Punjab and Haryana High Court.
In their plea, the petitioner Association argued that the State of Himachal Pradesh right from its inception had been following the State of Punjab insofar as the pay scales, allowances and other amenities are concerned.
Since the Government of India granted a hike of 20% in the existing pay to the employees serving in Punjab and Haryana High Court with effect from 01.01.2006, so, a similar provision should also be made for the employees of the Himachal Pradesh High Court as well, they prayed. 
The petitioner also brought to the notice of the bench that a representation on this subject had already been made to the High Court in 2012, which was considered and subsequently “recommended" to the State government by the High Court Chief Justice in the same year. 
The petitioners further pleaded that after a long halt the State authorities in year 2017 rejected the proposal submitted by the High Court mainly on the ground that the employees of the High Court had already been granted enhanced pay scales (Pay-Band and Grade Pay) with effect from 01.10.2012 at par with the pay scales of other State Government employees. Subsequently a meeting was held in 2019, where the government clearly refused to accede to the recommendations made by the Chief Justice, the petitioners added. 
Adjudicating upon the matter the division bench observed that Article 229 (3) of the Constitution of India contemplates that the administrative expenses of a High Court including salaries, allowances and pensions payable to or in respect of the officers and servants of the Court, shall be charged upon a Consolidated Fund of India with an objective to maintain the independence of the Judiciary.
Accordingly, when the Chief Justice, who is a very high dignitary of the State frames such rules, it should be looked upon with respect unless there are strong and cogent reasons for not approving, the court added. 
Deliberating further on the matter the bench recorded that the Chief Secretary to the State Government of Himachal Pradesh ought to have placed the recommendations of the Chief Justice before the Governor of Himachal Pradesh for approval on the principle of comity rather than filtering it on lower levels. 
Differentiating the nature of duties and responsibilities shouldered by the staff of the State Secretariat and the High Court are concerned, there is a vast difference.
"Unlike, the State Secretariat, the staff of the High Court have to strive hard to accomplish the given task....The duty hours of the staff of the High Court normally and invariably get stretched and extended to odd hours and they are more often than not required to work till late in the night," the court recorded. 
Elaborating further the court added that most of the work assigned to the staff of the High Court is required to be accomplished and/or completed in a time-bound manner and cannot be delayed. Therefore, taking into account the peculiar nature of work expected out of the staff of the Judiciary, the court held that fixation of same scale of pay to the staff of the State Secretariat and the staff of the High Court is not warranted, the bench underscored. 
Accordingly, the court set aside the decision of the state government whereby it refused to accede to the recommendations made by the High Court Chief Justice for a 20% hike in the existing pay scale of the high court employees. The bench further directed that the present judgment be placed before the Chief Justice to constitute a committee to assess the demands of the petitioner Association keeping in view the duties performed by the employees of the adjoining High Courts of Punjab and Haryana and Delhi before again recommending the demanded pay pattern.

The Allahabad High Court recently observed that an offence under Section 506 IPC (Punishment for criminal intimidation), if committed in the State of Uttar Pradesh is a cognizable offence.
To conclude thus, the Bench of Justice Subhash Vidyarthi referred to a notification published in the U.P. Gazette dated 31st July 1989, notifying the declaration made by the then Hon'ble Governor of UP that any offence punishable under Section 506 of the IPC when committed in Uttar Pradesh, shall be cognizable and non-bailable.
The Court also noted that the said notification had been upheld by a Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Meta Sewak Upadhyay versus State of U.P., 1995 CJ (All) 1158 and this decision was also approved by the Supreme Court in Aires Rodrigues versus Vishwajeet P. Rane (2017) 11 SCC 62.
The case in brief
Essentially, the informant/victim in the instant case moved an application under Section 156 (3) CrPC alleging that the applicant, one Rakesh Kumar Shukla had fired at him with the intention to kill him and when several persons from the locality gathered there, he went away threatening to kill the informant/victim.
Pursuant to the directions of the CJM, Banda, an FIR was lodged and the probe was conducted by the Police and a charge sheet was filed by the police in 2007 against the applicant, u/S 504 and 506 IPC, which is currently pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Banda.
Challenging this charge sheet, the Applicant (Rakesh Kumar Shukla) moved the Court with a 482 CrPC Application. 
It was primarily contended by the counsel for the applicant that originally the FIR was lodged under Sections 307, 504, 506 IPC but during investigation, the allegation of commission of offence under Section 307 IPC was found to be false and only a case under Sections 504 and 506 IPC was found to be made out against the applicant, both of which are non-cognizable offences and, therefore, it was argued by him that the case against the applicant can only proceed as a complaint case.
It may be noted that this argument was made by the applicant in consonance with Section 2 (d) of Cr.P.C, which states that a report made by a police officer in a case which discloses, after investigation, the commission of a non-cognizable offence shall be deemed to be a complaint.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court noted that although in the first schedule appended to the CrPC, Section 506 is mentioned to be a non-cognizable offence, the Uttar Pradesh Government, vide a Notification dated July 31, 1989, published in U.P. Gazette, made Section 506 IPC as cognizable and non-bailable.
Against this backdrop, the Court referred to Section 155 (4) of CrPC which states that where a case relates to two or more offences of which at least one is cognizable, the case shall be deemed to be a cognizable case, notwithstanding that the other offences are non-cognizable.
Applying the mandate of Section 155 (4) of CrPC to the instant set of facts, the Court concluded that since the applicant has been charged with the offences under Sections 504 and 506 IPC, one of which, i.e., the offence under Section 506 is a cognizable offence (as applicable in UP), the Case has to be treated as a cognizable one and has to be tried for both the offences in the manner prescribed for trial of cognizable offences.
With this, the application was rejected.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has ruled that the test to ascertain and uphold the fundamental right against "double jeopardy", which is guaranteed under Article 20(2) of the Constitution, is that whether the former offence and the offence now charged have the same ingredients in the sense that the facts constituting the one are sufficient to justify a conviction of the other and not that the facts relied on by the prosecution are the same in the two trials.
A single bench of Justice Sanjay Dhar was dealing with two petitions filed under section 482 CrPC seeking quashing of two complaints on the ground that the petitioner cannot be prosecuted twice on the basis of some set of facts as it would amount to double jeopardy.
 The record before the court revealed that the respondent-complainant had filed two separated complaints alleging offences under sec 138 NI Act before trial court Srinagar. The record also revealed that prior to the filing of the aforesaid two complaints, the respondent-complainant had also filed an application before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Budgam, pursuant to order passed by the said Court an FIR for offences under Section 420, 506 IPC of P/S, Budgam, came to be registered. It was also brought to the notice of the bench that the contents of the aforesaid FIR are identical to the impugned complaints and challan against the petitioner had been produced before the competent court wherein offences under Section 420 and 506 of IPC stand disclosed against the petitioner.
 In order to deal with the moot question as to whether a person can be prosecuted for offence under Section 420 of IPC as also for offence under Section 138 of NI Act on the same set of facts and whether or not it would amount to double jeopardy, the bench found it worthwhile to reproduce the observations of supreme court in Maqbool Hussain v. State of Bombay, AIR 1953 SC 325, wherein the constitutional bench of SC observed:
 "The fundamental right which is guaranteed under Article 20 (2) enunciates the principle of "autrefois convict" or "double jeopardy" i.e. a person must not be put in peril twice for the same offence . The test is whether the former offence and the offence now charged have the same ingredients in the sense that the facts constituting the one are sufficient to justify a conviction of the other and not that the facts relied on by the prosecution are the same in the two trials. A plea of "autrefois acquit" is not proved unless it is shown that the verdict of acquittal of the previous charge necessarily involves an acquittal of the latter."
 Applying the said ratio the court observed that it is clear that offences under Section 138 of the NI Act and Section 420 of IPC are distinct from each other because ingredients of the two offences are different. While in a prosecution under Section 138 of NI Act, fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of issuance of cheque need not be proved but in a prosecution under Section 420 of IPC, such intention is an important ingredient to be established, the bench underscored .
 The bench delving deep into the subject further recorded that for proving offence under Section 138 of NI Act, it has to be established that the cheque has been issued by the accused to discharge a legally enforceable debt or liability and the same has been dishonoured for insufficiency of funds etc. and despite receipt of statutory notice of demand, the accused has failed to pay the amount of cheque within the stipulated time. It is only when accused fails to make the payment within the stipulated time upon receipt of notice of demand that the offence under Section 138 of NI Act is made out against an accused. Therefore, the two offences are distinct from each other and the principle of double jeopardy or rule of estoppel does not come into play, the bench observed.
 Dismissing the petition the court stated that the mere fact of respondent-complainant had lodged an FIR, which has culminated in lodging of a challan against the petitioner containing allegations relating to the same transaction which is subject matter of the impugned complaints, does not make out a case of forum shopping or double jeopardy. The complainants are well within their rights to continue prosecution for both these offences i.e. offences under Section 138 of NI Act and Section 420 of IPC simultaneously, the bench concluded.
 Case Title: FAYAZ AHMAD SHEIKH Vs. MUSHTAQ AHMAD KHAN

The Punjab and Haryana High Court while denying anticipatory bail to the father in a case where he was allegedly acting in connivance with his son who solemnized various marriages without getting divorce from his disabled spouse, held that in view of the seriousness of the allegation and to unravel the truth, the custodial interrogation of the petitioner is necessary.
 Thus, in view of the seriousness of the allegation as also to unravel the truth regarding the multiple marriages of his son, the custodial interrogation of the petitioner is necessary. 
 The bench comprising Justice Jasjit Singh Bedi further added that the petitioner is a signatory to various documents which indicate him being aware of the multiple marriages of his son with different women.
 Apart from that, the court further noted that there are photographs of the petitioner at the different marriages of his son with different women.
 The complainant claimed that the Petitioner's son got married with his sister (80% disabled) in 2001 and out of the wedlock, two children were born. One of the child was 90% disabled. He alleged that the in-laws left his sister and children and the Petitioner's son solemnized five marriages without getting a divorce from his sister.
The complainant alleged that the actions were committed in connivance with the Petitioner, thereby cheating not only his sister but also other women.
After considering the fact that the daughter-in-law of the petitioner along with the grandson are physically disabled, the court concluded that in view of the seriousness of the allegation and to unravel the truth regarding the multiple marriages of the son of the petitioner, the custodial interrogation is necessary.
 Accordingly, his petition for the grant of concession of anticipatory bail is dismissed by the court.
 Case Title : Ajaib Singh v. State of Punjab

The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday observed that writing a letter to the husband's superior at work in good faith intimating him about a criminal case lodged against the husband for inflicting torture would not amount to criminal defamation under Section 499 of the IPC. 
In the instant case, the wife (petitioner) had written a letter dated May 24, 1997 to the Manager, Indian Overseas Bank intimating him that her husband who was the Assistant Manager of Overseas Bank had tortured her and driven her out of the matrimonial home and that a criminal case under Section 498A CrPC (cruelty) had been initiated against him following which he had been arrested and subsequently released on bail. The petitioner had enclosed a certified copy of the order and had requested the Manager to take such action as may be deemed fit under the facts and circumstances.
Justice Ananda Kumar Mukherjee noted that the petitioner in her letter had made representation of facts which were consistent with the incidents relating to filling of cases for alleged torture. He further opined that there had been no 'embellishment of facts' and that no coercive action had been sought by the petitioner against her husband vide the letter. 
"There remains little to be said that the letter in question was a statement of fact instead of any imputation to harm the reputation of the opposite party", the Court observed. 
Justice Mukherjee further noted that there was matrimonial discord between the petitioner and her husband to such an extent that the wife was compelled to leave her husband's home with her minor daughter.
Opining that it is obvious for the petitioner to take recourse to writing such a letter to her husband's superiors under such oppressive conditions, the Court remarked further, 
"This incident itself would heap insult and indignation upon a married lady having a child. Under such oppressive conditions it is only obvious that the petitioner would take recourse to writing such letter to Official Heads of the opposite party. The petitioner wife cannot be faulted for taking recourse to law of the land for protection of herself and her daughter. She should have her right to ventilate her grievance as her human dignity was at peril."
Opining further that the the ingredients of offence of defamation are not attracted by the contents of the letter as they are covered by the Eighth Exception laid down under Section 499 IPC, the Court underscored,
"..preferring an accusation against any person to any of the persons who have lawful authority over that person, would not amount to defamation. In the instant case the petitioner wife made accusation against the opposite party before his superior in office in good faith and consistent to her accusation made in the petition of complaint. Therefore, the same would not amount to any defamation as the same is excepted in the 8th exception."
It was also noted that any representation made by a person in good faith for protecting his/her own interest would not amount to defamation as the Ninth Exception under Section 499 IPC protects imputations made in good faith by person for protection of his or other's interests. 
The Court further observed that the Fifth Exception under Section 499 IPC stipulates that a representation would not amount to defamation if an opinion is expressed on the merits of any case in good faith which has been decided by a Court in respect of the conduct of a person.
"In the instant case on the basis of the material available in the Case Diary the bail of the opposite party was rejected by the court. Therefore, subsequent acquittal of the opposite party cannot undo his arrest and his released on bail by the court, therefore such representation when made in the letter would be covered by the 5th exception of section 499 of IPC", the Court remarked further. 
It was further taken into consideration that the letter had been addressed to the husband's superiors on May 24, 1997 whereas the complaint had been filed by the husband against the petitioner for criminal defamation only on June 8, 2009 that is twelve long years after the cause of action arose.
It was further held that the complaint filed under Section 200 CrPC by the husband against the petitioner alleging the offence of criminal defamation is barred by the law of limitation under Section 468 CrPC. Pursuant to Section 469(1)(a) of the CrPC, the period of limitation for taking cognizance in an offence under section 500 of IPC is three years from the date of its initiation.
Accordingly, the Court observed that case initiated by the husband is barred by limitation as the date of offence should be construed from the date of issuing the letter, that is on May 24, 1997. Placing reliance on the Allahabad High Court decision in Naresh Chand Jain Vs. State of U.P and others and on the Calcutta High Court judgment in Rabindra Nath Pal v. Ratikanta Paul & others the Court opined that a case for the offence of defamation should be filed within three years from the date of publication. 
Thus, the Court set aside the complaint lodged by the husband against the petitioner for the offence of defamation by observing that the same is barred by limitation and thus a continuation of such proceedings would lead to an abuse of the process of Court.
Case Title: Malancha Mohinta v. Dipak Mohinta

Coming to the aid of Old Delhi's popular Mughlai food outlet "Karim's", the Delhi High Court has restrained Mumbai based businessman Kareem Dhanani from opening any further restaurants under deceptively similar marks, till August 8.
Justice Prathibha M. Singh further directed Dhanani to ensure that in the restaurants run by him or by his franchises, no representation is made to the customers that it is associated with the Karim's at Jama Masjid.
The order released on Monday further stated,
"At least two public notices shall be issued in prominent newspapers having circulation in Maharashtra and in North India, that the Defendant's restaurant KAREEM'S is not associated with the Plaintiff's - KARIM HOTEL PVT LTD or KARIM/KARIM'S/KAREEM Restaurant from Jama Masjid or Delhi. The said notices shall be published by the next date. All the advertisements and promotional materials, menu cards, etc. including all promotions on social media and online platforms, shall carry a prominent disclaimer to the following effect: "No connection with KARIM'S Jama Masjid/Delhi"."
The development comes in a trademark infringement suit filed by Delhi-based Karim's stated to be running since 1913. Dhanani himself is running 41 restaurants, including 3 international outlets at Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Canada. He admittedly adopted the trade name "Kareem's" in 2003.
Thus, the Court noted that Dhanani adopted the impugned mark almost 90 years after the Plaintiff's adoption. 
"Considering the fact that the Plaintiff is the prior user, adopter and owner of the marks "KARIM/KARIM'S/KARIMS", the continued use of the said mark by the Defendant would result in passing off and deception. However, the Defendant having opened 41 restaurants already as per the listset out above, this Court is of the opinion that a balance would have to be struck so as to ensure that neither party is prejudiced irreparably. Owing to the long adoption of the Plaintiff's marks "KARIM/KARIM'S/KARIMS" and the goodwill and reputation which the Plaintiff's restaurants enjoy, not only in India but internationally," the Court said
 The plaintiff claimed that they came to now of the defendant's mark in 2014. At that stage, the Plaintiff initially issued a legal notice on 25th February, 2015 which was replied to by the Defendant on 11th March, 2015. The Plaintiff also filed a suit titled Karim Hotels Pvt. Ltd. v. Karims A. Dhanani, against the Defendant. In the said suit, the Defendant took a plea that it has a registration dated 4th February, 2005 for the device mark/logo "KARIMS'S" bearing. Considering the said registration, the Plaintiff had filed a petition seeking cancellation of the Defendant's mark before the IPAB, Mumbai.
 The following order was passed in the aforesaid suit:
 "The plaintiff has filed a proceeding before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (for short 'IPAB') for cancellation of the defendant's mark. Present suit is being repeatedly adjourned since 17th February, 2016 to await the outcome of the IPAB. This Court is of the opinion that no fruitful purpose would be served by repeatedly adjourning the present suit as not only the proceedings before the IPAB are bound to take time, but any order passed by the IPAB may be challenged by either of the parties. Consequently, the present suit and pending applications are disposed of with liberty to the plaintiffs to file an appropriate proceeding after the IPAB has disposed of the proceeding for Cancellation of the defendant's mark and the said order has attained finality. The rights and contentions of all parties are left open."
 In the present suit, the plaintiff submitted that the Defendant now has large number of franchisees in various cities. There is enormous confusion being caused between the Plaintiff's and the Defendant's restaurants. The mark of the Plaintiff is also being diluted. Further the Court was informed that the cancellation petition which was filed before the IPAB is still pending and no proceedings have taken place.
 Considering the aforesaid circumstances, the Court granted interim relief to the Plaintiff and directed the Respondent to place on record his written statement/reply by 5th July, along with copies of the franchise agreements entered into by him with his various franchisees.
The matter will now be taken up on 8 August. Both parties have been asked to remain present on the said date to explore amicable resolution.

The Allahabad High Court recently denied bail to a man who has been accused of running a fake lottery to dupe Indian nationals and sending the money to handlers in Pakistan.
The Bench of Justice Krishan Pahal opined that even though the provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act have not been initiated against the bail-applicant, prakash, however, since the matter pertains to national security and therefore, it is not a fit case for bail.
The Case in brief
Essentially, the bail applicant had been booked under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 of the Indian Penal Code after it was found in the police probe that he was in touch with Pakistani nationals, who are involved in a racket of running fake lotteries in India.
Thereafter, the bail applicant was apprehended along with another man, and 30 ATM cards, a Driving Licence, Rs.2500/- cash, three mobile phones, and one Samsung tablet were recovered from his possession. 
Allegedly, both of them confessed that they are involved in duping the Indian nationals by opening fake accounts thereby facilitating the Pakistani nationals in using the said account.
It was further alleged that he used to open fake accounts on the basis of forged documents and asked the Indian nationals to deposit their money in the said fake accounts on the pretext of getting lottery and after deducting their commissions, the accused persons transferred the remaining amount to the accounts of Pakistani handlers.
Opposing his bail plea, the State's counsel argued that it had been proved that many account numbers and cash deposit receipts have been sent to Pakistan through Whatsapp. He also referred to statements of various persons who have been duped by the said nexus run by the applicant and the co-accused Dhiruddin Chaudhary with Pakistani nationals. 
It was further submitted that the evidence collected during the investigation categorically establishes the offences and the activity of the accused applicant with the handlers sitting in Pakistan and that the charge-sheet against the applicant had been filed for the offences u/s 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B IPC and further investigation of the case is still in progress.
Lastly, it was told to the Court that the data analysis of mobile numbers had revealed the details of the Whatsapp chatting and audio clips with the handlers sitting in Pakistan wherein 81 bank deposit receipts have also been sent to Pakistani handlers as proof of deposit. 
Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the number of articles recovered from the possession of the applicant and also the evidence placed on record as well as the submissions advanced by the counsel for the parties, the Court was of the view that since the matter pertains to national security have not been initiated against the applicant as yet, the Court didn't find it a fit case for bail.

The Allahabad High Court last week directed the Secretary, District Legal Services Authority, Bahraich to take requisite steps to provide compensation to a 12-year-old Rape survivor whose unwanted pregnancy was terminated earlier this month as per HC's order.
The bench of Justice Attau Rahman Masoodi and Justice Om Prakash Shukla has further asked the Secretary, DLSA to take up the matter with the district authorities and submit a report to the Senior Registrar of thE Court as to the outcome of such efforts taken for the payment of compensation to the victim or her family as per the prevailing scheme i.e. U.P. Victim Compensation Scheme, 2014.
The Court was essentially dealing with the case of the 12-year-old Girl who was raped in April 2022, however, due to fear, she didn't disclose anything about the incident to anyone. Thereafter, in August 2022, she finally narrated the entire story to her parents and thus, an FIR was lodged and the accused was arrested.
Thereafter, she moved a representation before the concerned authorities of her home district (Bahraich), however, no substantial action was taken and thus, the father of the victim moved to the High Court with the instant writ plea seeking the termination of her unwanted pregnancy. 
The Allahabad High Court on September 13, allowed the Writ Petition that was filed before it to terminate the 24-week-old pregnancy of a 12-year-old rape survivor.
Keeping in view the report of the medical board, the bench of Justice Attau Rahman Masoodi and Justice Om Prakash Shukla permitted the medical experts to proceed with the challenge of terminating the pregnancy in the interest of justice.
After the termination of her pregnancy, the victim was discharged from the Hospital and she is currently under the guardianship of her natural parents. Now, on September 20, the Counsel of the victim's father pressed the prayer for rehabilitation of the victim. 
It was submitted that the government has also evolved a scheme whereunder the victims of rape have been provided financial support so that they lead a normal life like ordinary citizens. It was informed that the victim is going through a vulnerable situation and is dependent on all sorts of help including legal services to claim the benefit of the scheme applicable in this behalf.
In view of this, the Court disposed of the plea by issuing the following direction:
"Accordingly, we hereby direct the Secretary, District Legal Services Authority, Bahraich to ensure all the necessary legal assistance and help to the victim and ensure that the claim for compensation as per the prevailing scheme i.e. U.P. Victim Compensation Scheme, 2014 as amended from time to time is provided to the petitioner without any delay. All the requisite steps for the payment of compensation shall be taken by the Secretary, District Legal Services Authority, Bahraich expeditiously."
Case title - Ms. X Thru. Her Legal Guardian Bharat Lal v. State Of U.P. Thru. Prin. Secy. Deptt. Of Home Civil Secrt. Lko. And Others [WRIT - C No. - 6102 of 2022]

The Kerala High Court has held that the condition mandating applicants to clear CLAT for applying to the post of Assistant Law Officer in National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) was violative of Article 16 of the Constitution of India.
However, to avoid upsetting the entire selection process, Justice V.G. Arun directed the respondents to accept the petitioner's application and test her eligibility through a selection process. 
"Ext.P3 notification insofar as it confines the selection process to only candidates who had participated in the CLAT-2021 PG programme, violates Article 16 of the Constitution of India. Having held so, rather than upsetting the whole selection process, I deem it more appropriate to direct the second respondent to accept the petitioner's application and conduct a selection test or interview for testing her eligibility for appointment to the notified post. Further action with respect to the appointment shall be taken depending on the outcome of such selection test/interview."
The Court was adjudicating upon a plea moved by an aspirant to the post of Assistant Law Officer in NTPC and an LL.M student at CUSAT with a specialization in Intellectual Property Rights. She completed LLB with an average score of 70% and claims to have several academic accolades to her account, therefore eligible to apply for the post of Assistant Law Officer at NTPC.
However, the notification issued by the Corporation mandates that the candidate must have appeared for CLAT-2021 to be considered for the post and that they will be shortlisted based on the rankings in the said examination. 
Appearing for the petitioner, Advocate Maitreyi S. Hegde submitted that being a public sector undertaking falling within the definition of Article 12 of the Constitution, the NTPC cannot shut out the chances of persons like the petitioner, merely for the reason that she is pursuing her Post Graduation programme in a University that is not part of the consortium of National Law Universities. 
It was further argued that there is no nexus between the objective sought to be achieved by imposing such a condition since CLAT exam is meant for assessing the academic brilliance of students, whereas the NTPC is seeking to select the best among legal professionals.
On the other hand, SG Tushar Mehta submitted that fixing the eligibility criteria for appointment to a particular post is the absolute prerogative of the employer. He added that CLAT is a national-level examination conducted by the Consortium of National Universities for filtering and selecting the brightest students. Being convinced of the standard of law graduates selected through CLAT PG programmes, not only the NTPC, but various other PSUs are following the same process.
The Court agreed that fixing the eligibility of a particular post is within the domain of the employer and cannot be the subject matter of judicial review, unless found to be arbitrary, unreasonable or having no rational nexus to the objective sought to be achieved. However, in this case, the challenge was not against qualification or eligibility, but the selection process - that incorporation of the restrictive selection criteria was indirect discrimination.
The Judge pointed out that out of the 1721 law colleges in India, only 23 are members of the Consortium of National Law Universities. The argument that graduates from other law colleges would also have appeared for the CLAT-PG cannot also be countenanced, since such candidates would only be a minuscule minority. Further, it was emphasised that the selection is based on a test conducted much prior to the issuance of the notification. 
As contended by the petitioner, law graduates aspiring to be appointed in public sector undertakings cannot be expected to appear for an admission test anticipating that in future that test will be made the criterion for selection to PSUs. Further, even candidates who had appeared for the previous year's CLAT PG and performed well were not eligible. 
Therefore, it was held that the notification confining the selection process only to candidates who had appeared for the CLAT-2021 PG programme amounts to indirect discrimination. 
The Judge also found that the focus of the test was on academics and not on assessment of the skill set expected of  future law officers. Hence, the selection process indeed had no rational nexus with the objective. 
"Even if the argument that students graduating from NLUs acquire more skill and knowledge than their less fortunate brethren is accepted, that is no reason to deny a level playing field to the others. There is no logical basis for the assumption that professionalism and competence is the fiefdom of only those passing from elite institutions. The process now adopted is more like a walkover to the finals for a chosen few, without competing in the preliminaries."
The Court added that the respondents' argument that it is inexpedient to conduct a selection test across India for filling up ten posts also fails when tested on the touchstone of Article 16. 
"As long as the Constitution guarantees equality of opportunity to the citizens, the State and its instrumentalities have a corresponding duty to ensure such opportunity to all."
As such, the respondents were directed to conduct a selection process for the petitioner within one month.

The Calcutta High Court observed that a magistrate cannot dismiss an application under Section 156(3) of Criminal Procedure Code merely on the ground of delay in lodging complaint.
The magistrate cannot draw an inference that because of delay of lodging complaint it could be inferred that the application could not be treated as FIR on the ground of inordinate delay, Justice Bibek Chaudhuri observed.
The court added that there is no direction in the Supreme Court judgment in Lalita Kumari case to throw an application away under Section 156(3) of the Code on the ground of delay without sending it to the police authority for either preliminary inquiry or investigation treating the same as FIR.
In this case, the Magistrate had rejected an application under Section 156(3) of the Code predominantly on the ground that there was abnormal delay in alleging of the FIR in initiating criminal procedure.  The magistrate noted that the alleged incident took place on 29th November, 2018 and the petitioner lodged the complaint after elapse of about two years on 12th November, 2020, and that the explanation of delay in lodging such complaint was not satisfactory and convincing.
It was contended before the court that the Supreme Court judgment in Lalita Kumari (supra) never empowers the Magistrate to outright dismiss an application under Section 156(3) of the Code on the ground of delay. Agreeing with the same, the court observed:
18. It is needless to say that unexplained delay in lodging complaint in most of the times proves fatal for the prosecution. At the same time, there are plethora of decisions of the Apex Court where it is held that in a case of sexual assault and rape delay in lodging FIR by itself is not a ground to discard the written complaint. The delay in lodging FIR is not of much significance as the victim has to muster courage to come out in open and express herself in a conservative social milieu. In cases of rape, the delay in filing FIR by the prosecutrix in all circumstance is not of significance. Sometimes the fear of social stigma and on some occasions fear from the accused persons that she may be subjected to further assault of like nature and absence of physiological inner strength to undertake a legal battle against the man of money, muscle and power are the reasons for delay in lodging complaint.
The court also disagreed with a single bench judgment in Mukul Roy vs. State of West Bengal (2019) Cri.L.J 245 (Cal) that observed that the Magistrate shall verify the truth and veracity of the allegations, record being had to the nature of the allegations of the case. 
"With all humiliation and greatest respect to the Hon'ble Judge the said direction is not in conformity with the direction made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari (supra) in Paragraph 120.5 of Lalita Kumari, the Hon'ble Single Judge clearly directs that the scope of preliminary inquiry is not to verify the veracity or otherwise of the information received, but only to ascertain whether the information reveals any cognizable offence. When the police authority in case of preliminary inquiry prior to the registration of a case concerning cognizable offence is not entitled to verify the veracity, how would a Magistrate be able to verify the truth and veracity of the allegations contained in the application under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. In view of what has been stated above and applying the ratio of Lalilta Kumari, this court holds that sub paragraph (4) of Mukul Roy's case is not a correct guideline to be followed by the Magistrate while dealing with an application under Section 156(3) of the Code."
The court said that upon receiving an application under Section 156(3) of the Code two alternative courses of action are open to the Magistrate. 
1. The Magistrate can under Section 190 of the Code, before taking cognizance ask for investigation by police under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. 
2.  If the Magistrate thinks fit he can take cognizance upon the petition of complaint and follow the procedure contained in Section 202 of the Code. 
Setting aside the Magistrate's dismissal order, the court observed: 
28. Before I part with, I am tempted to mention the effect of delay in lodging FIR. In a criminal case the FIR is the earliest statement of commission of a cognizable offence. It is not a substantive piece of evidence and it can be used in trial either for corroboration or contradiction. Delay in lodging complaint is treated as a ground of false narration of the incident, embellishment and suppression of material fact. 29. All such points are to be decided by the Court during the trial of a case. While dealing with an application under Section 156(3) of the Code, the Magistrate cannot decide the effect of delay in lodging complaint. Lalita Kumari empowers the police authority to conduct preliminary inquiry over inordinate delay in lodging the complaint. The Supreme Court never directs in Lalita Kumari to throw an application away under Section 156(3) of the Code on the ground of delay without sending it to the police authority for either preliminary inquiry or investigation treating the same as FIR.
 

While quashing a lower court's order canceling the bail of a murder accused, the Punjab and Haryana High Court last week observed that the imprisonment of the accused before his/her conviction becomes a sort of punishment in view of abysmally low rate of conviction in our country.
The bench of Justice Jagmohan Bansal also observed that life of every human being is most precious gift of God and everyone has very limited span of life which cannot be spoiled on account of incompetence, personal grudge, vengeance of someone; or brutal, illegal, unethical action of the State machinery.
"Except habitual offender, commoners living simple life after arrest lose self-respect and confidence within himself as well State. It has become very common to put criminal law in motion even though dispute involved is purely contractual or civil in nature. Many times arrest entails deprivation of source of income of entire family besides forever stigma in a closely knit society like ours," the Court further remarked.
Significantly, the Court also said that there is neither mechanism to compensate a man who is later on found innocent nor acquittal can return valuable time, energy, status, future of family members especially children which is lost on account of incarceration of bread earner of the family.
These observation were made by the Court while dealing with the plea moved by Harinder Singh @ Harry (booked under Section 365 IPC, 302, 328, 201 r/w 34 IPC and Section 21 of NDPS Act), seeking quashing of an order of the Additional Sessions Judge, Ludhiana whereby bail bonds furnished by him were cancelled and non-bailable warrants of arrest were issued against him.
It was his primary submission that the an FIR was registered against him in 2017 in the matter, and in May this year, he got a bail order from the High Court, however, due to his non-appearance in the Ludhiana trial court, the court issued non-bailable warrants against him. He also submitted that he is ready to appear in the trial court on the next hearing.
Against this backdop, and noting that the object of cancellation of bond or declaration of anyone as proclaimed offender/person is to secure his presence and that the petitioner had himself come forward to face trial and undertook to appear before trial court on each and every date, the Court went ahead to allow his petition.
The Court directed him to appear before Trial Court on December 9, 2022 and furnish fresh bail bond/surety bond to its satisfaction. However, a cost of Rs. 10,000/- was imposed upon him to be paid to the District Legal Services Authority, Ludhiana for wasting valuable time and energy of courts as well prosecution.

The Gujarat High Court recently quashed proceedings for the offence of dowry harassment against a distant relative of the complainant's husband, observing that no specific incidents were alleged in the entire FIR and the allegation against him was purely "general in nature".
"Considering the fact that the applicant happens to be the distant relative of the husband of the complainant, it seems that the impugned order is nothing but an attempt to falsely implicate the applicant as accused just with a view to harass the applicant. The allegation against the applicant is purely of general in nature and considering the fact that the applicant stays at a different place, the registration of impugned FIR against the applicant is nothing but an abuse of process of law," Justice Nirzar Desai said.
The FIR was lodged under Sections 498A (Cruelty in matrimonial home), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), and 506(2) (criminal intimidation to cause death or grievous hurt) of IPC and Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.
 It was alleged that the Applicant used to taunt the complainant that she got married by 'cheating' and that she had not brought anything which would suit the reputation of the family of the husband in the society. The Complainant insisted that because of the pendency of the instant application, the IO was not filing a chargesheet against the Husband against whom there was material.
The High Court however noted that in the entire FIR, there was only one sentence against the Applicant about taunting her and the prosecution had failed to supply any material against him.
 Thus, the Bench concluded that such allegations in the impugned FIR amount to 'abuse of process of law' and consequently, the same was set aside qua the Applicant.

In the recent judgement, the Supreme Court through a three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice N.V. Ramana, Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli upheld an important position of law pertaining to Dowry Death and the presumption of guilt in cases relating to it. The ingredients of Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code and Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act have been explained. The court also placed reliance in the proximity test laid down in the landmark case of Maya Devi and Anr. V. State of Haryana (2015) 17 SCC 405.
 The judgement authored by Justice Hima Kohli notes that in order to meet the applicability of Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code, the following pre-requisites must be met:
 "(i) that the death of a woman must have been caused by burns or bodily injury or occurred otherwise than under normal circumstance;
 (ii) that such a death must have occurred within a period of seven years of her marriage;
 (iii) that the woman must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment at the hands of her husband, soon before her death; and
 (iv) that such a cruelty or harassment must have been for or related to any demand for dowry."
 The court also notes that Section 304B IPC read in conjunction with Section 113B of the Evidence Act leaves no manner of doubt that once the prosecution has been able to demonstrate that a woman has been subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any demand for dowry, soon before her death, the Court shall proceed on a presumption that the persons who have subjected her to cruelty or harassment in connection with the demand for dowry, have caused a dowry death within the meaning of Section 304B IPC.
 Factual Background
 The deceased in this case is contended to have been killed by her in-laws in relation to the demand of dowry. The deceased had been married to the husband accused for a few months and there had been multiple witnesses before the court who testified that she was subject to the demand of dowry and her in-laws even threatened her that if she does not bring the dowry demanded, her husband shall be remarried to someone else. On one day, the deceased went missing and seven days later her body was recovered from a waterbody with no ante mortem injuries. 
 The court heard two appeals together in this case. The first appeal has been brought by the mother-in-law of the deceased and the second appeal has been brought by the husband of the deceased. On September 20, 1999 the Trial Court convicted both the appellants under Sections 304B and 201 read with Section 34 if the IPC and sentenced them to a rigorous imprisonment of ten years and three years respectively on each count with both the sentences running concurrently. The High Court in its impugned judgement upheld the decision of the Trial Court.
 Arguments by the Counsels 
 The counsel for the appellant failed to provide a plausible explanation as to her disappearance. An argument was made that the body recovered from the waterbody was unidentifiable however the father of the deceased recognized it on the basis of the clothes worn and some part of the face remaining intact. Another argument was made that the accused was working in Kolkata during the time the incident took place, however the same could not be proved before the court.
 The prosecution's case was well established against the husband accused through the testimony of multiple witnesses. No eye witnessed were produced before the court however the circumstantial evidence had been corroborated to prove the guilt of the accused.
 The Court after having heard both the parties came to the conclusion that the evidence against the accused had been corroborated to establish the prosecution's case well. The Court referred to the case of Bansi Lal v. State of Haryana (2011) 11 SCC 359 wherein it was stated that- "While considering the case under Section 498-A (Sic. Section 304-B), cruelty has to be proved during the close proximity of time of death and it should be continuous and such continuous harassment, physical or mental, by the accused should make life of the deceased miserable which may force her to commit suicide." The Court also placed reliance on the case of Maya Devi and Anr. V. State of Haryana (2015) 17 SCC 405 where it was held that- "To attract the provisions of Section 304-B, one of the main ingredients of the offence which is required to be established is that "soon before her death" she was subjected to cruelty or harassment "for, or in connection with the demand for dowry". The expression "soon before her death" used in Section 304-IPC and Section 113-B of the Evidence Act is present with the idea of proximity test. However, the said expression would normally imply that the interval should not be much between the cruelty or harassment concerned and the death in question. In other words, there must be existence of a proximate and live link between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demand and the death concerned. If the alleged incident of cruelty is remote in time and has become stale enough not to disturb the mental equilibrium of the women concerned, it would be of no consequence."
 In the judgement, the court emphasizes that the expression "soon before her death" used in Section 304-IPC and Section 113-B of the Evidence Act is present with the idea of proximity test which does not define any particular time period and must be applied on a case-to-case basis. Further, elaborating on the presumption raised under Section 304B of IPC, the Court states:
 "Section 304B IPC read in conjunction with Section 113B of the Evidence Act leaves no manner of doubt that once the prosecution has been able to demonstrate that a woman has been subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any demand for dowry, soon before her death, the Court shall proceed on a presumption that the persons who have subjected her to cruelty or harassment in connection with the demand for dowry, have caused a dowry death within the meaning of Section 304B IPC. The said presumption is, however, rebuttable and can be dispelled on the accused being able to demonstrate through cogent evidence that all the ingredients of Section 304B IPC have not been satisfied." (Para 17)
 The Court noted that the presumption of dowry death is raised in this case since the victim had gone missing from her matrimonial home within a few months of her marriage and immediately after demands of dowry were made on her and that her death had occurred under abnormal circumstances. Since the appellants have not been able to satisfy the presumption raised against them, the Court came to the conclusion that all the ingredients of Section 304B IPC have been met against the accused husband despite the prosecution's case resting solely on circumstantial evidence. 
  The Court concluded that the impugned judgement and order of sentence imposed on him is maintainable. For the accused mother-in-law the court came to the conclusion that no specific allegations had been made against her, nor any specific evidence or testimony pointed the guilt towards her. The court accordingly allowed her appeal and ordered for her release.

 Coram: Justices N.V.Ramana, Surya Kant and Hima Kohli.

The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, called upon all the State Governments to issue directions to the jail authorities to submit certain particulars of under trial prisoners who have been granted bail, but are still in prison as they were unable to meet bail conditions. A Bench led by Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and A.S. Oka categorically asked for the following information in a chart -
Name of detenu;Offence under which they were charged;Date when bail was granted;Bail conditions that were not met;How long has the period been since the bail was granted; and Date of bail order. 
The Bench asked the State Governments to ensure that the requisite information is made available to them by the jail authorities within a period of 15 days. Thereafter, within a week, the State Governments are to forward the data to NALSA, that would make suggestions wherever necessary and would also render legal assistance to the detenues. 
While the Bench was considering a batch of petitions of life convicts in jail whose appeals are pending before various High Courts, Justice Kaul reckoned that there are several cases where even after being granted bail the detenues are languishing in jail merely because they cannot fulfil the bail conditions - 
"One issue that was brought to my notice….there are several cases where bail had been granted but people had not been able to comply with the terms and conditions of the bail."
To get a realistic estimate of the numbers of such cases, the Bench passed the above-indicated order. 
The Amicus Curiae apprised the Bench that the Delhi Legal Services Authority (DLSA) had already flagged the issue. He added that DLSA has proposed something with respect to furnishing of bail bonds for those who are unable to do so even when they are granted bail. 
Justice Kaul was of the opinion, "In Delhi, I think the number of such cases may be less. The problem is going to be more in States where financial means become a challenge." 
Justice Oka highlighted that the only way to solve the issue might be to seek modification of the bail conditions which could not be met by the detenues. He indicated that in each case, an application for such modification has to be filed. Therefore, the collection of data of the number of such cases becomes crucial. 
Justice Oka also pointed out that Tata Institute for Social Sciences is carrying out a similar exercise as proposed by DLSA. In view of the same, the Bench recorded in the order that NALSA may take the assistance of TISS for effectuating the execution of bail orders. 
During the course of the hearing, the Amicus submitted that Karnataka Legal Services Authority had informed that the E-prison module has been implemented in all 52 prisons in Karnataka. He suggested if the same can be implemented by the other States. Considering his suggestion, the Bench noted - 
"'Legal Aid Information Module' was not enabled in Karnataka Prison…The steps taken - meeting held with NALSA…has produced a result. The E-Prison Module having some important features would enable effective monitoring. That in the E-Prison portal is to be updated accordingly. The solution from the Amicus is that this should be implemented across the country with coordination between SLSA and prison authorities. Be completed within a period of two months."
The Bench also recorded the suggestion that the E-prison module can be modified to reflect some crucial court-data such as orders granting bail, status of implementation of bail orders etc. 
"One of the suggestions is that the E-prison module can be modified for uploading data regarding orders granting bail; status of implementation of the orders granting bail and orders of acquittal."
Yesterday, another bench of the Supreme Court, while considering another case, had directed the States to give information regarding bail orders which are remaining unexecuted.

Code of Criminal Procedure- Section 439- Prisoners in jail despite getting bail as they can't fulfil conditions- Supreme Court directs States to furnish data of undertrial prisoners who remain in bail as they can't satisfy surety or comply with other conditions

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has reiterated that once a person enters into wedlock and decides to raise a family, he cannot turn around and say that he is not ready to perform his moral and legal obligation flowing out of the wedlock as he is in no mood to earn livelihood.
 A bench of Justice Vinod Chatterji Koul relied on Vikram Jamwal v. Geetanjali Rajput and another (2010) 1 JKJ 236 and observed,
 "It is for the person to decide to marry or not to marry, but once a person decides to marry, he is duty bound to perform all the duties and discharge all obligations that the society and law expect and require him to discharge".
 The bench was hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had challenged the order of Principal Sessions Judge as a Revisional Court, upholding the order passed by the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate which awarded maintenance to his wife and daughter (living separately from him).
 The petitioner argued that the impugned mechanically fixed quantum of maintenance at an exorbitant rate without taking into consideration his liabilities, which after making all necessary deductions is around Rs. 12000/- only. He also submitted that he is ready to take care of their expenses, provided they join his company.
 Adjudicating upon the matter, Justice Koul observed that it is settled law that the nature of duty cast on a person to maintain his wife, child/children and parents that sufficient means has been interpreted to include capacity to earn and as long as a person is able bodied with capacity to earn, he cannot escape his legal duty to maintain his wife, children and parents, who are unable to maintain themselves, on the ground that he does not actually have any income.
 The Court also noted that the Petitioner had himself refused to take the respondents back and thus, they have sufficient ground for residing separately from the petitioner.
 Accordingly, the petition was found without any merit and was accordingly dismissed.

"'Even a protector needs protection and safety' and its time that Government must take effective measures and steps ensure good health and safety of the Police personnel's"
 Former Assistant Commissioner of Police, Mr. Bhanupratap Barge has moved the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the Central Government to make provisions for payment of 'risk and hardship' allowance to the police officers who are serving on the frontline amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The Petitioner, through Advocate Pai Amit, has submitted that the concept of "Risk and Hardship Allowance" is not a novel one and should be put to use to aid the Police officers who are working over-time in hazardous conditions for enforcing the lockdown.
Petitioner has also sought that the circulars whereby several state governments have announced to deduct the salaries of the police personnel should be withdrawn forthwith.
 The plea states that working at the frontline has made police officers and their families more vulnerable to contracting COVID 19. In fact, it submitted that there have been various reports of the police personnel who are contracting COVID 19 and several officers have even died in Madhya Pradesh.
 "It is submitted that by the very nature of their work, not only are police G personnel but also their respective families are at risk of contracting COVID 19. The police personnel are also coming under tremendous stress and no steps are taken for their mental well being. The present petition is being filed to ensure that the morale of the police personnel is boosted with incentives, especially due to the current COVID 19 situation," the Petitioner submitted.
 The Petitioner bats for incentives for police officers in the form of bonuses and additional salary, so as to boost their morale and enable them to support their families, especially in those areas that have been declared containment areas/ hotspots.
 He submitted that the Government is obligated to protect the rights of the police personnel under Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution. "The Respondents have also a duty to, not only provide incentives to the police personnel, but also to ensure that they are incentivised for the additional duty of ensuring the proper implementation of the lockdown," he remarked.
 In addition to this, the Petitioner has sought that the police personnel who are above the age of 48 years and suffer from any sort of medical conditions should be not deployed in hazardous working environment, due to their being more vulnerable to the infection.
 "As per WHO guidelines older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 hence such officer above 48 years with above medical conditions be not deployed in any stressful working environment which comes in direct contact with COVID-19 patients.
 It is submitted that as per the reports published in various news paper the officials who have died are above 50 years of age. The Petitioner in this regard seeks urgent interim directions to State to identify such police officials and exempt them from COVID-19 related duties and be put on any administrative work which has no or limited exertion," the Petitioner submitted.
 Further, to address the serious shortage of police personnel and the fact that police personnel are also contracting COVID 19, the Petitioner has submitted that it is quintessential for the Government to recruit a few persons on ad hoc basis, to man the law and order situation.
 "The present petition is being filed seeking further direction to all the State Governments to, on ad hoc basis recruit persons who are physically fit, to ensure that the police officials are not burdened," the plea states.
 Inter alia, the plea has sought apposite directions to the Government to ensure adequate supply of protective gears such as masks, gloves and sanitizers for police personnel's, at priority.
 Lastly, the Petitioner has sought that the circulars whereby several state governments have announced to deduct the salaries of the police personnel should be withdrawn forthwith.
 "Although some State viz State of Haryana and State of Telangana have sought to encourage and appreciate the efforts of the Police personnel's by paying them double salary, at the same time other States have, infact, in a way penalised the officers by deducting E their salaries upto 25% to 35% which is detriment to the interest and moral of several officers who are on field trying to contain this deadly virus which has taken several lives across the Globe," the Petitioner submitted.
The Petition has been filed through Advocates Rajesh Inamdar, Amit Pai and Sailesh Mhaske

The Allahabad High Court on Monday stayed the proceedings of a 2014 criminal case against the Chief Minister of Delhi and National Convener of Aam Admi Party (AAP), Arvind Kejriwal, pending before the MP/MLA Court in the state's Sultanpur District.
The bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh ordered thus while hearing a Section 482 CrPC plea filed by Kejriwal challenging the order of the MP/MLA Court framing charges against him and posted the matter for further hearing on January 13, 2023.
The FIR in the case was lodged against Kejriwal in the year 2014 during the general elections for allegedly making false statements during elections (Section 171G IPC), obstructing public servants from discharging their duty (Section 186 IPC), wrongfully restraining persons (section 341 IPC), assaulting public servants to deter them from doing their duty (Section 353 IPC) besides others.
The counsel appearing for Kejriwal submitted that earlier in the year 2016, he had moved the High Court challenging the order of the Sultanpur Court taking cognizance and issuing him a summons to face trial, however, the same was dismissed.
Thereafter, he challenged HC's order in the Supreme Court, wherein the Top Court in October 2016, issued notices and exempted the appearance of Kejriwal to the trial court until further orders.
Against this backdrop, it was submitted that since the Special Leave to Appeal (Criminal) is still pending and if the trial is allowed to proceed and if the Special Leave to Appeal is allowed, then the entire proceedings would be a futile exercise.
Taking into account the submissions of his counsel, this Court found it appropriate to pass an interim order keeping the proceedings of the case under Sections 143, 186, 188, 341, 353, and 171-G IPC pending before the learned Special Judge (MP/MLA Court)/Additional Sessions Judge, Sultapnpur, in abeyance till the next date of listing of this petition.
Case title - Arvind Kejriwal vs. State Of U.P. Thru. Prin. Secy. Home Lko. And Another [APPLICATION U/S 482 No. - 9268 of 2022]

The Supreme Court, recently, permitted M/s. IL&FS Tamil Nadu Power Company Limited to continue with its two power plants in the State subject to full compliance of the conditions mentioned in the Environmental Clearance as well as the corrigendum to it.
A Bench comprising Justice MR Shah and Justice CT Ravikumar passed the order in pleas challenging two orders of the NGT - the first, upholding the validity of the Environmental Clearance (EC) granted to the company with direction to review and add additional conditions; the second, quashing the corrigendum adding conditions to the original EC issued to the company. While permitting the company to continue with the power plants, the Bench noted that Tamil Nadu is an energy deficit State and closing the power plants that supply power to about 40 lakhs households would not be in public interest. 
Background
M/s. IL&FS Tamil Nadu Power Company Limited, now a company under the Govt. of India, was originally incorporated in 2006 for establishing an imported coal based thermal power plant in Tamil Nadu. In 2008, the company had submitted the form to obtain terms of reference for EIA study. 
Eventually, the Expert Appraisal Committee considered the project and recommended it for Environment Clearance (EC) subject to stipulation of specific conditions like, project to keep space for providing Flue Gas De-sulfurization system with all the five units of the power plant to enable the system to be installed whenever required. Accordingly, it was granted EC. 
Challenging the grant of EC, petition was filed by fishermen and persons acting for welfare of fishermen before the National Environment Appellate Authority. Once the National Green Tribunal (NGT) was constituted the petition was transferred to it.
 The NGT upheld the validity of the EC but directed MoEF to review the EC based on cumulative impact assessment study and if required stipulate additional conditions. In the interim, it suspended the EC. Instead of a cumulative impact assessment study the company conducted a Raid cumulative impact Assessment. The EAC recommended certain additional conditions to the EC including the requirement of installing a FGD system as part of the power plant. Based on the recommendation of the EAC, the MoEF issued a corrigendum to the EC imposing additional conditions. The original petitioners again challenged the issuance of the corrigendum. By order dated 10.11.2014, the NGT quashed the corrigendum. By an interim order the Apex Court stayed the order of 10.11.2014 due to which the company commenced two power plants which are in operation since 2015.
Analysis by the Supreme Court
The Court noted that post the interim stay order, the company had commenced with two power plants and is presently supplying power to approximately 40 lakhs households. Moreover, it observed that the power plant is situated in an energy deficit State like Tamil Nadu. Thus, it opined that closing the power plant would adversely affect the power sector of the State and in turn the larger public interest. However, it noted that the company has to abide by the conditions imposed by the corrigendum. The Court noted that there was substantial compliance of the conditions imposed on the company. Though there are no fundamental breaches, the Court was of the view that some conditions are still partially complied with. The Court permitted the company to continue with the two power plants which are in operation subject to compliance of all the conditions mentioned in the EC and also the ones mentioned in the corrigendum to the EC. It also directed the company to comply with the conditions which are partly complied with within the stipulated time as was proposed by the company. 
Addressing the issue “whether against the corrigendum to the EC along with additional conditions, an appeal before the NGT would be maintainable or not”, the Bench held that an aggrieved person may always challenge the corrigendum imposing additional conditions to the Environmental Clearance, but the appeal would be restricted to the corrigendum if the original EC is not under challenge and/or the original EC has been confirmed by the NGT earlier on certain conditions which have not been challenged.

Expressing concerns over the trend of welcoming, giving election tickets to the Gangsters/Criminal by the Political parties, the Allahabad High Court yesterday observed that if this practice isn't stopped, such criminals and gangsters would become "Bhasmasur" and will give a serious dent to the country and democratic setup.
 The Bench of Justice Pradeep Kumar Srivastava made these observations as it denied bail to two UP Police officials, SO Vinay Kumar Tiwari & Beat Officer Krishna Kumar Sharma, who are facing conspiring charges in connection with the ambush in Bikru village on July 3, 2020, in which eight policemen were gunned down by Gangster Vikas Dubey.
 'Who Will Police The Police?' Allahabad High Court Denies Bail To 2 UP Cops In Bikru Encounter Conspiracy Case
Court's significant observations
 The Court opined that all the political parties should sit and take a decision that gangsters and criminals will be discouraged in politics and no political party will give tickets to them in public elections. 
 "The political parties should rise to the occasion and must guide themselves keeping in view that there cannot be a concept of 'my criminal' and 'his criminal' or 'my man' and 'his man', as a gangster is gangster only and is required to be condemned from all corners and even people/voters should also take note of it while making their choice for a candidate in a general election," observed the Court.
 Apart from this, the Court also cautioned the voters to be careful while choosing their representatives as the Court noted thus:
 "We must have the idea in mind that if we are entrusted with the responsibility of nation-building, our responsibility is to think about the future generation to whom we have to hand over a legacy. We need to ponder what kind of nation and society we want to leave for our future generation."
 Opining that crime, corruption, and population are three major problems the society is facing at present, the Court further went on to states that against crime and corruption, the State must continue with the policy of zero tolerance.
 "Strict and rigorous steps have to been taken to break and demolish the financial network of gangsters. In future, this shall certainly bring about more and more positive results towards restricting criminal activities and organized crime."
 Against this backdrop, the Court also took into account the real difficulty being faced by the police department in combating organized crime and criminal activities. 
 "The Court is of the opinion that the police personnel are mostly not provided with that kind of sophisticated arms which are available in plenty to the gangsters and their gang members. The police stations are mostly under-manned and the strength of police force is remarkably less in comparison to the population. The police have to act in accordance with legal norms and while acting so, they are required to avoid any excesses and human rights violation," the Court added.
 The Bench of Justice Pradeep Kumar Srivastava also observed that it is not an unknown phenomenon that there are policemen, maybe very few in numbers, who show their loyalty more to such gangsters than to their department for the reasons best known to them.
 "Such policemen tarnish the image, name, and fame of police and it is necessary that suspicious police personnel should be taken to task and their conduct should be regularly monitored for which a mechanism should be evolved, and if it exists already, the same should be geared up at different levels," the Court further added.
 The Court was of the view that like other departments, there has been a general fall and deterioration in the standard of functioning of the police force also and that some police leak the confidential information and strategy of police for taking action and conducting raids to arrest the gangsters. 
 The Court also opined that with time, it has been seen that the police force, not as a whole, but in small groups, has gone through a phase of moral and professional deterioration. 
 "There are black sheep also in the police force and they reflect upon the whole department which has led to growing concern, and a number of attempts have been made to mend this situation," observed the Court.
 Lastly, in such a situation, the Court added, policing such police personnel is a big task and it requires early identification of such black sheep, monitoring of their conduct, isolating them, and taking immediate strict disciplinary action against them.

While denying bail application of an ex-MLA in the UP Legislative Assembly who has been convicted by a lower court for assaulting a person in the lockup, Allahabad High Court recently observed that "nowadays, the legislatures and political persons are thinking themselves as above the law.

While denying bail application of an ex-MLA in the UP Legislative Assembly who has been convicted by a lower court for assaulting a person in the lockup, Allahabad High Court recently observed that "nowadays, the legislatures and political persons are thinking themselves as above the law. This menace cannot be lightly taken and should be dealt with iron hand."
The Bench of Justice Mohd. Aslam was hearing the plea filed by Hasratulla Shervani (ex-MLA) seeking suspension of sentence and his release on bail during the pendency of an appeal against lower court's conviction order [convicting him under various sections of IPC including 'Attempt To Murder']
Here, it may be noted that while the Court rejected the bail plea of the ex-MLA, the Court allowed the bail plea of others (in total 8 persons) who are involved in the instant case and had moved their bail plea along with the plea of the prime accused (ex-MLA).
The facts in brief
As per the prosecution, an FIR was lodged in September 2012 in Kasganj district of UP by one Shamsad (informant) alleging that in May 2011, a false report was lodged against him on account of which police has arrested the informant and lodged in the lock-up. 
Thereafter, in August 2021, while he was in the lockup, the accused-appellant Hasratulla Shervani (the then MLA) along with other persons including his relatives and supporters came to the police station and instructed the police to beat him so badly so that he will become crippled by foot and hand, otherwise they will ready for the bad consequences. 
After that, the accused-appellant Hasratulla Shervani (armed with riffle and gun) along with his supporters (armed with danda) proceeded towards the police lock-up and caught hold his hand in the lock-up from outside and assaulted upon him with an intention to kill him by the butt of the rifle and other guns, lathi and danda. 
However, since the S.O. Ram Murti Yadav intervened, he could be saved.
Submisisons made before the Court
It was contended by the counsel for accused-appellants that in this case, the informant/injured had turned hostile and other eyewitnesses have also turned hostile and only two police personnel Rtd. S.I. Phool Singh and H.Ct. Chhote Lal ha supported the prosecution. 
It is further contended that the injuries found on the body of the informant were of simple nature.
On the other hand, opposing his bail plea, the State counsel argued that Hasratulla Shervani was elected member of the Legislative Assembly and he had crossed all the limits and has beaten the informant at the lockup of the police station by calling him near and, pulling his hand outside lock-up and has also obstructed the police in performing their official duties.
Court's observations
At the outset, the Court perused the injury report and found that it prima facie supported the contents of the first information report, therefore, the Court opined, in the above circumstances and that the injured had turned hostile is of no consequence. 
The Court also noted that it appeared that on the influence of accused-appellant Hasratulla Shervani, the witnesses have turned hostile. 
Significantly, noting that the accused MLA has the duty to raise the issue of misuse of law in Assembly and get it remedied but instead of it, he himself misused the law and took law in his hand, the Court, while rejecting his bail plea, remarked thus:
"...(he) pressurized the police personnel to adopt third degree and get him lodged in police lock up, this act of the accused amounts to misuse of police machinery, therefore, his act deserves no sympathy instead of condemnation."
However, the Court allowed the bail application of other accused-appellants noting that they had followed him and the sentence awarded to them will remain suspended during the pendency of the appeal.
The Court has also listed their appeal against the lower court's judgment for a final hearing on January 10, 2022.

The Andhra Pradesh High Court recently ruled that the Executing Court cannot appoint Advocate Commissioner in execution proceedings after the trial court has already decided the question of possession of property.
Justice R. Raghunandan Rao observed,
"In the present case, the trial Court of competent jurisdiction has already decided the question of possession of the property in favour of the petitioner herein. This finding cannot be over turned by the Executing Court while passing orders in an Execution Petition. The Executing Court ought not to have directed the appointment of an advocate commissioner in such a circumstance."
 Brief Facts of the case
 The petitioner had filed a suit against respondent for grant of permanent injunction restraining them from interfering with the possession of petitioner over the suit schedule property.
 The case of the petitioner was accepted by the trial court as the petitioner proved is title and possession. After disposal of suit, the petitioner filed Execution Petition on the ground that the respondent was seeking to violate the orders of the Trial Court. The respondent moved Execution Appeal for appointment of advocate commissioner to note down the physical features of the property.
 It was the contention of the respondent that as the petitioner was never in possession of the schedule property and as the judgment and decree was obtained by petitioner by suppressing true facts, the appointment of an advocate commissioner to inspect the schedule property by noting down the physical features and taking photographs of the same would be important for the Court of Justice.
 The petitioner contended that the respondent had already filed photographs of the schedule property to prove his case and appointment of advocate commissioner is not necessary as it will protract the litigation.
 The Executing Court allowed the application to appoint an advocate commissioner for a just determination of the case. Aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner has filed the civil revision petition.
 Contentions of both sides
 Advocate Nuthalapati Krishna Murthy, counsel for the petitioner contended that appointment of advocate commissioner at the stage of execution is effectively an application for adducing fresh evidence to overturn the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court. He contended that Executing Court cannot go behind the decree or arrive at findings which are at odds with the decree. 
 Advocate C. Subodh counsel for the respondent contended that there will be no harm caused to the petitioner if the advocate commissioner is appointed to note down the physical features of the property. 
 Court's observations
 The court observed that the trial court has already decided the question of possession of the property in favour of petitioner. The finding cannot be over turned by Executing Court while passing orders in Execution Petition. Furthermore, the Executing Court has not pointed out the ambiguity which needs to be clarified before the trial court through appointment of advocate commissioner. 
 On the basis of the aforementioned observation, it was held that the Executing Court could not have directed the appointment of an advocate commissioner. The Civil Revision Petition was thus allowed. 
 Case Title: M Rama Chandraiah Versus Valleupu China Ankaiah

Just because FIRs are uploaded, chargesheets cannot be directed to be uploaded in websites.The Supreme Court on Friday held that police and investigating agencies like CBI, ED etc., cannot be directed to upload the chargesheets filed in cases in a public platform for easy access by the general public.
A bench comprising Justices MR Shah and CT Ravikumar held so while dismissing a PIL filed by RTI activist and investigative journalist Saurav Das. The bench termed as "misplaced" the reliance made by Advocate Prashant Bhushan on the Supreme Court's judgment in the Youth Bar Association Case in which directions were issued to the police to upload the FIRs in website within 24 hours except in sensitive cases like rape and sexual offences.
The Court held that the direction in the Youth Bar Association case cannot be extended to chargesheets. The FIRs were directed to be publicly uploaded so that innocent accused are not harassed and they are able to get the relief from the competent court and are not taken by surprise. This direction cannot be stretched to the public at large so far as the charge sheets are concerned.
Direction to upload chargesheets will be contrary to scheme of CrPC
The Court further held that the direction sought to put all chargesheets in the public domain is contrary to the scheme of the CrPC. 
"It may as such, violate the rights of the accused as well as the victim and/or even the investigation agency. Putting the FIR on the website cannot be equated with putting the charge sheets on public", the bench noted in the order.
Reliance on Section 74 and 76 of Evidence Act misconceived.
The petitioner had argued that a charge-sheet, not unlike an FIR, was a ‘public document’, since the filing of a charge-sheet was an act of a public official in discharge of their official duties and as such, came under the definitional ambit of ‘public document’ given in Section 74 of the Evidence Act, 1872. Therefore, a charge-sheet filed by a police department, or an investigative agency, Bhushan claimed, would be subject to the discipline of Section 76 of the Act that mandated public disclosure of any public document by a public officer having custody of such document to a person having a ‘right to inspect’.
The Court rejected these arguments as misconceived.
"Documents mentioned in S.74 of Evidence Act only can be said to be public documents, certified copies of which are to be given by the concerned public authority having the custody of such a public document. Copy of charge sheets along with necessary public documents cannot be said to be public documents u/s 74 of the Evidence Act".
The Court also held that copies of the chargesheet and the relevant documents along with the charge-sheet do not fall within Section 4(1)(b) of the RTI Act - Para 6
Bench expresses reservations about misuse
The bench had reserved orders on January 9 at admission stage itself, without issuing notice.
During the admission hearing, the bench had expressed certain reservations about the idea. The bench commented that if chargesheets are made available to public, they are likely to be misused.
"If FIRs are given to those unrelated to the case, busybodies, NGOs might misuse it", Justice Shah observed.
Justice CT Ravikumar pointed out that the Supreme Court's judgment in the Vijay Madanlal Choudhary case (which upheld the PMLA provisions) had held that ECIR was not akin to FIR and hence the accused was not entitled to a copy of the same. Therefore, the judge expressed a doubt whether a direction can be issued to the ED to publicly upload the chargesheets.
"Chargesheets cannot be given to everybody", Justice Shah added.
The counsel also relied on National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy approved by the Union Cabinet in 2012 that sought to facilitate access to public data and information in both human-readable and machine-readable forms. “There is no reason why the information contained in charge-sheets, where the investigation has been concluded, the evidence has been examined extensively, and a finding has been reached, should not be published on the website of the prosecuting agency or the state government. This is the kind of information about which every member of the public is entitled to be informed,” Bhushan contended.
Bhushan drew support from other statutory enactments such as the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Right to Information Act, 2005 as well. The main thrust of the petitioner’s argument was that not only the Evidence Act, but also the Right to Information Act and the judgments of the High Courts and Central Information Commissions vis-à-vis charge-sheets envisaged that charge-sheets were public documents and thus, available for public disclosure. Bhushan argued, “A charge-sheet filed by a police authority is definitely an act or a record of an act by a public official. Any public document should be given to a person who has the right to demand that. It is our argument that such a document would be disclosable under the Right to Information Act.” He also insisted, “It is the duty of every public authority to put out the information suo motu.”
In this connection, it was also pointed out that Section 6(2) of the Right to Information Act provided that no reason or justification was required to seek information. The counsel said, “Any person has the right to seek a copy of the charge-sheet. Under the Right to Information Act, it cannot be asked whether the person seeking the information is connected. Under this Act, the ambit of disclosable information is very wide.”
Bhushan also stated that after a chargesheet is filed, trial is to take place in an "open court", where public can have access. Therefore, he argued that the reliefs claimed by the petitioner were in line with the concept of 'open court'.

For Petitioner(s) Mr. Prashant Bhushan, AOR Mrs. Cheryl D’Souza, Adv. Ms. Ria Yadav, Adv.
Summary - Supreme Court refuses to direct that chargesheets filed by investigating agencies should be uploaded on a public website for public access- Court says that the directions in Youth Bar Association of India vs Union of India (2016) 9 SCC 473 regarding uploading of FIR cannot be extended to chargesheets- Court directed the copies of the FIRs to be published within 24 hours on the police websites or on the websites of the State Government, looking to the interest of the accused and so that innocent accused are not harassed and they are able to get the relief from the competent court and they are not taken by surprise. Therefore, the directions issued by this Court are in favour of the accused, which cannot be stretch to the public at large so far as the chargesheets are concerned- Para 4.1
Code of Criminal Procedure 1973- Sections 173, 207 - Direction to publicly upload chargesheets against the scheme of CrPC-If all the chargesheets and relevant documents produced along with the chargesheets are put on the public domain or on the websites of the State Governments it will be contrary to the Scheme of the Criminal Procedure Code and it may as such violate the rights of the accused as well as the victim and/or even the investigating agency. Putting the FIR on the website cannot be equated with putting the chargesheets along with the relevant documents on the public domain and on the websites of the State Governments - Para 4.5
Indian Evidence Act 1872- Section 74, 76-Copy of the chargesheet along with the necessary documents cannot be said to be public documents within the definition of Public Documents as per Section 74 of the Evidence Act.-As per Section 75 of the Evidence Act all other documents other than the documents mentioned in Section 74 of the Evidence Act are all private documents. Therefore, the chargesheet/documents along with the chargesheet cannot be said to be public documents under Section 74 of the Evidence Act, reliance placed upon Sections 74 & 76 of the Evidence Act is absolutely misplaced- Para 5
Right to Information Act 2005 - Copies of the chargesheet and the relevant documents along with the charge-sheet do not fall within Section 4(1)(b) of the RTI Act - Para 6

Calling it a form of “inhuman treatment”, the Delhi High Court on Tuesday held that conducting virginity test on a female detainee or accused under investigation is unconstitutional and in violation of her right to dignity enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma held that virginity test is “sexist” and violates human right to dignity of a female accused if she is subjected to such a test while being in custody. 
Observing that the test is neither modern nor scientific but is rather “archaic and irrational”, the court said that modern science and medical law disapproves the conduct of such tests on women. 
“To hold that conducting virginity test on a woman who is victim of sexual assault and on a woman who may be an accused of an offence will be on different footing or that the earlier will be unconstitutional and the later constitutional, will be a perverse finding and against the intent of the Constitution of India and Article 21,” the court added. 
Justice Sharma held that the virginity test, being violative of right to dignity of an individual, cannot be resorted to by the State and will be in teeth of the scheme of Constitution of India, including the right to life under Article 21.
“Conducting such test on the pretext of reaching truth regarding allegations against her will amount to infringement and violation of her right enshrined in Article 21,” the court said. 
The court referred to Section 53 of Cr.P.C. which provides for medical examination of a person who has been arrested for committing an offence of such a nature that there are reasonable grounds for believing that an examination will afford evidence regarding the commission of an offence.
Perusing the provision, the court said that virginity test finds no mention in its explanation as a technique to be used in medical examination of an accused to ascertain the facts which may afford evidence. 
It added that the Indian Parliament, while introducing the explanation to provision and listing several forms of medical examination, left the scope for more techniques to be included within its ambit. 
“A reading of ‘explanation’ to Section 53 shows that the same mandates medical examination of an accused person by “use of modern and scientific techniques”. It would not be out of context to state here, that, by no stretch of examination, ‘virginity test’ can presumably fall under the said provision. Virginity test is neither modern nor scientific, rather archaic and irrational. Modern science and medical law disapproves the conduct of such tests on women…,” it said. 
It also said that the “right to dignity” of a person as available under Article 21 is not suspended even when the person is accused of committing an offence or is arrested. 
“Strangely, though the word “virginity” may not have a definite scientific and medical definition, it has become a mark of purity of a woman. The intrusive testing procedure, as been held in several judgments of the Hon’ble Apex Court, does not have a medical standing. Despite being inaccurate and their being definite studies that in some women hymen may not tear during vaginal intercourse, while in others they may tear even without vaginal sexual intercourse due to sports and other activities and some women may not even have one, such test has been conducted,” it said. 
Furthermore, the court said that such a test “rests on gender bias and society’s view and obsession with the false concept of virginity being equated with purity of a woman”, adding that it also amounts to controlling women’s body, their sexual behavior and the view that “a woman with the hymen is pure and innocent.”
“It will be difficult for this Court to hold being guided by the Constitutional principles of fundamental rights that a person in custody of the authorities surrenders right to bodily integrity and submits to bodily intrusion for the prosecution to find evidence through its body. The feeling of being demeaned by such treatment in custody by bodily invasion through conducting a virginity test also brings forth the undesirable and abhorrable notion of differentiation on the basis of gender and stereotypes,” the court said. 
The court made the observations while dealing with a plea moved by Sister Sephy, convicted in 1992 Sister Abhaya murder case, challenging the virginity test conducted on her by CBI as unconstitutional. 
The court said that Sister Sephy’s contention that selective leaking of the report of virginity test by CBI and introducing false theory of hymenoplasty amounted to defamation cannot be examined by it. However, it added that she has other remedies available in law after conclusion of trial, to take recourse to.
”Needless to say, the right to dignity in custody and actions considered defamatory of the investigating agency are rights independent of each other. The protection of reputation can be in context of a defamation case,” the court said.
Expressing shock in the matter, the court said virginity test was used to determine the truth of the accusation of murder against Sister Sephy and that the test in itself is extremely traumatic for a victim of sexual assault as well as on any other women in custody. It added that such test is bound to have devastating effect on the psychological as well as physical health of the person.
Regarding the prayer for taking action against CBI, the court said that in 2008 when the test was conducted upon Sister Sephy, there were no guidelines of the Supreme Court or otherwise to have declared such tests to be unconstitutional or in violation of fundamental right of a female even qua the victims of sexual assault and that such tests were being conducted in cases of victims of sexual assault all over the country. 
“Therefore, at the relevant time, it was not barred in law or by any judgment to have got it conducted, howsoever despicable or deplorable the practice may have been,” the court said. 
However, on the question regarding grant of compensation or as to whether Sister Sephy was subjected to custodial torture, the court said that NHRC will consider afresh the representation filed by her regarding custodial torture or compensation once the criminal trial against her concludes.
“The contention of petitioner that the delay in human right proceedings before National Human Rights Commission has resulted into denial of natural justice and has caused further psychological and sociological harm to the petitioner is without merit as under Regulation 9 of the National Human Rights Commission (Procedure) Regulations, 1994, the Commission was bound by its own rules and could not have given the relief sought for due to bar of the same, however the doors are still not closed as at the end of trial, the petitioner may again approach National Human Rights Commission,” it said. 
While disposing of the matter, the court issued the following directions:
- The necessary information regarding unconstitutionality of virginity test as above be circulated to all investigating agencies/stakeholders through Secretary, Union Ministry of Home Affairs, Secretary, Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Secretary, Department of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of NCT of Delhi.
- The Delhi Judicial Academy is directed to include in its curriculum and in the workshops conducted for investigating officers, prosecutors and other stakeholders, the information regarding this issue.
- Similarly, the Delhi Police Academy for Training shall also include the necessary information regarding this issue in its training curriculum.
- The Commissioner of Police, Delhi is also directed to ensure that the investigating officers are informed and sensitized in this regard.
The court clarified that it was examining the question as to whether the virginity test conducted on Sister Sephy was in violation of her fundamental right to live with dignity and not regarding its outcome and its bearing or admissibility before the court the trial of criminal case is pending. 
“It is also clarified that the issue before this Court was only regarding the infringement of fundamental right of the petitioner and the dismissal of representation of the petitioner before National Human Rights Commission having its Headquarters at Delhi and regarding the plea for taking action against officers of Central Bureau of Investigation who were instrumental in getting the test conducted during the course of investigation having its Headquarters in Delhi, and the decision rendered by this Court will have no bearing on the criminal case pending before the concerned courts,” it said. 
The court expressed its appreciation for assistance rendered by lawyers who appeared in the case, including Advocates Romy Chacko, Ripu Daman Bhardwaj, Kirtiman Singh and S. Nanda Kumar.
A CBI Court in 2020 had found Sister Sephy guilty for the murder of Sister Abhaya and sentenced her to life imprisonment. The Court had relied on virginity test findings to support its finding that Sister Abhaya was murdered to cover-up the clandestine relationship between Sephy and another accused Father Kottoor.
The sentence now remains suspended by the Kerala High Court in appeal.
Sister Abhaya, a 20 year old novice, was found dead inside the well of St.Pious Xth Convent at Kottayam on March 27, 1992. The local police and the Crime Branch of the Kerala Police had initially closed the matter as a case of suicide. However, owing to a massive public outcry, the case was later handed over to the CBI. 
Advocates Romy Chacko, Varun Mudgal and Sudesh Kumar appeared for petitioner. 
Ripu Daman Bhardwaj, SPP for CBI; Kirtiman Singh, CGSC; Advocates S. Nanda Kumar, Deepika Nanda Kumar and Anand Murthi Rao appeared for NHRC.

The Gujarat High Court recently denied bail to an accused under the Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Act, 2015, stating that accused was prima facie a part of an 'organised crime syndicate' involved in highway thefts.'Organized Crime Syndicate', defined under Section 2(1)(f) of the Act, means a group of two or more persons who, acting either singly or collectively, as a syndicate...
The Gujarat High Court recently denied bail to an accused under the Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Act, 2015, stating that accused was prima facie a part of an 'organised crime syndicate' involved in highway thefts.
'Organized Crime Syndicate', defined under Section 2(1)(f) of the Act, means a group of two or more persons who, acting either singly or collectively, as a syndicate or gang indulging in activities of organised crime.
The Bench comprising Justice AS Supehia explained 'organized crime' as such continuing unlawful activity, indulged in by use of violence, threat, intimidation, coercion, or other unlawful means, with an objective of gaining pecuniary benefits/ undue economic or other advantage for himself or any other person or for promoting insurgency.
"Therefore, an 'organized crime' by nature of violent action indulged in by an individual singly or jointly either as a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' or on behalf of such syndicate should have been either with an object for making pecuniary gains or undue economic or other advantage or for promoting insurgency," it held.
The Court further explained that mere indulgence in a violent activity etc. either for pecuniary gain or other advantage or for promoting insurgency as an individual, either singly or jointly as a member of 'organized crime syndicate' or on behalf of a such syndicate would be sufficient for bringing the said activity within the four corners of the definition of 'organized crime'.
In the instant case, the Court noted that the accused seeking bail was the member of a gang involved in committing organized crimes like vehicle theft, stealing valuable muddamal on moving vehicles, violation of the Arms Act, violation of the Prohibition Act, causing injury, loot, robbery, extortion, gang rape, abduction, murder, attempt to murder, preventing public servant from discharging his duty, deadly attack on public servant and causing damage to public property.
Further, applicant used to keep all muddamal articles, which were still in possession and used to help the accused to dispose of so that they could not be caught.
In this backdrop, it was held,
"there are at least 20 members involved in various offences. The complicity of the applicant can only be known after other members of the syndicate are apprehended and investigated by the policy authorities. Prima facie, the investigation reveals that the applicant is a member of the syndicate as she used to deal with the stolen articles, which were looted by the other accused from various highways of the State. The material on record reveals that prima facie the applicant along with other coaccused, who are relatives and family members, have formed an organised crime syndicate for committing the offences, and her role as alleged will satisfy the requirement of section 2(1)(a) which defines "abet"." 
Background
 Five FIRs were registered against the Applicant. It was alleged that she was a member of an "organised crime syndicate" that used to chase and recce vehicles passing on the Ahmedabad-Rajkot and Ahmedabad National Highways, including certain internal roads during night.
 The Applicant contended that there five FIRs which were registered against the Applicant which were clubbed together for which separate trial will take place. Hence, she should not suffer under the rigour of the trial under the Act. 
Senior Advocate Yatin Oza contended thatPer Article 20(2), she cannot be prosecuted more than once for the same offence. Except one offence registered under Section 207 of IPC in 2016, all other offences pertain to Section 379 and 413 of IPC which was not a serious offence. Further, it could not be said that she was engaged in unlawful activity of an organised crime, or she was part of an organised syndicate under 2(f) of the Act. Except an offence punishable under Section 413 of IPC, the Applicant was not named in the FIR, but she was named in supplementary chargesheets. 
Additionally, all offences were registered on the statement of the co-accused which cannot be considered a substantial piece of evidence. Significantly, under Section 2(c) of the Act, filing more than one chargesheet for an offence punishable with more than 3 years imprisonment is not enough, but it must be satisfied that the unlawful activity is grave. She had been granted temporary bail by the High Court wherein she did not violate any condition. She also had a husband and a minor son who have been falsely encountered by the police. Lastly, dealing with stolen articles was a minor offence and did not attract the provisions of the Act.
 Per contra, the Respondent contended that there were 20 other accused persons for the offences. The Applicant was part of an organised crime syndicate. She had also assaulted police authorities with a co-accused. There were 9 vehicles which were seized out of which one belonged to her. She was directly connected with the organised crime syndicate. She was involved in 93 offences while her brother was involved in 68. 
 Judgement
 Justice Supehia, rejected the Article 20(2) contention stating that so long the provision remain in the statute (2015 Act), the Court cannot express or critcise its consequences being critical or in conflict with the provisions of Article 20(2) of the Constitution, more particularly while exercising powers under the provision of section 439 of the Cr.P.C.
Prima facie, the Bench concluded, it seemed that the Applicant was part of a syndicate of 20 accused persons who were her relatives and family members. It referred to Prasad Shrikant Purohit vs State Of Maharashtra & Anr [(2015) 7 SCC 440] wherein the Supreme Court had explained the pari materia provisions of Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act, 1999 ['MCOCA']. The Apex Court had explained thus:
 Justice Supehia opined that before the promulgation of the Act in 2019, the Applicant had been arraigned as an accused for provisions of Section 379 and 309 of IPC and after the promulgation in 3 offences under the same sections. The investigation is ongoing. Hence, the registration of offences on the same day cannot dilute the offence registered under the Act and this cannot be an ipso facto influence on the grant of bail. 
Further agreeing with the definition of the Supreme Court of "organised crime", the Bench concluded that prima facie, the contents of the FIRs and chargesheet disclose that the Applicant was working in an organised crime syndicate.
 In finality, the Bench explained that under Section 20(4) of the Act, there must be reasonable norms for believing that the accused was not guilty. However, looking at the role of the Applicant, the Bench could not be impressed from a prima facie perspective that the Applicant was not guilty. Accordingly, the Application was rejected.
 Case Title: BILKISBANU (BILKISBANO) HANIFKHAN @ KALO MUNNO AMIRKHAN JATMALEK Versus STATE OF GUJARAT
Case No.: R/CR.MA/12478/2021

The Allahabad High Court recently set aside a show cause notice sent after pre-mediation as the Court noted that the respondent (a government authority) had already made up their mind and had expressed their decision in the notice while issuing the same to the petitioner (M/S Bcits Pvt.

The Allahabad High Court recently set aside a show cause notice sent after pre-mediation as the Court noted that the respondent (a government authority) had already made up their mind and had expressed their decision in the notice while issuing the same to the petitioner (M/S Bcits Pvt. Ltd.).
"...even if the petitioner offers its explanation, it would be an empty formality and a futile exercise. Fairness demanded that the respondent should have taken care to keep their mind open to the issues while seeking an explanation," remarked the bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Gupta and Justice Dinesh Pathak.
Essentially, the petitioner-Company was given a contract of "Door to Door Meter Reading, Bill Generation and Serving through SBM/Mobile App/Other Suitable Means with Downloading" by the respondent-Corporation in 2018.
In June 2020 and in August 2021, the petitioner was issued a notice threatening to blacklist it on account of alleged irregularities on its part. However, both the notices were later on, dropped.
However, another notice was issued in August 2021 with the same allegations threatening the petitioner company to blacklist it. The Petitioner comapny gave a reply to this notice, however, the explanation was not accepted and the respondent arrived at a definite finding that the alleged irregularities and breaches committed by the Company had resulted in tarnishing the image of the respondent-Corporation.
Accordingly, the petitioner company was issued with a show cause notice to come forward and explain as why it should not be blacklisted/debarred for a period of two years.
Challenging this notice, the petitioner company moved to the High Court stating that since the notice was issued after pre-meditation and thus, issuing notice and seeking explanation would not serve any purpose as the respondent/corporation that issued the notice had already made up its mind.
Agreeing with this contention of the petitioner-company, the Court noted that the respondent corporation had already expressed its mind that the explanation offered by the petitioner company was unsatisfactory and that the petitioner company was guilty of the charges levelled against it. 
In the above backdrop, the Court noted that now, even if the petitioner offers its explanation, it would be an empty formality and a futile exercise. Further, noting that the respondent-Corporation had already made up its mind that the explanation was not worthy of acceptance, therefore, the notice can't be said to be a show cause notice as the decision had already been taken. 
Accordingly, the Court quashed the impugned notice leaving it open to the respondent corporation to issue a fresh notice in accordance with the law, if so advised.
Senior Advocate Prashant Chandra assisted by Advocate Kartikey Dubey appeared for the petitioner company.
Case title - M/S Bcits Pvt. Ltd. v. Purvanchal Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. And Another [WRIT - C No. - 15363 of 2022]

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has quashed a demand by the GST Department against Genpact India and held that subcontracting for a service is not an "intermediary" service.
The division bench of Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa and Justice Deepak Manchanda has noted that Genpact India provides the main service directly to the overseas clients of Genpact International (GI) but does not get any remuneration from such clients. It is GI that gets paid by its customers, to whom the services are being provided directly by the petitioner. Nothing has been brought to light to show that the petitioner has a direct contract with the customers of GI.
The petitioner/assessee, Genpact India, is registered with the Haryana GST Authorities and is involved in providing a host of services collectively referred to as BPO services to customers located in India as well as outside India.
The petitioner entered into a Master Services Sub-Contracting Agreement (MSA) with GI, an entity located outside India. As per the terms of the MSA, various services are to be provided by the petitioner on a principal-to-principal basis. The petitioner is engaged by GI for the actual performance of BPO services for the clients of GI located outside India. The arrangement requires the petitioner to complete and submit the assigned processes and scope of work directly to third parties located outside India.
The petitioner filed an application with the Haryana GST authorities, claiming a refund of unutilized ITC on account of zero-rated supplies of services without payment of IGST under the Letter of Undertaking.
The Additional Commissioner CGST (Appeals) has held that the services provided by the petitioner are in the nature of "intermediary services" and do not qualify as "export of services." The Additional Commissioner CGST (Appeals) rejected the refund claim of unutilized Input Tax Credit (ITC) used in making zero-rated supplies of services without payment of Integrated Goods and Service Tax.
The petitioner contended that as per the definition of "intermediary" under Section 2 (13) of the IGST Act, a person who provides services "on his own account" is not an "intermediary." The provider of the main service is clearly excluded from the definition of "intermediary." No evidence is on record to establish that the petitioner had not provided the main service. There was no mention of a third party that the petitioner had "arranged" and who had then provided the main services. The petitioner is rendering services "on its own account" and is not facilitating any supply of services between GI and its customers. The petitioner is responsible for providing all services as well as all risks associated with their performance and pricing.
The department contended that the petitioner is acting on behalf of GI and supplying support services so that GI can supply main services in the nature of business process outsourcing, information technology services, managing relationships with customers, negotiating customer agreements and statements of work, and customer invoicing and collection to its customers.
The court, while allowing the petition, held that the petitioner is providing the services that have been subcontracted to it by GI. It receives fees and charges from the main contractor, GI, for its services as a subcontractor. The main contractor, i.e., GI, in turn, is receiving commissions from its clients for the main services that are rendered by the petitioner pursuant to the arrangement of subcontracting.

Emphasizing that India worships little girls, but at the same time, the cases of pedophilia are increasing in the Country, the Allahabad High Court today denied bail to a man who has been booked for raping a 13-year-old girl.
Importantly, the Bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar Singh observed thus:
"In such a situation, if the right decision is not taken from the Court at the right time, then the trust of a victim/common man will not be left in the judicial system. This is the time to strictly stop this kind of crime."
The case before the Court
The Court was hearing the plea of a man who allegedly raped a 13-year-old girl when she was alone in the house for doing some household work and all her family members had gone to the agricultural field for cutting fodder.
Allegedly, the applicant taking the advantage of the situation, forcibly entered the house of the informant, and threatening to kill the victim, dragged her inside the room by grabbing her hair, and forcibly committed rape upon the victim.
During the course of this unfortunate incident, suddenly the informant, her son Rohit and one Magan came to the house and knocked on the door, but when they entered the house, they saw the victim lying unconscious in a naked condition and the applicant tried to flee by climbing the wall.
However, he was caught and when the victim gained consciousness, she narrated the whole incident. Thereafter, the police was informed about the incident on phone by the family members of the informant, on which the applicant was arrested by the police from the house of the informant.
The counsel for the Applicant argued that there was a love affair between the victim and the applicant and that she had herself called the applicant, but he was caught hold by the family members of the victim. 
Court's observations
At the outset, the Court noted that the victim, aged about 13 years, is studying in the fifth standard, and in the opinion of the doctor, who conducted her medical examination, signs of violence seen and sexual violence cannot be ruled out. 
Thus, noting that the in this case, a small innocent girl had been raped, who does not understand its meaning, the Court remarked thus:
"Rape is a heinous crime. The victim suffers from psychological effects of embarrassment, disgust, depression, guilt, and even suicidal tendencies. Many cases go unreported. In almost rape cases, the victim was unwilling to report the name of the abuser. The 4 families of the victim remain silent about the sexual offences in order to protect the family image. The victim/female small child experience sexual abuse once tend to be more vulnerable to abuse in adult life. Healing is slow and systematic."
Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions advanced on behalf of parties, the gravity of the offence, and the severity of the punishment, the Court did not find any good ground to grant bail to the applicant. Accordingly, the bail application was rejected
Case title - Jasman Singh @ Pappu Yadav v. State of U.P. and Another
Read Order

Closing the contempt proceedings against a person, the Delhi High Court observed that the anxiety, which the man went through during the trial of the case filed by his former wife, does not justify the actions of casting aspersion on a judicial officer.
Justice Manmeet Pritam Singh Arora accepted the unconditional apology tendered by him, with a warning to exercise restraint and refrain from casting any aspersion on the court in future.
The court disposed of the contempt plea dated September 29, 2016, forwarded on a reference made by Additional Sessions Judge Pulastya Pramachala of Karkardooma Courts. The judge had observed that the accused, during the course of trial in a 2011 case, habitually casted aspersions on the integrity of the court after he was denied the relief in successive applications seeking similar relief. 
Justice Arora directed that if he casts aspersion on integrity of the court in any legal proceedings where he is a party in future, the record of the contempt petition shall be read in evidence and the subsequent conduct will be considered as an “aggravated contempt of the Court” under section 2(c) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. 
Senior Advocate Akshay Makhija, an amicus curiae in the matter, submitted that the person was acquitted in the trial during the pendency of contempt proceedings. 
He also requested the court to consider that the contemnor is a layman without any formal education of law and that he unfortunately used intemperate language in the application owing to the fact that he was defending his case in person.
Noting that the contemnor had persisted in casting aspersions on the judge despite the fact that the transfer applications filed by him were dismissed as being without any merit, the court said:
“This Court is of the opinion that the anxiety which the Respondent went through during the trial does not justify his actions of casting aspersion on the presiding Judge. The fact that the Respondent elected to defend his own case is no justification for being disrespectful towards the presiding Judge and therefore, the opinion of the ASJ that accused with a mala fide intent had started to quote him in such a manner, so as to show that he is deliberately trying to supress the evidences of the criminal case and that the accused has been casting aspersions on the integrity of the Court in order to justify his act of moving one application after another, cannot be faulted with.”
The court observed that if the contemnor's explanation for his “intemperate pleadings” is accepted, it would entitle every litigant to undermine the majesty of the court “on the specious plea of anxiety.”
While imposing a cost of Rs. 5,000 on him, the court said that the same be deposited with Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee within two weeks.
“It is directed that the Respondent herein will be under an obligation to disclose this order to the Court in which any subsequent contempt proceedings is filed against him. With the aforesaid directions the present contempt petition is disposed of,” it said. 
Title: COURT ON ITS OWN MOTION v. REHMAN AFTAB ALAM

Granting bail to an accused in a case involving recovery of 500 grams of heroin – which qualifies as 'commercial quantity' under the NDPS Act, the Punjab and Haryana High Court said his argument that he has been falsely implicated in the case gets substantiated from the fact that on 18 dates, no prosecution witness came forward for deposition before the trial court.
Holding that conditions under Section 37 NDPS Act are satisfied in the case, the court said it is of the prima facie view that there are reasons to believe at least at this stage that the petitioner is not guilty of the offence. 
"Apart from the same, so far as the second ingredient for making a departure from the bar contained under Section 37 of the NDPS Act is concerned, the petitioner is stated to be not involved in any other case under the NDPS Act nor it has been argued by the learned State counsel that in case the petitioner is released on bail, then he may repeat the offence or may abscond from justice," Justice Jasgurpreet Singh Puri said.
The accused had filed a second bail application before the court in the case registered against him and a co-accused under Sections 21, 61 and 85 of the NDPS Act at Police Station Maqsudan, District Jalandhar Rural for the alleged possession of 500 grams of heroin.
Senior Advocate Dr. Anmol Rattan Sidhu, representing the accused, submitted that he has been in custody for more than two years. It was also argued that the accused is not a habitual offender and is not involved in any other case under the NDPS Act. However, the court was told a case under Section 279 IPC was registered against him in 2014.
Contending that the entire prosecution story is false and that the accused was falsely implicated in the case when he was going to Jammu & Kashmir with his friends, Sidhu submitted that even though charges were framed more than a year ago, till date only one prosecution witness has been examined - a mere formal witness who had collected the sample and sent it to the Forensic Science Laboratory.
 "There was a team of 5-6 police personnel including Sub-Inspector, Assistant Sub-Inspector, Head Constable and other officials, who as per the FIR constituted the police party but none of them have stepped into the witness box and deposed despite the fact that more than one year has lapsed after the framing of the charges," Sidhu submitted.
The bench was told that despite adjournments and orders summoning the witnesses, they have not appeared and deposed before the trial court resulting in delay of the proceedings. 
"There is no justification coming forward as to why the police party who allegedly apprehended the petitioner as per the prosecution story, has chosen not to step into the witness box for more than 1 year and 2 months despite 18 adjournments and repeated summons sent to them which goes to show that on the face of it the petitioner has been falsely implicated in the present case," he said.
Sidhu relied on Supreme Court's recent decision in Satender Kumar Antil v. Central Bureau of Investigation and Another, 2022 AIR (SC) 3386 to contend that the right of speedy trial is fundamentally guaranteed to him under Article 21 of the Constitution. He argued it is a false case where the bar contained under Section 37 should not apply.
The State conceded to the factual submissions made by the petitioner's counsel.
 Justice Puri in the order recorded that the police has failed to answer its query as to why more than one year after the framing of the charges, the police party - who had rather put the criminal law into motion, failed to appear before the Court and depose for 18 dates.
"A perusal of the zimni orders would show that for a number of times Judge, Special Court directed that the prosecution witnesses who are the official witnesses in the present case be summoned through the SSP. Despite the fact that such orders were passed, till date, nobody has come forward for deposition. No justification has come forward from the State counsel as to what prevented them for deposing in Court and with the result that 18 adjournments were granted by the learned Special Court." 
The court further said argument raised by the senior counsel, that the delay has been caused by the prosecution and not by the petitioner which has resulted in his incarceration for more than two years without his fault and on this ground he deserves the concession of regular bail, carries weight.
"So far as the arguments raised by the learned senior counsel that he has been falsely implicated in the present case, this Court is of the view that the same get substantiated from the fact that for 18 times no prosecution witness came forward for deposition," it added, while granting bail to the accused, especially considering that he has been in custody for more than two years.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that the amendments made in Section 372 CrPC by adding a proviso in the year 2009, creating a substantive right of appeal for the 'victim' is not retrospective in nature.Meaning thereby, a 'victim' [as defined under Section 2w (wa) of CrPC] has no right to prefer an appeal against an order passed before December 31, 2009, acquitting...
The Allahabad High Court has observed that the amendments made in Section 372 CrPC by adding a proviso in the year 2009, creating a substantive right of appeal for the 'victim' is not retrospective in nature.
Meaning thereby, a 'victim' [as defined under Section 2w (wa) of CrPC] has no right to prefer an appeal against an order passed before December 31, 2009, acquitting the accused/punishing him for a lesser offence/imposing inadequate compensation.
It may be noted that December 31, 2009, is the decisive date for determining whether a 'victim' has a right to prefer an appeal under Section 372 CrPC as the proviso, providing the right to appeal was added to Section 372 CrPC came into effect on December 31, 2009.
This proviso provides a right 'victim' [as defined under Section 2w (wa) of the Cr.P.C.] to move an appeal on three grounds namely
(i) When the accused person(s) have been acquitted;
(ii) When the accused person(s) have been convicted for a lesser offence;
(iii) Where inadequate compensation has been imposed by the Court (s).
The case before the Court
The bench of Justice Vivek Kumar Birl and Justice Vikas Budhwar was hearing an appeal filed by the 'victim' u/s 372 of the CrPC seeking to challenge the judgement and order of the year 2004 passed by the Sessions Judge, Mirzapur whereby the accused-respondents were acquitted of the offences under Section 302/34 IPC.
At the outset, the Court noted that apart from the fact that the Stamp Reporter had reported a delay of 6228 days in filing the appeal, the appeal itself was not maintainable as when the acquittal order was passed by the Court below, there was no proviso to Section 372 CrPC giving a right to the victim to file an appeal against such acquittal order.
"...it is very much clear that the amendments so made in Section 372 CrPC by adding a proviso in the year 2009 creating a substantive right of appeal is not retrospective in nature. It is, therefore, clear that in the year 2004 when the impugned judgement under challenge was passed, the appellant herein who claims to be the victim had no right to challenge the impugned order dated 2.12.2004 by way of filing the appeal," the Court remarked.
Therefore, it was held that the appeal, which was filed after a delay of about more than 21 years challenging a 2004 Judgment which was passed much prior to the amendment (adding the proviso in the year 2009 with effect from 31.12.2009) was not maintainable. 
The appeal was accordingly dismissed as not maintainable.
Case title - Triyugi Nath Tiwari v. State Of U.P. And 2 Others [CRIMINAL APPEAL DEFECTIVE U/S 372 CR.P.C. No.- 10 of 2022]
Case citation:  (AB) 371

The Supreme Court has held that the authorities of the Directorate of Enforcement(ED) who are investigating into money laundering cases as per the Prevention of Money Laundering Act are not "police officers". Hence, the statements recorded by ED authorities under Section 50 of the PMLA Act while inquiring into the proceeds of crime are not hit by Article 20(3) of the Constitution (the right against self incrimination).
The Court however held that the defence of an accused who is prosecuted for money laundering offence that his statement is inadmissible in evidence as barred by Section 25 of the Evidence Act (which makes confessional statements to police inadmissible in evidence) can be considered on a case-to-case basis.
The protection under Article 20(3) and Section 25 of the Evidence Act cannot be invoked at the stage of summons and may be raised only after a formal arrest.
"At the stage of issue of summons, the person cannot claim protection under Article 20(3) of the Constitution. However, if his/her statement is recorded after a formal arrest by the ED official, the consequences of Article 20(3) or Section 25 of the Evidence Act may come into play to urge that the same being in the nature of confession, shall not be proved against him", the Court said.
"In a given case, whether the protection given to the accused who is being prosecuted for the offence of money- laundering, of Section 25 of the Evidence Act is available or not, may have to be considered on case-to-case basis being rule of evidence", the Court stated.
A bench comprising Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar made the above pronouncement in the judgment in the case Vijay Madanlal Choudhary vs Union of India, in which several provisions of PMLA were challenged.
The petitioners had challenged Section 50 of the PMLA on the ground of being violative of Articles 20(3) and 21 of the Constitution.
Protection of Article 20(3) not available at the stage of ED summons; may be raised after formal arrest
The Court noted Section 50 gives the powers of a Civil Court to the ED authorities to summon any person and call for production of documents in an investigation under the Act. The Court said that such a summons or direction can be issued against any witness and such a witness need not be an accused. The protection under Article 20(3) is available only to an accused person.
"...designated officials have been empowered to summon any person for collection of information and evidence to be presented before the Adjudicating Authority. It is not necessarily for initiating a prosecution against the noticee as such. The power entrusted to the designated officials under this Act, though couched as investigation in real sense, is to undertake inquiry to ascertain relevant facts to facilitate initiation of or pursuing with an action regarding proceeds of crime, if the situation so warrants and for being presented before the Adjudicating Authority", the Court said.
"In such a situation, at the stage of issue of summons, the person cannot claim protection under Article 20(3) of the Constitution. However, if his/her statement is recorded after a formal arrest by the ED official, the consequences of Article 20(3) or Section 25 of the Evidence Act may come into play to urge that the same being in the nature of confession, shall not be proved against him", the Court added.
Not police officers.
"The purposes and objects of the 2002 Act for which it has been enacted, is not limited to punishment for offence of money- laundering, but also to provide measures for prevention of money- laundering. It is also to provide for attachment of proceeds of crime, which are likely to be concealed, transferred or dealt with in any manner which may result in frustrating any proceeding relating to confiscation of such proceeds under the 2002 Act. This Act is also to compel the banking companies, financial institutions and intermediaries to maintain records of the transactions, to furnish information of such transactions within the prescribed time in terms of Chapter IV of the 2002 Act. Considering the above, it is unfathomable as to how the authorities referred to in Section 48 can be described as police officer."
Tofan Singh judgment distinguished
The petitioners relied on the judgment in the Tofan Singh case, which held that NCB officers authorised to investigate NDPS Act are "police officers" within the meaning of Section 25 of the Evidence Act and hence the confessional statements recorded by them under Section 67 of the NDPS Act are inadmissible in evidence.
The Court distinguished Tofan Singh judgment saying that it was rendered in the particular legislative framework of the NDPS Act, which allowed investigation into NDPS offences both by the local police and NCB officers. This led to a dichotomy between the investigation carried out by police and NCB and it was in this context that the Tofan Singh judgment was rendered.
However, under the PMLA Act, the local police are barred from investigating money laundering offences and exclusive jurisdiction has been conferred upon the ED authorities.
"However, in the case of provisions of the 2002 Act, there is no similar provision as Section 53A of the NDPS Act. As a result, even this deficiency noticed in that judgment has no application to the provisions of the 2002 Act. The Court also noted in that decision that unlike the provisions of in the Customs Acts, 1962, Central Excise Act, 1944 and Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966, in the case of NDPS Act prevention, detection and punishment of crime cannot be said to be ancillary to the purpose of regulating and exercising of control over narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances", the bench observed.
The bench also referred to precedents holding that authorities carrying out investigation under the Customs Act, Central Excise Act, Railway Property Act etc., are not police officers.
"Ex-consequenti, the statements recorded by authorities under the 2002 Act, of persons involved in the commission of the offence of money-laundering or the witnesses for the purposes of inquiry/investigation, cannot be hit by the vice of Article 20(3) of the Constitution or for that matter, Article 21 being procedure established by law. In a given case, whether the protection given to the accused who is being prosecuted for the offence of money- laundering, of Section 25 of the Evidence Act is available or not, may have to be considered on case-to-case basis being rule of evidence".
The Court concluded its findings on this point as follows :
(a) The process envisaged by Section 50 of the 2002 Act is in the nature of an inquiry against the proceeds of crime and is not "investigation" in strict sense of the term for initiating prosecution and the Authorities under the 2002 Act (referred to in Section 48), are not police officers as such.
(b) The statements recorded by the Authorities under the 2002 Act are not hit by Article 20(3) or Article 21 of the Constitution of India.

The Gujarat High Court has recently quashed and set aside the order of termination of an employee, who was convicted for corruption, on the ground that he was neither given a show cause notice before such termination nor an opportunity to explain his case.
The Bench comprising Justice Biren Vaishnav directed the employer to reinstate the employee to his original post along with consequential benefits and backwages. However, liberty is granted to pass appropriate order afresh in accordance with law after giving opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and considering the reply which may be filed. 
The Court was hearing a challenge to the order passed by Respondent No. 3 terminating the services of the Petitioner for conviction under Sections 7,12, 13(1)(d) and 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988.
 The Petitioner vehemently contested that vide a criminal appeal, the execution of the sentence passed against him was suspended and therefore, the termination order should not have been passed. Further, no show cause notice was issued to the Petitioner prior to the termination order. Reliance was placed on V.D.Vaghela vs. G.C.Raiger, Deputy IGP, 1993 (2) GLH 1005, where it was held:
 "it is borne out that termination of service without issuance of a notice prior to the order and without considering the reply of the petitioner was bad."
 Similarly, in Ahmadkhan Inayatkhan v. District Superintendent of Police, Banaskantha [1989 (2) GLR 1301], the Gujarat High Court had held that failure to give notice vitiated the dismissal.
 Per contra, the Respondents relied on H.N. Rao v. State of Gujarat [2000(3) GLH 358] wherein it was held that notice was not necessary before passing the order of dismissal. Further, in Union of India v. V.K. Bhaskar [(1997) 11 SCC 383], the High Court held that dismissal from service on the ground of conduct which led to conviction on a criminal charge could be passed, for which pendency of an appeal against conviction was no bar.
 The Bench, however, pointed out that the law has travelled far and in Kiritkumar D. Vyas v. State of Gujarat [1982 (2) GLR 79], the Gujarat High Court had opined, "conviction, therefore cannot be utilised for passing an order of dismissal blindfoldedly without hearing the delinquent on the question of sentence."
 While affirming the decision in AhmadKhan, the Bench emphasised that the principles of natural justice must be followed. Justice Vaishnav averred:
 "It is thus considered an essential requirement that before disciplinary authority passed the order of dismissal against the respondent who was convicted of criminal charge to give show- cause notice and to consider the reply given to the show-cause notice."
 Keeping in view the precedents, the Bench directed the reinstatement of the Petitioner along with benefits within 15 days of passing the order while clarifying that the Respondent was not precluded from passing appropriate order with fresh inquiry.
 Case Title:Ramsingbhai Saburbhai Patel vs State Of Gujarat
 Case No.: C/SCA/22629/2019

The Delhi High Court has directed Delhi Building and other Construction Workers Welfare Board to consider accepting applications of constructions workers six months before they become eligible for receiving the pension. 
Justice Rekha Palli observed that since the Building and Other Construction Workers, Act 1996 and Rules are silent regarding the time period during which pension must be sanctioned to the workers after they attain the age of 60 years, it would save a lot of inconvenience to them if they are permitted to submit their applications six months prior to their becoming eligible for receiving pension.
“The respondent Board is, therefore, directed to consider accepting applications of the constructions workers six months before they become eligible for receiving pension so that once they reach the age of superannuation, their pension can be sanctioned, at the earliest, without any further delay,” the court said.
The court was hearing a plea of a construction worker who was duly registered with the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board, seeking release of her pension with interest at the rate of 18% per annum.
The counsel appearing for the Board, on instructions, submitted that an order was passed on January 6 sanctioning pension in favour of the petitioner w.e.f. February 1, the date when she became eligible for receiving pension. 
The petitioner’s counsel submitted that the Board, having delayed the sanctioning of pension despite her eligibility to receive the same, ought to pay interest to her at 18% per annum on the delayed amount. 
However, the contention was objected by the Board’s counsel who submitted that the respondent Board cannot be faulted for the delay. 
After hearing both the parties, Justice Palli said that the Board was justified in urging that pension could not be sanctioned in the petitioner’s favour without her submitting the requisite documents and, therefore, it cannot be said that there was any inordinate delay on its part in sanctioning the pension. 
“Even though, both, the Act and the Rules are silent regarding the time period within which the pension must be sanctioned, in my view, the respondent, which is enjoined with a statutory duty to disburse pension in favour of these construction workers, who play a crucial role in the building of the society, ought to take expeditious steps to ensure that pension is released to them at the earliest,” the court said. 
However, the bench observed that it would be in the interest of justice that the petitioner be paid interest on the delayed pension amount “after discounting 45 days” from the date she submitted her documents on August 5, last year. 
“The writ petition is, accordingly, disposed of by directing the respondent to pay interest @ 6% per annum on the delayed amount of pension with effect from 21.09.2022 (after excluding 45 days w.e.f. 05.08.2022),” the court ordered. 
Title: RAJO v. DELHI BUILDING AND OTHER CONSTRUCTION WORKERS BOARD & ANR.

The Himachal Pradesh High Court recently held that the stringent provisions concerning bail under Section 37 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985 cannot be invoked in perpetuity to dilute the right of the accused to an expeditious trial
The pronouncement was made by Justice Satyen Vaidya while hearing a plea for bail in a matter where the petitioner-accused had been in custody since March 30, 2021, for offences under Sections 20 and 29 of ND&PS Act. 
In his plea the petitioner-accused submitted that he had been in custody for about a year and ten months while the trial was still moving at a snail's pace which in turn had infringed his Constitutional right to an expeditious trial. 
Contesting the plea the respondents countered by submitting that the rigor of Section 37 of the NDPS Act would continue to apply throughout the trial and merely, on the ground of delay in conclusion of trial, petitioner cannot be released on bail. 
The moot question that fell for adjudication before the bench was as to whether the provisions of Section 37 of the Act could be construed to have same efficacy, throughout the pendency of trial, notwithstanding, the period of custody of the accused, especially, when it is weighed against his fundamental right to have expeditious disposal of trial. 
Justice Vaidya observed that the Constitutional guarantee of expeditious trial cannot be diluted by applying the rigors of Section 37 of ND&PS Act in perpetuity.
The bench noted that no prosecution witnesses had been examined till date, despite the petitioner remaining in custody since March 2021 which therefore go on to suggest that the trial is not likely to be concluded in near future. There is nothing on record to suggest that the delay in trial is attributable to the petitioner, the court added. 
In order to fortify the stand, Justice Vaidya observed that in a number of cases, both the Supreme Court as well as coordinate benches of the High Court have been allowing bail to those accused under the NDPS Act on account of such persons having been kept incarcerated for prolonged periods prior to the trial.
The High Court, therefore allowed the bail plea in this case on the petitioner furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial court.
Case Title: Deep Raj @Neetu Vs State of Himachal Pradesh 

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently observed that when a Magistrate directs a preliminary enquiry under Section 156(3) CrPC and the police without reporting back to the Magistrate straightway goes on to file an FIR without any direction thereto, the same amounts to usurpation of the powers of the Magistrate.
The observations were made by Justice Sanjay Dhar while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had challenged the FIR registered with the Police Station, Udhampur. 
The petitioner premised his plea inter alia on the ground that the since the Magistrate had ordered a preliminary enquiry under Section 156(3) the police instead of submitting a report to the Magistrate, on its own registered the impugned FIR, thereby circumventing the process of law initiated by the Magistrate.
Justice Dhar noted that the complainant/respondent had initially approached the Police Station and thereafter, the SSP concerned but when the complainant failed to get the desired result of registration of FIR, he filed an application under Section 156(3) CrPC before the Judicial Magistrate. 
Court further noted that the Magistrate accordingly directed the SHO, Udhampur to verify the allegations and submit his report by the next date of hearing. On May 17 2021, an application was made by the SHO before the Magistrate seeking extension of 15 days time in submitting his report and amidst these ongoing proceedings the impugned FIR came to be registered. 
The moot question that warranted answers from the bench was as to whether the action of the Police to register the impugned FIR when there was no direction from the Magistrate to register the case is in accordance with law, particularly when the Magistrate had specifically directed the SHO concerned to submit his report after verifying the allegations made in the application.
Deliberating on the matter Justice Dhar observed that is true that the incharge of a Police Station is vested with the power to register an FIR once information with regard to cognizable offence is given to him. It is also not in dispute that a Magistrate while passing a direction under Section 156(3) CrPC. is only reminding the officer incharge of a Police Station about his statutory duty to register an FIR in respect of a cognizable offence.
However, once the Magistrate had sought a preliminary report, the Police could not have straight away registered the FIR as the same would not allow the Magistrate to apply her mind to the material prior to passing an appropriate direction.
"In the present case, before the learned Magistrate could apply her mind to the application of the complainant and the report the Police, the proceedings pending before her were rendered redundant by the action of the Police. This amounts to an illegality which is writ large on the face of the record", said the court.
While quashing the FIR the court directed the Investigating Agency to place its report before the Judicial Magistrate, Udhampur, who after considering the report of the Police would be at liberty to pass orders in accordance with law.

The Bombay High Court has recently observed that a disclosure statement made by a co-accused under Section 27 of the Evidence Act is not legal evidence qua a non-maker accused.
The bench of Justice Nijamoddin Jahiroddin Jamadar observed thus while granting bail to one Raju Jokhanprasad Gupta in a case registered against him under Section 307 of IPC [Attempt to murder].
The case (as alleged) in brief
The first informant/victim Kiran Ratilal Kataria is working as a Vice-President (HR) with Rieter Company and the Applicant Raju Gupta is the proprietor of 'Ravi Steel' who used to lift the scrap generated at First Informant's Company.
In November 2021, the company terminated the scrap material contract with the applicant, since then, the applicant was trying to win back the contract, however, since the same was not restored, therefore, the applicant and the co-accused hatched a conspiracy to mount an attack on the officers of the company.
Pursuant to this, on 27th December 2021, the first informant's car was stopped by Accused no.4 and he attempted a blow by means of the scythe on the neck of the first informant. He also exhorted the first informant that his life would not be spared, however, since the other employees of the company reached the scene of the occurrence, the assailants fled away.
The criminal case was registered and the applicant and co-accused came to be arrested. Thereafter, the accused moved to the High Court seeking bail and argued that the Co-accused has been released on bail, and since the investigation is complete and the applicant has been in custody since 28th December 2021, further detention of the applicant as an under-trial prisoner is not warranted.
It was argued by the counsel for the applicant that the material available against the applicant primarily consists of the statement of the first informant and the disclosure statement allegedly made by the co-accused implicating the applicant.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court noted that there was material to show that the first informant and his driver had suffered injuries in the alleged occurrence, however, the Court opined that the injuries appeared to be simple.
Regarding the disclosure statement, the Court said that the arguments of the applicant were justified and that the disclosure statement made by the co-accused under Section 27 of the Evidence Act is not legal evidence qua a non-maker accused.
"Undoubtedly, the material on record prima facie suggests that the applicant was desperate to have the contract to lift the scrap material restored. This may furnish motive for the alleged offences. However, in the totality of the circumstances, the existence of the conspiracy and the nexus between the applicant and the assailants are the matters for evidence and trial. The fact that the first informant and injured, prima facie, suffered simple injuries also bears upon the exercise of the discretion. The question as to whether the offence punishable under Section 307 of the Penal Code is made out is also a matter for trial," the Court further remarked as it granted bail to the applicant.
Appearances: Adv. Abhinav Chnadrachud, i/b Adv. Premkumar Pandey, a/w Adv. Khusboo Pathak, for the Applicant.
Case title - Raju Jokhanprasad Gupta v. State of Maharashtra [BAIL APPLICATION NO. 1406 OF 2022]

The Bench of Justice Vivek Chaudhary made this observation while setting aside a transfer order passed against a Class IV Employee as it noted that the same was punitive in nature. Essentially, the petitioner Smt. Maya (a Class IV Employee) was transferred by State Medical Health Department from Lucknow to Kanpur by transfer order dated July 12, 2021, on administrative grounds, however, the officer responsible for her transfer did not give any reason whatsoever for transferring her. Therefore, she approached the Allahabad High Court on the ground that Class-IV employee cannot be transferred so far away. Hearing her plea, the Court earlier directed that her representation against the said transfer order be considered and decided on merits. However, while deciding the representation, a large number of allegations were leveled against her including that she remains on leave, she acts in a whimsical manner which causes disturbances in the work, etc. Her counsel submitted before the Court that even presuming Class-IV employee is to be transferred on punishment, the same cannot be to a faraway place and has to be within the same district. It was further submitted is that the impugned order was also passed without providing any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. Agaisnt this backdrop, the Court noted that allegations had been leveled against her in rejecting her representation against the impugned transfer order, and therefore, the transfer order was punitive in nature. Therefore, stressing that no punishment can be awarded to the petitioner without giving any opportunity of hearing, the Court concluded that the impugned order can't stand. "It is further to be noted that no Class-IV employee should normally be transferred out of the district. The department itself follows the said policy as is reflected in the transfer order dated 12.07.2021 itself, by which five Class-IV employees are transferred, three of them on personal request out of district, the fourth in public interest within the district and fifth, petitioner, is transferred out of district on administrative grounds. When the department is making out of district transfer only on request and otherwise accommodating persons within the district, there was no reason to transfer the petitioner out of district," the Court further added as it set aside the impugned transfer order.

The Kerala High Court has accentuated on the fact that police officers must comply with the relevant statutory provisions/guidelines making it mandatory to wear the uniform while on duty except when it is permissible under law to deviate from the said mandatory requirement.
Justice Mohammed Nias C.P while quashing proceedings against a man for questioning an officer in plain clothes, reiterated that the requirement of the police officer to wear the uniform while on duty is to be enforced without exception.
The Court was hearing a plea filed by an advocate seeking to quash a final report filed against him for constructing and assaulting a police officer discharging his duty. 
The allegation in the report was that the petitioner shoved and abused a police officer on traffic duty who was seen pasting a sticker on his car parked near a 'No Parking' sign. 
However, the petitioner argued that the Civil Police Officer was not in his uniform, so he was not aware that it was an officer. Accordingly, seeing a man in plain clothes pasting a sticker on his car, the petitioner bonfaidely questioned the authority of the person. 
The Court found that since the police officer was not in his uniform while being on official duty, there was no question of the petitioner knowing that he was a police officer, and hence intention to obstruct his duties can not be established. 
In that context, it was held that no offence was committed by the petitioner and noting that the petitioner had remitted the fine imposed for parking his car in a no parking zone, the Court found that no further penalty was warranted in the matter.  
Accordingly, the final report lodged against the petitioner was quashed by the Court. 
Nevertheless, before parting with the case, the court emphasised on the necessity of the police force to wear the uniform while on duty with reference to the relevant statutory provisions.
"The uniform of a policeman is his direct identification. A policeman in uniform is visible and a citizen immediately knows that he is a policeman which will inform that the said individual is in charge of his protection and prevention of offences. It carries an undeniable symbolic value besides representing the State authority. The police uniform also symbolises pride, respect and authority over the citizens."
It was added that Sections 43 and 44 of the Kerala Police Act not only deals with the distinctive, exclusive and easily identifiable nature of the uniform or the vehicles used by the police but also states why it is so required. 
The Single Judge opined that it 'points to the importance of wearing uniform so as to make the police identifiable and in deference to the Kerala Police Act, Police Manual and Police Uniform Regulations.' 
It was further held that since police officers takes pride in their uniform and the visibility of a police officer is very critical for the police and the society, the requirement of wearing the same while on duty except where deviations are permissible shall be scrupulously observed. 
As such, the State Police Chief was directed to look into the matter and issue appropriate directions to ensure that the police officers comply with the relevant statutory provisions/guidelines making it mandatory to wear the uniform while on duty except when it is permissible under law to deviate from the said mandatory requirement. 
Advocate Arun Kumar P. appeared for the petitioner and Public Prosecutor Maya M.N for the respondent. 
Case Title: Avinash v. State of Kerala

The High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Gwalior Bench recently held that conducting a preliminary enquiry is not sine qua non for issuing a direction for prosecution U/S 195 CRPC and that the Applicant is not entitled for any opportunity of hearing prior to that.

The High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Gwalior Bench recently held that conducting a preliminary enquiry is not sine qua non for issuing a direction for prosecution U/S 195 CRPC and that the Applicant is not entitled for any opportunity of hearing prior to that.
 The single bench of Justice G.S. Ahluwalia was essentially dealing with a Criminal Revision against the order of the Additional Sessions Judge, wherein the appeal preferred by the Applicant against the dismissal of his application U/S 340 CRPC before Judicial Magistrate of First Class was rejected. 
 Brief facts of the case are that the Applicant was a seizure witness in a criminal case. During his examination before the trial court, he changed his stance on multiple occasions, thereby intentionally weakening the prosecution's case. The trial court, while passing the judgment, also directed that since the Applicant had intentionally changed his version, a complaint be filed under Section 340 CRPC for his prosecution under Section 195 IPC. Accordingly, a complaint was filed and an objection was raised by the Applicant by filing an application under Section 340 CRPC, submitting that since no preliminary enquiry was conducted, the complaint was not maintainable. The said application was rejected by JFMC, and an appeal preferred against the same by the Applicant was also dismissed by the ADJ.
 The Applicant's arguments were twofold: In the absence of preliminary enquiry, the direction to file complaint should not have been given. Further, the prosecution of every witness is not necessary merely on the ground that he has not supported the prosecution case.
 Examining the decision of the Apex Court in Pritish v. State of Maharashtra & Ors., the Court observed-
 Thus, where the Court is of the prima facie opinion that it is in the interest of justice to proceed against the witness for giving a false evidence, then holding of preliminary enquiry is not warranted. So far as the question of giving opportunity of hearing to the applicant before directing for his prosecution under Section 195 of CrPC, the said question is also no more res integra … the holding of preliminary enquiry is not sine qua non for issuing a direction for prosecution under Section 195 of CrPC and even the applicant is not entitled for any opportunity of hearing prior to that.
 The Court further noted that the Applicant was a member of Gram Raksha Samiti. He had certain statutory duties to follow. During the course of his evidence, he changed his version at every stage. Thus, this conduct of the Applicant was clearly indicative of the fact that the he had deliberately changed his version in order to help the accused. The Court held- 
 Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, coupled with the fact that the applicant is the member of Gram Raksha Samiti and has statutory duties to discharge and he deliberately changed his version with regard to the place from where the amount of Rs.80,000/- was seized from the accused Ramkumar, this Court is of the considered opinion that the Trial Court did not commit any mistake by directing to file a complaint for prosecution of the applicant. Furthermore, the Trial Magistrate did not commit any mistake by rejecting the application filed under Section 340 of CrPC. 
 Affirming the decision of the ADJ and the JFMC, the court directed the lower court to proceed further with the case and make every endeavour to conclude the trial within a period of one year. If further added that if the Applicant did not cooperate in the matter, the court below shall be free to take coercive action against him for ensuring the early disposal of the trial. The revision was accordingly dismissed. 
 Case Title: Laxman Rao Vs. Court of Third Additional Sessions Judge, Guna and anr. Case citation:  (MP) 26

The Delhi High Court has ruled that reimbursement of medical expenses under Central Government (Medical Attendance) Rules, 1944 cannot be denied on the ground that the hospital charged an amount in excess of the approved rates, in a case where the patient is referred to such hospital.
Expressing dismay at how a petition seeking reimbursement of only Rs 51, 824 remained pending for past 16 years and was vehemently contested by Delhi government, Justice Chandra Dhari Singh said the beneficiary employee cannot faulted or penalised to pay the excess amount that was charged from him by the Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute, when he in the first instance did not even choose the hospital but was referred there.
The petitioner, Mahendra Kumar Verma, was serving as a reader in the court of Metropolitan Magistrate in Tis Hazari Court, Delhi. The petitioner claimed medical advances for the medical treatment of his minor child who was suffering from brain tumour. The petitioner was issued a letter from the Drawing & Disbursing Officer, Officers of District and Sessions Judge, Delhi, asking him to deposit a sum of Rs. 51,854 against the medical advance of Rs. 2,34,000 granted to him from time to time for the medical treatment of his son in Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute.
 The representations made by the petitioner, as to why he should not be fully reimbursed for the medical expenses incurred for his son’s treatment, were rejected. Subsequently, the District & Session Judge passed an order for recovery of the amount from the petitioner’s salary. Verma in 2006 filed a writ petition, challenging the deductions made from his salary as well as the order seeking recovery of the amount.
 The government submitted before the High Court that the petitioner is entitled for medical reimbursement only in terms of the Central Services (Medical Attendance) Rules, 1944 (CS (MA) Rules) as well as the instructions issued by the Government of NCT of Delhi from time to time.
 The State further argued that after scrutinizing the medical bills submitted by the petitioner and calculating his entitlement as per the CS(MA) rules, it was found that the petitioner was entitled to a grant of only Rs. 1,82,146. Therefore, he was directed to deposit the excess amount of Rs. 51,854 sanctioned to him, the State contended.
 Verma's counsel contended that right to health is a constitutional right protected under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Thus, he argued that the government is under a constitutional mandate to reimburse the government servant the legitimate expenses incurred by him on the medical treatment received by him or his dependents.
 He averred that a government servant is entitled to full reimbursement, adding that reimbursement cannot be restricted to the rates specified in the circulars issued by the government. The petitioner further argued that he cannot be denied full reimbursement if the hospital has charged from him a rate exceeding the package deal rate. Thus, the petitioner contended that he was entitled to be fully reimbursed under the CS (MA) Rules for all the medical expenses incurred by him. 
 Referring to the CS (MA) Rules, 1944, the Court observed that the medical treatment availed by the government servant or his dependants has to be free of charge, and any amount that is paid by him on account of such medical attention or treatment has to be fully reimbursed to him.
"This Court is of the opinion that the medical attendance rules formulated by Central and State Governments are not merely the rules relating to medical attendance, but are the beneficiary piece of legislation to facilitate good and sound health for all the government employees and their families. It does not stand to reason as to why any impediments are read in the rules which have the tendency to defeat the cherished Constitutional rights for which this Court has always stood as a custodian," said the bench.
Referring to the Counter Affidavit filed by the State, the bench held that not even a single provision of law has been cited to justify the deductions made in the petitioner’s claim.
Ruling that the petitioner was entitled to be fully reimbursed for the expenses incurred by him in the medical treatment of his minor child.
 “The Respondents are directed to fully reimburse the Petitioner to the extent of bills raised by both the Hospitals, and to release the amount retained in the FDR, along with interest accrued from time to time, deducted from the salary or allowances of the Petitioner," the court said.

The Supreme Court observed that externment is not an ordinary measure and it must be resorted to sparingly and in extraordinary circumstances. 
The effect of the order of externment is of depriving a citizen of his fundamental right of free movement throughout the territory of India and therefore the restriction imposed by passing an order of externment must stand the test of reasonableness., the bench comprising Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S. Oka observed.
In this case, a resident of District Jalna was directed to remove himself outside the limits of District Jalna within 5 days. Invoking powers under Section 56(1)(a)(b) of the Maharashtra Police Act, 1951, the competent authority had passed this order of externment on the ground that his activities are very dangerous and the offences registered against him under the Indian Penal Code  are of grave and serious nature which are causing disturbance to the public at large. The Bombay High Court dismissed his writ petition challenging this order.
In appeal, the Apex Court bench, at the outset, observed thus: 
4..Under clause (d) of Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India, there is a fundamental right conferred on the citizens to move freely throughout the territory of India. In view of clause (5) of Article 19, State is empowered to make a law enabling the imposition of reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by clause (d). An order of externment passed under provisions of Section 56 of the 1951 Act imposes a restraint on the person against whom the order is made from entering a particular area. Thus, such orders infringe the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(d). Hence, the restriction imposed by passing an order of externment must stand the test of reasonableness.
7. There cannot be any manner of doubt that an order of externment is an extraordinary measure. The effect of the order of externment is of depriving a citizen of his fundamental right of free movement throughout the territory of India. In practical terms, such an order prevents the person even from staying in his own house along with his family members during the period for which this order is in subsistence. In a given case, such order may deprive the person of his livelihood. It thus follows that recourse should be taken to Section 56 very sparingly keeping in mind that it is an extraordinary measure.
Referring to Section 56 of the Maharashtra Police Act, the court observed that there must be objective material on record on the basis of which the competent authority must record its subjective satisfaction that the movements or acts of any person are causing or calculated to cause alarm, danger or harm to persons or property. 
"7...For passing an order under clause (b), there must be objective material on the basis of which the competent authority must record subjective satisfaction that there are reasonable grounds for believing that such person is engaged or is about to be engaged in the commission of an offence involving force or violence or offences punishable under Chapter XII, XVI or XVII of the IPC. Offences under Chapter XII are relating to Coin and Government Stamps. Offences under Chapter XVI are offences affecting the human body and offences under Chapter XVII are offences relating to the property. In a given case, even if multiple offences have been registered which are referred in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 56 against an individual, that by itself is not sufficient to pass an order of externment under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 56. Moreover, when clause (b) is sought to be invoked, on the basis of material on record, the competent authority must be satisfied that witnesses are not willing to come forward to give evidence against the person proposed to be externed by reason of apprehension on their part as regards their safety or their property. The recording of such subjective satisfaction by the competent authority is sine qua non for passing a valid order of externment under clause (b).", the court said.
The court added that though the competent authority is not expected to write a judgment containing elaborate reasons, it must record its subjective satisfaction of the existence of one of the grounds in sub-section (1) of Section 56 on the basis of objective material placed before it. The court said:
"10....Though the competent authority is not required to record reasons on par with a judicial order, when challenged, the competent authority must be in a position to show the application of mind. The Court while testing the order of externment cannot go into the question of sufficiency of material based on which the subjective satisfaction has been recorded. However, the Court can always consider whether there existed any material on the basis of which a subjective satisfaction could have been recorded. The Court can interfere when either there is no material or the relevant material has not been considered. The Court cannot interfere because there is a possibility of another view being taken. As in the case of any other administrative order, the judicial review is permissible on the grounds of mala fide, unreasonableness or arbitrariness."
Referring to materials on record, the bench found that, in this case, non-application of mind is apparent on the face of the record. The court added that if the order of externment for the maximum permissible period of two years is passed without recording subjective satisfaction regarding the necessity of extending the order of externment to the maximum permissible period, it will amount to imposing unreasonable restrictions on the fundamental right guaranteed under clause (d) of Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India.
"Perusal of the impugned Judgment and order of the High Court shows that unfortunately, the Division Bench did not notice that an order of externment is not an ordinary measure and it must be resorted to sparingly and in extraordinary circumstances. It was the duty of the Constitutional Court to test the said order within the parameters which are well-settled by this Court.", the bench said while allowing the appeal.

The Allahabad High Court recently disapproved of the approach of the sessions court in rejecting the bail application without application of judicial mind and in a routine manner in petty issues.
The bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Gupta observed that it is a very sorry state of affairs that in petty issues bail applications, the session courts deny bail to the accused, prompting them to move to the High Court for relief.
The Court was essentially dealing with the anticipatory bail application filed by one Rudra Dutt Sharma, a 60 year old man, who has been booked under sections- 147/353 IPC. It was his submission that no specific role was assigned to him and that the offence leveled against him is punishable by upto two years.
It was argued that after filing of charge-sheet, the applicant had moved the anticipatory bail application before the sessions court, however, the sessions court without appreciating the material available on record rejected the same and now, since he is having an apprehension of arrest, therefore, he sought anticipatory bail.
At the outset, the Court took into account the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Aman Preet Singh vs. C.B.I. through Director LL 2021 SC 416, wherein it was held that if a person, who is an accused in a non-bailable/cognizable offence, was not taken into custody during the period of investigation, in such a case, it is appropriate that he may be released on bail as the circumstances of his having not been arrested during the investigation or not being produced in custody is itself sufficient to entitle him to be released on bail.
In Aman Preet Singh Case, the Supreme Court had categorically observed that if a person has been enlarged and free for many years and has not even been arrested during the investigation, to suddenly direct his arrest and to be incarcerated merely because the charge sheet has been filed would be contrary to the governing principles for grant of bail.
In view of the law laid down by the Apex Court, the High Court took into account the facts and circumstances of the case as well as submissions advanced by counsel for the parties and decided to grant anticipatory bail to the accused.
The Court also made the following observations regarding the denial of bail pleas in petty issues:
"I am of the view that often it is seen that even in a petty issue, the sessions court rejects the bail application without application of judicial mind and in a routine manner. This is a very sorry state of affairs. Such type of bail application should be considered and decided by the session court. It is a fit case for grant of anticipatory bail to the applicant."

The Chhattisgarh High Court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Gautam Chourdiya has refused to grant bail to a person allegedly involved in availment of fraudulent Input Tax Credit (ITC).
The appellants created several fictitious and physically non-existent trading company firms in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Maharashtra, got them registered in GSTN portal online using identity credential of several persons using forged PAN and issued fake bills to transmit fake ITC to several other traders.
 It was alleged that the appellants had fraudulently shown in their GST returns to have procured several kinds of goods from within and across the State. The Directorate General of Goods and Service Tax Intelligence, Raipur Zonal Unit, Raipur cracked this racket on the basis of intelligence against a taxpayer, namely, M/s Manoj Enterprises, who during the month of July, 2020 and August, 2020, claimed Rs.44.72 crores from ITC by way of trading activities even when their statutory returns did not indicate purchase of any such goods for trade. 
 On the basis of information gathered, the appellants were arrested for the offence under Section 132(1)(b) & (c) of the Central Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017 from Raipur and produced before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Raipur.
 The appellants filed an application under Section 167(2) of CrPC for granting them default bail on the ground that despite the lapse of 60 days from the date of their judicial custody, no charge sheet was filed by the respondent/GST authority against them. The application was rejected by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Raipur which was subsequently affirmed by the revisional Court and the writ petition filed against the order was also dismissed by the Single Judge.
 The appellant contended that as per the Act of 2017, offence under Section 132 is a cognizable offence. There is no provision to file any complaint instead of a charge sheet. No FIR was lodged against the appellants, no investigation was conducted by the concerned police station, no charge sheet was filed against them under Section 173 of CrPC, as such, the learned Single Judge was in error in not enlarging the appellants on default bail.
 The court observed that the offence allegedly committed by the appellants is an economic offence. If on further investigation any new relevant fact or document comes within the knowledge of the investigating officer, he can file the supplementary report. So far as the appellants are concerned, the material collected against them during investigation as filed with the complaint are sufficient for establishing a prima facie case against them under Section 132(1)(b) & (c) of the CGST Act of 2017 and therefore, on filing of such complaint, the Magistrate has taken cognizance of the offence against them.
 The court held that though the complaint filed by respondent cannot be said to have been filed under Section 173 of CrPC but for the purpose of default bail, it can be said that respondent, who is an authorised officer under the CGST Act of 2017 to carry out investigation/enqiury, filed the complaint within the prescribed time limit which satisfies the requirement under Section 167 of CrPC and as such, no right accrues to the appellants to seek default bail under Section 167(2) of CrPC.
Case Title: Paritosh Kumar Singh Versus State Of Chhattisgarh 
Case No.: Writ Appeal No. 348 of 2021

Counsel For Petitioner: Advocate B.P. Sharma

The Delhi High Court on Thursday disposed of Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita's plea seeking various facilities of prisoners in Tihar jail. Narwal and Kalita are accused in the larger conspiracy case of the 2020 North-East riots.
Both Narwal and Kalita moved the plea in 2020 in wake of the restrictions imposed on account of COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting multiple issues faced by undertrials inside the prison. They were granted bail by High Court in June 2021, against which appeal is pending before the Supreme Court.
As Narwal and Kalita’s counsel expressed apprehension that the facilities might not be resumed to them if the Supreme Court cancels their bail, Justice Prathiba M Singh granted them liberty to approach court again if such a situation arises.
The court said that no further orders are required to be passed in the matter, considering that the restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 are not applicable anymore and that the plea primarily dealt with facilities to be provided during the pandemic. 
“The petition has run its course….it has become infructuous now,” the court said. 
The court noted that the circular issued by Tihar jail on December 26 last year clearly states that the calling facility will be available to foreign inmates unless they are covered under the exception. The Delhi Prison Rules exclude prisoners involved in offences against the State, terrorist activities, MCOCA, National Security Act, Public Safety Act and otherwise involved in multiple heinous offences, from the facility in the interest of public safety and order.
The court in May 2021 passed a slew of directions on facilities to be provided to jail inmates including tele-calling facility, vaccination,e-mulaqats, monthly charges for calling facilities, physical mulaqats, IT infrastructure and computer centre in jail and legal aid. 
However, during the course of hearings, the court was also considering the issue of extending the e-mulaakat facility to the foreign prisoners. 
Superintendent of Tihar Jail told the court that the facility of e-mulaakat is not being extended to the foreign prisoners due to security reasons. However, it said that telephonic voice calls are allowed once a week to inmates whose family members are residing abroad, on request.

The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday refused to interfere in a dispute over the citizenship of a Hindu man, claiming to have converted his religion from Islam, by observing that no relief can be granted under Article 226 of the Constitution. The petitioner had challenged a show cause notice dated January 27, 2022 issued by the UIDAI stipulating that his Aadhar Card would be deactivated if he fails to provide any decision authenticating his citizenship or residence in India. Dismissing the plea, Justice Rajasekhar Mantha observed, 
"In the above circumstances, the petitioner is not entitled to any relief under Article 226 of the Constitution of India with regard to his Aadhar Card or its proposed de activation." In the instant case, the petitioner claimed to be born to a Muslim family in Kolkata in the year 1982 and to have subsequently changed his name and religion to Hinduism in order to get married. He was residing in Mumbai and had also obtained a Passport and an Aadhar Card from Mumbai. The petitioner claimed that he frequently visited Bangladesh and on one such trip while returning to India, he was apprehended at the border Check Post, at Haridaspur, Petrapole. Discrepancies were found in his documentation and notice was sent to the Regional Passport Office, Mumbai. Consequently, an FIR was registered against him and a charge sheet was also filed under various provisions of the IPC and under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act. The petitioner's passport was thereafter revoked by the RPO, Mumbai and an appeal is pending in this regard. The counsel for the petitioner contended that the entire case against him by the Immigration Officer at Petrapole is baseless. He therefore sought quashing of the entire proceedings. It was also submitted that the order of bail itself granted to the petitioner would itself clearly indicate that he was born in Kolkata. Upon a perusal of the submissions, Justice Mantha noted that a statutory authority had found discrepancies in the petitioner's passport and accordingly remarked, 
"This Court notes that there is a finding by an authority constituted statute of discrepancies in the petitioner's passport based on which it has been revoked. There is also charge sheet filed against the petitioner under the appropriate penal laws referred to herein above." While refusing to quash the impending proceedings against the petitioner, the Court underscored that the order should not stand in the way of the Appellate Authority considering the petitioner's appeal under the Passport Act. 
The Allahabad High Court
 has held that the Magistrate has the power to enforce an order of maintenance passed under Section 125 Cr.P.C. by issuing a warrant to the Collector to recover the same as arrears of land revenue.
The bench of Justice J. J. Munir clarified that if read conjointly, 
Section 125(3) and Section 421 give power to the Magistrate to issue a warrant to the Collector for recovering the defaulted maintenance as arrears of land revenue.
The case in brief
One Usha Devi obtained ex-parte order against the plaintiff (appellant herein) for getting maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C. in the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate, Kanpur Nagar in January 1982. The plaintiff got to know about the ex parte order and thus, he made an application to the Metropolitan Magistrate, Kanpur Nagar seeking to set aside the sale. The same was allowed in May 1982 and the ex parte maintenance order was set aside.
In the meantime, the defendant purchased the plaintiff's immovable property in December 1982. Thereafter, the plaintiff's wife applied for the recovery of dues under the ex parte maintenance order. 
Now, it was the plaintiff's case that after the maintenance order had been set aside in May 1982, the sale of the plaintiff's property in December 1982 was one made without jurisdiction, as there was no maintenance order in existence then to execute.
After his suit was dismissed by the District Judge of Varanasi, he moved to the High Court arguing that it was not open to the Magistrate, who had the execution of the ex parte maintenance order before him, to enforce it by forwarding a recovery certificate to the Collector.
As such, it was argued that all proceedings taken by the Revenue Authorities at Varanasi, pursuant to the recovery certificate issued by the Magistrate for enforcement of the ex parte maintenance order, were without jurisdiction.
On the other hand, the defendant who brought the property in question argued that there was jurisdiction under the law available to the Magistrate to issue a recovery certificate to the Collector by virtue of the provisions of Section 125(3) CrPC.
High Court's order
At the outset, the Court conjointly read Sections 125(3) and 421(1) of the CrPC to note that it is open to the Magistrate to enforce an order of maintenance that remains uncomplied with, for every breach of it, by the issue of a warrant for levying the amount due in the manner provided for levying fines
"It is the discretion of the Magistrate, before whom an application for enforcement of the maintenance order comes up, either to issue a warrant for the levy of the amount by attachment and sale of movables of the defaulter under Section 421(1)(a) of the Code, or to issue a warrant to the Collector, authorizing him to realize the amount as arrears of land revenue. It is open to issue both kind of warrants simultaneously also," the Court remarked.
The Court further noted that Sub-Section (3) of Section 421 obliges the Collector, whenever a warrant is issued to him, to recover any amount, that qualifies for a fine, as arrears of land revenue in accordance with the law, treating the warrant to be a recovery certificate issued under the law relating to land revenue recovery.
Against this backdrop, the Court rejected the argument of the plaintiff that the Magistrate had no power to issue a warrant to the Collector for the recovery of the amount of maintenance in default as arrears of land revenue. In view of this, the appeal failed and was dismissed with costs.

The Allahabad High Court on Monday directed departmental action against the Assistant Registrar of the High Court who failed to list a particular case in the fresh list and send the case file to the court citing various administrative instructions and remained defiant even when enquired by the HC about his failure to perform his duty.
Significantly, when the Bench of Justice Ajay Bhanot called him personally and asked him about the lapse on his part, he reiterated his stand that the order cannot be complied with due to administrative instructions. 
Against this backdrop, noting that he remained defiant, the Bench ordered departmental action against him after terming his conduct as interfering with the administration of justice.
"...the Court cannot remain silent spectator to such acts of grave misconduct and deliberate defiance of orders passed by this Court by officers of the registry. Such conduct interferes with the administration of justice. In case such officials are given free run, public at large will lose faith in the judicial system," the Court further remarked.
The case in brief 
The Court was dealing with the bail plea of one Dlshad @ Dillu who has booked under Sections 147, 148, 149, 302, 506 IPC. During the hearing of the case, the Court noted the impediment created by the registry official (Sandeep Kumar, Assistant Registrar, deputed in the fresh filing section) in the hearing.
Essentially, a specific order was passed by the Court on January 19, 2022 (Wednesday) directing that the constant bail plea be placed in the list of fresh cases on January 20, 2022 (Thursday), however neither the list of fresh cases depicting the aforesaid case was prepared nor the file was sent to the court. 
Therefore, the Bench Secretary of the Court enquired from the said official about his failure to prepare the list of fresh cases depicting the said case and also not sending the file to the Court, and the said official replied that the order was not liable to be complied with due to various administrative instructions and refused to send the file or prepare the list. 
Thereafter, when this issue was brought to the notice of the Court, the Court directed that the official be summoned and appearing for the Court, the said official reiterated his stand by stating that the order cannot be complied with due to administrative instructions. 
Since he remained defiant and reiterated his stand, the Court summoned the Registrar General of this Court, who ensured prompt compliance of orders of the Court. 
Lastly, calling the conduct of the said official as clearly contumacious, the Court remarked that it would be open to the High Court to consider whether relaxing of qualitative requirements and eligibility criteria for appointments and promotion to responsible posts in the registry of this Court is conducive to the good administration of justice or not.

Observing that intention to cause disorder or incite people to violence is the sine qua non for the offence under Section 153-A, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has granted bail to Congress Leader Karamjit Singh Gill, who was arrested in August for wearing a t-shirt with picture of 1984 riots-accused Jagdish Tytler at Golden Temple.
While the case registered under Section 153-A by Amritsar police accuses Gill of hurting the Sikh sentiments with his actions, Justice Sandeep Moudgil said mere wearing of a T-shirt with a picture "of one on his favorite person with the words 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO OUR BELOVED GOD FATHER' ... does not reflect any incriminating material or provocative act on the part of the petitioner to bring the case within the ambit of Section 153-A IPC"
The court said no iota of evidence has come forth even in the challan against the accused with regard to uttering of any word or by any other means which may cause hurt to the feelings of a particular community.
Observing that except wearing of a T-shirt with "a photograph of a leader of his own party", no overt act has been attributed against the accused, the court said there is no material whatsoever even to infer that the petitioner was acting under any pre-oriented plan as alleged or to suggest that by words either spoken or written or by any other means as enumerated under Section 153-A IPC, he incited anyone to create violence or promote communal hatred.
"The intention to cause disorder or incite people to violence is the sine qua non of the offence under Section 153-A IPC and there is no existence of mens rea for the prosecution to succeed," said the court.
The bench placed reliance on the Supreme Court decisions in Patricia Mukhim v. State of Meghalaya and Others, AIR 2021 SC 1632 and Balwant Singh and Another v. State of Punjab, (1995) 3 SCC 214 in the bail order.
Finding that prima facie no material exists to constitute an offence punishable under Section 153-A IPC, the court said benefit of bail can be extended to the accused. The court also noted that challan has already been filed in the case and the accused has remained in custody for three months and 23 days.
The FIR was registered on August 17 on the basis of the complaint lodged by Sulkhan Singh, Manager, Sach Khand Shri Harmandir Sahib, Shri Darbar Sahib, Amritsar.
 As per the FIR, the applicant after taking a dip in the holy water at the Golden Temple "wore a t-shirt having picture of Jagdish Tytler, an accused of 1984 Sikh Genocide," clicked a photograph wearing it and left without paying obeisance. 
 Senior Counsel Anmol Rattan Sidhu, representing the accused, submitted before the court that the petitioner was implicated on false and baseless allegations in the case. 
Relying on the Supreme Court decision in Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar; (2014) 8 SCC 273, Sidhu contended that since offences under Sections 153-A IPC Part-I and Part II carried punishments of (i) upto three years or fine or both, and (ii) punishment of upto five years and fine, respectively; notice under Section 41A CrPC should have been served and opportunity should have been given to the applicant to join the investigation. 
 Calling the FIR being politically motivated, Sidhu also contended that offence under Section 153A was not made out as none of the ingredients laid therein were met, not even prima facie, from the bare language of the FIR. 
 Senior Counsel P.S. Hundal appearing on behalf of the complainant, on the other hand, contended that Jagdish Tytler was an accused in 1984 Sikh Genocide. The petitioner knowing the fact fully well "deliberately with an intent to hurt the sentiments of Sikhs" wore the T-shirt and after taking a dip in the holy pond clicked his photograph, Hundal submitted. The court was told that such an act of the accused was part of "a well planned conspiracy to disturb the peaceful atmosphere".
 Deputy Advocate General Rajiv Verma submitted that the petitioner did not deserve the concession of bail since he had committed a serious offence under Section 153A of the IPC. He submitted that the FIR was filed, not on the basis of mere suspicion, but on the basis of CCTV footage. 
"His role was evident from the fact that he was wearing a t-shirt having picture of Jagdish Tytler, prime accused in 1984 Sikh Genocide. Further, he also sent his picture from his mobile phone to some person with the intention to make the same viral," argued the DAG.

Punjab and Haryana High Court recently held that where the claim of a party to an agreement is based upon a Memorandum of Understanding which does not contain an arbitration clause, the Court is not required to refer the matter merely because the subsequent Consulting Agreements executed by the parties contemplate arbitration.
 The bench comprising Justice Augustine George Masih and Justice Sandeep Moudgil in this case noted that there is no clause for arbitration under the MoU and the clause, if any, is in the Consulting Agreements which would not be applicable here since plaintiff's claim is based exclusively on the MoU.
 The court was dealing with an appeal wherein the order of Commercial Court rejecting the first defendant's application under Order VII Rule 11 (d) of the CPC read with Section 8 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 for rejection of the plaint in terms of Clause 16 in the Consulting Agreement, was challenged. 
 The counsel for the appellant contended that the Court below has misread the provisions of the agreements which have been entered into between the parties.
 The court noted that the working relationship of the parties is governed by the Memorandum of Understanding dated 17.03.2017. Memorandum of Understanding stated that the respondent No.1 – plaintiff would support the appellant – defendant No.1 on their quantity surveying business in United Kingdom for a period of five years and was renewable in march, 2022. 
 The court further noted that the basis for working relationship governing the conduct between the parties was the Memorandum of Understanding and not the Purchase Orders.
 Regarding the arbitration clause in the agreement the court noted that it is not in dispute that under the Memorandum of Understanding, there is no clause for arbitration. The clause, if any, is in the Consulting Agreements which would not be applicable since the claim of respondent No.1 – plaintiff is based exclusively on the Memorandum of Understanding. 
 In the given facts and circumstances, the court opined that the dispute and the claims which have been made in the civil suit when do not flow from the Purchase Orders or Consulting Agreements, cannot be made the basis for rejection of the suit and similarly, the question of separation of the claims does not arise. 
 Further, the claim which is based upon an agreement, in which there is no arbitration clause, would not bound the parties. The plea of the appellant that the suit deserves to be dismissed as there is an arbitration clause, therefore, cannot sustain.
 According, there being no merit in the present appeal, the same stands dismissed.

The Allahabad High Court on Tuesday granted bail to the Senior Samajwadi Party leader and a Member Of Parliament, Azam Khan in connection with a case registered against him for allegedly making derogatory statements against BJP, RSS by way of misusing his official letterhead and seal as a UP Minister.
Noting that Khan has been in jail since February 2020, a charge-sheet has been submitted against him and the trial Court has taken cognizance of it, the Bench of Justice Ramesh Sinha was of the view that his continued custody isn't necessary for the purpose of further investigation and trial in the instant case and therefore, he was granted bail. 
However, Khan will continue to be in jail in connection with other cases registered against him.
The case against Khan
Essentially, an F.I.R. was lodged by one Allama Jamir Naqbi against Khan in February 2019 alleging that the Khan, while sitting in his Ministerial office intentionally wrote certain letters dated in August 2014 on the letter pad of the office and also wrote a letter on a blank paper bearing his signatures at the footer, defaming R.S.S., B.J.P., and Maulana Sayyed Kalbe Jawwad Naqbi.
It was further alleged that the same was published in the National Newspaper and various T.V. national news channels by the pressure and high-end networks of the applicant. A charge sheet was submitted under S. 505 (2) [Statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes] against him on which cognizance was taken.
Submissions of Khan's counsel
Before the Court, Khan's counsel argued that the alleged incident pertains to the year 2014, but the F.I.R. in the matter had been lodged on in Feb 2019 i.e. almost after five years without explaining the inordinate delay. 
It was his further submission that the F.I.R. had been registered in utter ignorance to the bar of limitation as provided under Section 468 of Cr.P.C. inasmuch as the offences alleged against the applicant entail maximum imprisonment of upto 3 years and, as such, the limitation period as provided under Section 468 Cr.P.C. for the offence of three years is only till three years.
It was also argued that on March 5, 2022, a charge-sheet had been filed against the applicant for the offence punishable under Section 505 (2) I.P.C. only and the Court concerned had taken cognizance on it and therefore, even assuming that the applicant is convicted for the offence punishable under Section 505 (2) I.P.C., then, the maximum sentence is to be awarded to him by the Court as per the statute is three years or with fine or with both.
Lastly, it was submitted that 87 criminal cases have already been registered against the applicant on false, concocted, and vexatious allegations. However, out of 87 criminal cases, the applicant has been enlarged on bail in 84 cases.
Consequently, the Court directed that Mohammad Azam Khan be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Court concerned.

The Delhi High Court has observed that matters regarding liberty of a person have to be dealt with cautiously and that a balance has to be struck between respect for his fundamental rights and free and fair investigation as well.
Justice Swarna Kanta Sharma made the observation while granting bail to a man in an FIR registered under sec. 376D, 506 and 34 of Indian Penal Code. 
It was the case of the complainant, real sister of the petitioner, that the incident in question had allegedly taken place in March 2019. When a query was put to the counsel for the complainant regarding reason for the delay in lodging of the FIR, it was stated that since it was a sensitive relationship, at the instance of their father who had unfortunately passed away in October, 2021, the complainant did not lodge any complaint. 
It was stated that the prestige of the family was paramount for her and that after passing away of her father and after consultation with her husband the present FIR was lodged in April, 2022 i.e. after about three years of the alleged incident. No other reason was put forth by the State or the counsel for the complainant.
The Court was of the view that it has to remain conscious and keep in mind that the case involved sexual assault of the real sister by two brothers and also involvement of the wife of the petitioner who had allegedly stood guard outside the room where the alleged incident had taken place. 
"I am of the view that prima facie there is delay of three years in lodging of the present FIR and in the statement under Section 164 it is mentioned that since her father had requested her not to disclose the same, she had refrained from lodging the FIR," the Court said. 
The Court was also of the prima facie view that was is the case of the complainant herself that after giving careful thought for three years, she had lodged the FIR. 
"Therefore while the FIR was neither lodged in a hurry nor under threat, the video recording still did not find mention in the FIR," it noted further. 
At the outset, the Court observed:
"However, in view of the rulings of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in various cases, it is not merely the seriousness of the allegations levelled but also the facts and circumstances of the case that need to be examined, as to whether in case the accused is released on bail, he would flee from justice or not and if he would cooperate in the investigation or would attempt to influence the witnesses or tamper with evidence, and if he would participate as and when the trial commences."
"Matters regarding liberty of a person have to be dealt with cautiously, a balance has to be struck between respect for his fundamental rights and free and fair investigation as well."
It was argued by the counsel appearing for the petitioner that he was a practicing Advocate and there was no question of him leaving the country or not abiding with any condition imposed by this Court in case he is granted bail.
Accordingly, bail was granted by the Court. 
Case Title: NIZAMUDDIN KHAN v. THE STATE & ANR.

The Delhi High Court on Friday held that the report of Public Prosecutor is not required to be provided to the accused at the stage of grant of extension of remand for continued investigation under section 43D(2) of UAPA. 
A division bench of Justice Mukta Gupta and Justice Anish Dayal however said that when the accused is produced to inform him about the extension of period of investigation based on Public Prosecutor’s report, “the accused cannot be a silent spectator” and the Special Court would be required to take into consideration, submissions on behalf of the accused, while examining the report regarding progress of investigation and the reasons for seeking further detention. 
“The Special Court would also be required to satisfy itself, from the investigation carried out that there is sufficient material to form a reasonable belief that prima facie an offence under UAPA is made out, though no reasons in this regard will be required to be reflected in the order as the same would entail disclosure of the investigation carried out,” it said. 
As per Section 43D(2), in cases where it is not possible to complete the investigation within a period of 90 days, the Court may extend the period of detention of the accused upto 180 days. The court may do so on being satisfied with the report of the Public Prosecutor indicating the progress of the investigation and the specific reasons for the detention of the accused beyond the period of 90 days, as per the provision.
The bench said that the Designated Courts should always carefully consider the material available on record and apply their mind to ascertain whether on the material collected by the investigating agency, provisions of UAPA are even prima facie attracted or not. 
“This is all the more essential for the reason that in case the provision of UAPA itself is prima facie not attracted, the Designated Court has no jurisdiction to either grant the remand or extend the remand as contemplated under Section 43D(2)(b) of UAPA,” it said. 
The bench also enumerated three essential ingredients to form part of the Public Prosecutor’s report, based on which the Special Court would arrive at the satisfaction to extend the period of remand. The elements are:
- Reasons evidencing the personal satisfaction of the Public Prosecutor as regards the progress of investigation made based on the investigation carried out. 
- Reasons indicating why the investigation could not be completed within the period of 90 days; and,
- Further investigation required to be carried out for which, extended period of time is necessary.
Whether report of the Public Prosecutor is required to be furnished to accused?
Observing that a Public Prosecutor is required to carry out the said function fairly, impartially, objectively and within the framework of the provisions of the law, the court said that the Public Prosecutor has, at all times, to ensure that the accused is tried fairly. 
“He should consider the legitimate interest and possible concern of the witnesses and victims. He is supposed to refuse evidence reasonably believed to have been obtained through recourse to unlawful methods,” it said. 
It added that if the Public Prosecutor finds that the investigation has not progressed in the proper manner or that there has been unnecessary, deliberate or avoidable delay in completing the investigation, he may refuse to submit any report to the court to seek extension of time.
“Issue No.I is thus answered in the negative and it is held that the report of the Public Prosecutor cannot be furnished to the accused at the time of extension of remand for a further period of 90 days under proviso to sub- Section 2(b) of Section 43D of UAPA,” it said. 
Necessary requirements to extend the period of remand
The court observed that before an order is passed by the Special Court while exercising the power under proviso to section 43D(2)(b) of UAPA, it has to satisfy itself that all the above four ingredients are complied with.
It added that the Public Prosecutor’s report must indicate the progress of investigation carried out, that there was no unnecessary, deliberate or avoidable delay and what further investigation is required to be carried out by the State to file a proper charge sheet.
Whether the period of remand should be extended in one go?
The court said that a bare reading of the provision of section 167 Cr.P.C. and section 43D(2)(b) of UAPA uses the word “in whole”, thus, even if there is no bar to grant an extension for a further period of 90 days in one go, while granting the extension of time, it is incumbent on the Special Court to see as to how much further time is reasonably required to complete the investigation.
“If on the facts of a given case, further investigation can be completed within a period of 30 days or 45 days, the Special Court will not grant an extension of 90 days, but for the said 30 or 45 days, subject to the right of the prosecution to seek further extension if so necessary as per the provision,” the court said. 
The bench said that whenever extension is granted by the Special Court upto the total of further period of 90 days, the same has to be based on the fresh report of the Public Prosecutor. 
“Such an approach will strike an equitable balance between the right of accused from not suffering meaningless continued detention without investigation and the right of the investigating agency to conclude the investigation fairly, covering all facets,” it said. 
About the Appeals
One of the pleas moved by Zeeshan Qamar argued that the proviso to Section 43D (2)(b) of UAPA establishes the threshold of impossibility to complete investigation within a period of ninety days.
The plea challenged the trial court's order of granting an extension under Section 43D(2)(b) of the UAPA in his case. Qamar was arrested from his residence in Uttar Pradesh in September last year in an FIR related to existence of an alleged terror module.
Another plea was moved by Mohd. Manan Dar, a Kashmir based freelance photojournalist, against a trial court order which granted an extension of 90 days under Section 43D(2) of the UAPA for completion of investigation.
It also sought consequential directions for Dar's release on default bail under Section 167(1) of CrPC for the reason that the investigating agency failed to file a charge sheet within 90 days of his arrest.
The court dismissed the appeals. However, the bench granted default bail to appellants Mushab Anwar and Rahees Rasheed under section 167(2) Cr.P.C. 
“We place on record our appreciation for the assistance rendered by Mr.S.V. Raju, Mr.Vikramjit Banerjee, learned ASGs, Mr.Gautam Narayan, Mr.Akshai Malik, Special Public Prosecutors, Ms.Shahrukh Alam, Mr.Jawahar Raja, Mr.Ashok Aggarwal, Md.Irshad Hanif and Ms.Tara Narula, Advocates,” the court said. 
The appellants were represented by Advocates Shahrukh Alam and Ahmad Ibrahim, Tara Narula, Tamanna Pankaj, Priya Vats, Jawahar Raja, Varsha Sharma and Archit Krishna.

The Allahabad High Court recently upheld an order of the Trial Court dismissing a discharge application filed by a man who has been accused of abetting wife's suicide. The wife had died by suicide allegedly on account of the fact that without divorcing her, her husband was going to marry another lady.
Stressing that an Indian lady can't share her husband at any cost, the Bench of Justice Rahul Chaturvedi observed thus while dismissing the revision plea filed by the Husband:
"They (Indian wives) are literally possessive about their husband. It would be biggest jolt for any married woman that her husband is being shared by some other lady or he is going to marry some other lady. In such awkward situation, it would be impossible to expect any sanity from them. Exactly, same thing happen in this case too, where soon after coming to know that her husband got married in clandestine way with some other lady, by itself is more than sufficient reason to commit suicide."
The case in brief
During her lifetime, the deceased had lodged the instant FIR against her husband-accused (Sushil Kumar) and all his family members in September 2018, under sections 323, 494, 504, 506, 379 IPC.
She had alleged that the accused was already married with some other lady and having two children from her and without divorcing her, he married for the third time. Soon after their marriage, when this fact came to the knowledge of other family members (other accused persons), they started misbehaving with her, tortured and abused her.
Allegedly, when their atrocities crossed all the limits, and when the accused-husband deserted her and kept a new lady, she decided to filed the instant FIR. However, soon thereafter, she consumed poisonous substance and died.
After the death of the victim, the Police intensified the investigation in the case and filed a chargesheet. Hence, the Husband and his relatives moved a discharge plea before the Additional Sessions Judge, Varanasi which was dismissed, challenging the same, they moved to the HC with their revision plea.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court noted that the accused-husband had admitted that he got married third time in Sepetmebr 2018. The Court also noted that it was apparent that the sole reason behind the the extreme step taken by the deceased was husban'd third marriage.
Regarding dimisssal of the discharge application, the Court opined that if Sections 227 [Discharge] and 228 [Framing of charge] of Cr.P.C. are read conjointly, it becomes clear that at the beginning and the initial stage of the trial, the truth, veracity and effect of the evidence which the prosecutor proposes to adduce are not to be meticulously judged at the stage of discharge. 
"...there shall be more than prima facie case against the accused for which he is required to be tried. There is sufficient ample material against the accused. The alleged anomalies or inconsistencies during investigation (a third agency) would not be of much relevance at the stage of discharge. The nature of accusation in the FIR and during investigation material collected by the Investigating Officer and its cumulative effect in its nascent form is the material on which discharge has to be decided," the Court further added.
Reverting to the facts of the case, the Court noted that the deceased had lodged the FIR as soon as she got to know about husban'd second marriage and therefore, the FIR could be considered as her dying declaration as the deceased herself is the author of the FIR as after lodging of the FIR, she died by suicide just next day.
The court also stressed that the lady was fixed in an awkward situation, and therefore, it would be impossible to expect any sanity from them. 
"Exactly, same thing happen in this case too, where soon after coming to know that her husband got married in clandestine way with some other lady, by itself is more than sufficient reason to commit suicide," the Court said.
Consequently, holding that at the stage of DISCHARGE, the Court are not expected to have roving inquiry about the material collected during investigation or its impact on the trial, the Court dismissed the instant revision plea filed by the husband.
Case title - Sushil Kumar And 6 Others v. State of U.P. and Another [CRIMINAL REVISION No. - 1092 of 2022]

In a case dating back to 1999, the Delhi High Court has set aside the life sentence of a murder convict after he took the plea of juvenility during the pendency of his appeal. The ossification test revealed that his age was between 10 to 20 years old on the day of incident.
"Considering the fact that the upper age limit cannot be taken to the detriment of the appellant and as per the lower limit, the appellant was a minor at the time of alleged incident, he is entitled to the benefit of juvenility. The appellant was convicted for offences punishable under Sections 302/452 IPC as noted above. Maintaining the conviction of the appellant for the said offences, which is not being challenged on merits before this Court, the order on sentence is set aside," said the court.
The division bench of Justice Mukta Gupta and Justice Anish Dayal in the judgment dated November 23 further observed that in any case the conviction "will have no disqualification at any stage against the appellant in terms of Section 24 of the J.J.Act."
The convict had been in custody for nearly five years and five months when his sentence was directed to be suspended on April 13 in 2005. "Even as a juvenile the period of protective custody for rehabilitation that could be awarded was three years. Hence, this Court finds no ground to remand the matter to the Juvenile Justice Board on the order on sentence in terms of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported as (2013) 11 SCC 193 Jitendra Singh Vs. State of U.P," the court said.
The appellant in 2005 had challenged the trial court decision of July 5, 2004 by which the accused was convicted for offences punishable under Sections 302 and 452 IPC. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on July 9, 2005. In 2019, he took the plea of juvenility before the high court.
Since the Supreme Court in Hari Ram Vs. State of Rajasthan and Anr held that the benefit of the increase of the age of the juvenility to 18 years introduced by the JJ Act of 2000 will apply retrospectively, it was thus to be determined whether the appellant had completed 18 years of age on the date of alleged commission of offence to avail the benefit of the J.J. Act, the court noted.
The bench had earlier remanded the matter to the trial court for determination of the age of appellant as on November 6 in 1999 - the date of incident. Since neither the date of birth from the school nor the certificate issued by the municipal corporation was available, a medical board was constituted by the Additional Sessional Judge in December 2019.
The medical board conducted physical, radiological and dental as also orthopedic examinations of the appellant. Though the appellant had also submitted his Aadhaar and PAN cards, they were not considered.
"The appellant also had submitted his Aadhar Card and PAN Card whereby his date of birth was mentioned as 1st January 1983. However, the said documents were not on the basis of any record from the school or municipal authority. Hence, in terms of Section 94 of the J.J.Act, the age of the appellant will have to be ascertained as per the ossification test conducted and opined by the Medical Board to be between 30 to 40 years as on 18th December 2019, which makes the age of the appellant on the date of incident i.e. 6th November 1999 to be between 10 years to 20 years," the bench said, while granting relief to the convict.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has observed that without the transcript of the conversations exchanged between the co-accused, mere call details would not be considered to be corroborative material in absence of substantive material found against the accused in a case under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.
The Bench of Justice Vikas Bahl observed thus while relying upon Gujarat High Court's recent order in the case of Yash Jayeshbhai Champaklal Shah v. State of Gujarat  (Guj) 66, wherein it was held that mere contacts with the co-accused who were found in possession cannot be treated to be a corroborative material in absence of substantive material found against the accused in NDPS Cases.
The case in brief
Essentially, the court was dealing with the bail pleas filed by 3 NDPS Act accused [Vikrant Singh, Subash Chander @ Bittu, and Davinder Singh] who argued before the Court that no recovery had been made from them and the alleged recovery had been made from two other persons/co-accused.
It was further submitted by their Counsels that the petitioners were implicated in the case solely on the basis of the disclosure statement of both the co-accused (Rakesh Sharma and Ravdeep Singh @ Sheru) and even subsequent to the disclosure statement, no recovery had been effected from the petitioners.
Lastly, it was also argued by them that they are not involved in any other case and they are in custody since 06.11.2020 (Vikrant Singh), 05.12.2020 (Subash Chander) and 23.04.2021 (Davinder Singh) and in the instant case, the investigation is complete and the challan has been presented. There are 32 witnesses, out of which, one witness has been partially examined, thus, the trial is likely to take time.
On the other hand, the State opposed the petitioners' instant petition for regular bail by submitting that there are call details of conversations exchanged between the three petitioners and the two co-accused, from whom the recovery has been effected.
In response to this argument, the counsels for the petitioner argeud that the prosecution, in its charges sheet, had not given any details as to on what date, the alleged calls had been exchanged, and at any rate, it was further submitted, there is no transcript of the said call details.
Court's observations and order
At the outset, the Court observed that the prosecution had not given the details of dates on which the said calls had been allegedly made by the co-accused, to the petitioners or vice-versa, and moreover, even the transcript of the said conversations was not a part of the record under Section 173 Cr.P.C.
In view of this, taking into account the Gujarat HC's ruling in the case of Yash Jayeshbhai Champaklal Shah (supra), the Court allowed the plea of the petitioners and ordered them to be released on bail on their furnishing bail/surety bonds to the satisfaction of the concerned trial Court/Duty Magistrate.
Advocates Sumer Singh Boparai, and Sidhant Saraswat appeared for the petitioner (CRM-M-39657 of 2020).  Advocate Dinesh Treha appeared for the petitioner (CRM-M-28448 of 2021). Advocate Varinder Basa appeared for the petitioner (CRM-M-26760 of 2021). AAG, Punjab Sarabjit Singh Cheema appeared for the respondent state. 
Case title - Vikrant Singh v. State of Punjab and connected matters

Citing non-compliance with Section 8 of the Gujarat Cinemas (Regulation) Act, 2004 and violation of principles of natural justice, the Gujarat High Court has quashed and set aside an order passed by the District Magistrate, Ahmedabad cancelling the licence of 'K News Channel'.
 Section 8 provides that the licence may be revoked in the event of any contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules made thereunder, or of any conditions or restrictions subject to which the licence has been granted, or in case of conviction under Section 13 or Section 7 of the Act or section 7 of the Cinematograph Act, 1952. The proviso states that no licence shall be revoked or suspended unless the holder has been given reasonable opportunity to show cause.
 Mr. Rahul Sharma, appearing on behalf of the Petitioner, argued that the impugned order was absolutely silent with regard to violation of any of the conditions of the licence. He also put forth that no reasonable opportunity to show cause was provided, as is required under Section 8. Relying on several judicial precedents, he argued that the writ filed was maintainable, although the Petitioner had the remedy to file an appeal.
 The Respondent did not dispute that the impugned order revoking the licence granted to the petitioners had been passed without issuing any show cause notice.
 Justice A.S. Supehia found that the District Magistrate, while cancelling the Petitioner's licence, had relied on the registration of FIR for offences mentioned therein. However, the impugned order fails to reference any conditions which had been violated. Moreover, Section 8 requires conviction under Section 13 or Section 7 of the Act or section 7 of the Cinematograph Act, 1952, but the order was passed on the basis of an FIR. Thus, the Court found a total non-application of mind by the District Magistrate in passing of the order.
 The Court also delved into the issue of maintainability of the writ. The Court acknowledged that an alternative remedy to appeal is available to the petitioners under the Act, particularly, Sections 10 and 11 of the Act. Citing the Supreme Court case of Radha Kirshan Industries Vs. State of Himachal Paresh and others (SCC OnLine SC 334), the Court listed the principles governing the exercise of writ jurisdiction by the High Court in the presence of an alternate remedy and the exceptions to it. The judgment reads as follows:
 "Exceptions to the rule of alternate remedy arise where:
 (a) the writ petition has been filed for the enforcement of a fundamental right protected by Part III of the Constitution;
 (b) there has been a violation of the principles of natural justice;
 (c) the order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction; or
 (d) the vires of a legislation is challenged;"
 The Court found that the case of the Petitioners fell under Exception (b). Citing blatant violation of the principles of natural justice and the failure to adhere to the provisions of Section 8 of the Act, the Court set aside the impugned order.

The Supreme Court has observed that the procedure of 'oral direction' not to arrest an accused is irregular.
The court observed that the text of a written order is what is binding and enforceable and such oral directions can cause serious misgivings.
"Absent a written record of what has transpired in the course of a judicial proceeding, it would set a dangerous precedent if the parties and the investigating officer were expected to rely on unrecorded oral observations.", the bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah observed.
In this case, the accused had approached the Gujarat High Court by filing a petition under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code seeking quashing of FIR lodged against him Sections 405, 420, 465, 467, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code. When this petition was pending, the accused was arrested. When the proceedings were taken up after this arrest, the Court noted that, an oral direction was issued by the Court restraining the arrest, and thus the judge directed that the accused should forthwith be released.
In appeal, the court noted that the text of the order of the High Court did not contain any direction restraining the arrest of the accused.  Further it noted that only reasons for passing the impugned order are (i) Proceedings are pending between the parties; and (ii) Both of them have set the criminal machinery in action. 
The court said that if the High Court thought it fit to grant an interim protection against arrest, a specific judicial order to that effect was necessary. 
"Oral observations in court are in the course of a judicial discourse. The text of a written order is what is binding and enforceable. Issuing oral directions (presumably to the APP) restraining arrest, does not form a part of the judicial record and must be eschewed. Absent a judicial order, the investigating officer would have no official record emanating from the High Court on the basis of which a stay of arrest is enforced. The administration of criminal justice is not a private matter between the complainant and the accused but implicates wider interests of the State in preserving law and order as well as a societal interest in the sanctity of the criminal justice administration.", the court added.
The court said that, unlike civil cases involve disputes between two private contestants, criminal proceedings, apart from the accused and the complainant, there is a vital interest of the State and of society in the prosecution of crime. 
Procedure of issuing oral directions to not to arrest must be avoided
The Supreme Court said that High Courts should eschew the practice of issuing oral directions to not to arrest. 
"The procedure followed by the High Court of issuing an oral direction restraining the arrest of the first respondent was irregular",  the Court stated.
It added :
"The procedure which was followed by the Single Judge must therefore be eschewed in the future. Judges speak through their judgments and orders. The written text is capable of being assailed. The element of judicial accountability is lost where oral regimes prevail. This would set a dangerous precedent and is unacceptable. Judges, as much as public officials over whose conduct they preside, are accountable for their actions", it said.
Element of judicial accountability is lost where oral regimes prevail
"The element of judicial accountability is lost where oral regimes prevail. This would set a dangerous precedent and is unacceptable. Judges, as much as public officials over whose conduct they preside, are accountable for their actions".
Such a procedure is open to grave abuse, would set a dangerous precedent
"Oral directions of this nature by the High Court are liable to cause serious misgivings. Such a procedure is open to grave abuse. Most High Courts deal with high volumes of cases. Judicial assessments change with the roster. Absent a written record of what has transpired in the course of a judicial proceeding, it would set a dangerous precedent if the parties and the investigating officer were expected to rely on unrecorded oral observations"
Referring to Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra, the bench observed that the reasons recorded by the Court while issuing an interim order must reflect an application of mind to relevant facts and circumstances. 
Allowing the appeal, the bench said: "While an order granting a stay of arrest in a proceeding under Section 482 of the CrPC lies within the jurisdiction of the High Court, the grant of such relief must be after a judicious application of mind, which must emerge from the reasons which are recorded by the Judge. The formulation of reasons in a judicial order provides the backbone of public confidence in the sanctity of the judicial process. While directing that the proceedings are to be listed on a future date, the High Court is undoubtedly not expected to deliver a detailed judgment elaborating upon reasons why a stay of arrest has been granted. But the reasons recorded by the Court must reflect an application of mind to relevant facts and circumstances, including: (i) The nature and gravity of the allegations; (ii) The seriousness of the alleged offence(s); (iii) The position of the accused and the likelihood of their availability for investigation; and (iv) The basis on which a stay of arrest has been granted till the next date."

The Supreme Court imposed 10 Lakhs costs on applicants for attempting to seek review of a judgment under the garb of miscellaneous applications. In this case, a Miscellanious Application was filed seeking clarification of a judgment. The applicant contended that the court had not dealt with the aspect of security of pledge of shares with EARC having been arbitrarily and illegally wiped out in the Resolution Plan and invocation/non­invocation of pledge of shares by EARC. On perusing the applications, the bench of Justices BR Gavai and PS Narasimha observed that they are an attempt to seek review of the judgment and order under the garb of miscellaneous application. "We find that there is a growing tendency of indirectly seeking review of the orders of this Court by filing applications either seeking modification or clarification of the orders passed by this Court. In our view, such applications are a total abuse of process of law. The valuable time of Court is spent in deciding such applications which time would otherwise be utilized for attending litigations of the litigants who are waiting in the corridors of justice for decades together", the bench said. The court thus imposed costs of Rs.10,00,000/­ (Rupees ten lakhs) each on the applicants. In Ghanshyam Mishra vs EARC & Ors, the Supreme Court had held as follows:
Once a resolution plan is duly approved by the Adjudicating Authority under Section 31, the claims as provided in the resolution plan shall stand frozen and will be binding on the creditors (including statutory authorities, employees and guarantors)On the date of approval of resolution plan by the Adjudicating Authority, all such claims, which are not a part of resolution plan, shall stand extinguished and no person will be entitled to initiate or continue any proceedings in respect to a claim, which is not part of the resolution plan.The amendment made to section 31 of the IBC is clarificatory and declaratory in nature and therefore will be effective from the date on which I&B Code has come into effect.Consequently all the dues including the statutory dues owed to the Central Government, any State Government or any local authority, if not part of the resolution plan, shall stand extinguished and no proceedings in respect of such dues for the period prior to the date on which the Adjudicating Authority grants its approval under Section 31 could be continued.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Monday observed that Judges should refrain from making harsh or disparaging remarks against counsels, parties or witnesses, unless it is absolutely necessary for deciding the case and until they are heard.
The bench comprising Justice Mohan Lal remarked that Judges hold a "powerful seat" which must not be misused by indulging in intemperate comments, undignified banter or scathing criticism. "It is the general principle of highest importance to the proper administration of justice that derogatory remarks are not to be made against persons unless absolutely necessary for decision of the case to animadvert on their conduct."
The Court was hearing a petition filed under section 482 CrPC wherein the petitioner had prayed for expunging the adverse remarks, observations and directions made by Special NIA Judge, Jammu in the order impugned.
 The petitioner being a Deputy Superintendent of Police in J&K Police and investigation officer in two FIRs connected with the case before Special NIA Judge, was aggrieved by the observations made in the impugned order on the issue of framing of charge in those two matters. 
In his order, the Trial Court had proceeded to record his observation and dissatisfaction against the manner in which the IO, i.e., the petitioner had conducted the investigation. It had remarked that observed investigation was "perfunctory" and that the petitioner conducted himself in an "unprofessional manner", among other things.
The trial Court had further made personal remarks by casting aspersions on the selection of the Petitioner as a Deputy SP and had remarked that a much better investigation could have been conducted by even a "Head Constable".
 The trial court had went even more ahead in its order and directed IGP Jammu that a departmental enquiry should be initiated against the said police officer, where he should be asked that why and under what circumstances he had not collected the real evidence in the said cases and left over the important aspects of the case.
 Showing disapproval for such unwarranted observations by the trial court, Justice Mohan Lal observed that the limited controversy before the trial Court was to pass an order regarding the charge/discharge of the accused persons on the strength of the material collected by the investigating agency during investigation. 
It was of the view that the petitioner as IO of the case, in his best wisdom, had collected all the material/evidence during the investigation conducted by him and had placed all the relevant evidence before the trial Court in the form of charge sheet. Hence, it was the duty of the Trial Court to evaluate/assess the entire evidence on the record and to prima-facie come to conclusion whether accused persons can be prima-facie charged/discharged for commission of offences indicted against them in the charge sheet. It was not at all necessary for the trial Court to have passed/recorded such harsh/disparaging remarks against the petitioner (being I/O of the case) in its order and this too when the trial court had not even afforded opportunity of explaining or defending the petitioner himself, the bench noted. 
 The bench also found it worthwhile to record the observations of Supreme Court in A.M. Mathur, Appellant V/s Pramod Kumar Gupta, wherein Supreme court had observed,
 "Not only do judges have power to make binding decisions, their decisions legitimate the use of power by other officials. The Judges have the absolute and unchallengeable control of the Court domain. But they cannot misuse their authority by intemperate comments, undignified banter or scathing criticism of counsel, parties or witnesses".
 Allowing the petition and expunging the derogatory remarks against the petitioner, the bench called upon the courts below to observe sobriety, moderation and reserve as the duty of restraint is humility of function and should be a constant theme of our Judges. 
Higher the forum and greater the powers, the greater is the need for restraint and the more mellowed the reproach should be, the bench underscored.

The Supreme Court observed that prosecution of relatives of husband based on general and omnibus allegations levelled against them is an abuse of process of law.
The court also expressed its concern about increased tendency to employ provisions such as Section 498A IPC as instruments to settle personal scores against the husband and his relatives. The bench comprising Justices S. Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari said that a criminal trial leading to an eventual acquittal also inflicts severe scars upon the accused, and such an exercise must therefore be discouraged. General and omnibus allegations cannot manifest in a situation where the relatives of the complainant's husband are forced to undergo trial, the bench said.
In this case, the Husband and his relatives filed a criminal writ petition before the Patna High Court, for quashing of an FIR lodged by the wife, the complainant. As the High Court dismissed their petition, the relatives (in-laws) approached the Apex Court contending that the FIR in question has been made with a revengeful intent, merely to harass them. The 'wife' contended that the allegations made in the FIR are serious in nature and she has been repeatedly tortured physically and mentally in order to fulfil the demand for dowry. The issue considered was whether the allegations made against the in-laws Appellants are in the nature of general omnibus allegations and therefore liable to be quashed?
At the outset, the bench made the following observations on 'misuse' of Section 498A IPC:
"Incorporation of section 498A of IPC was aimed at preventing cruelty committed upon a woman by her husband and her in-laws, by facilitating rapid state intervention. However, it is equally true, that in recent times, matrimonial litigation in the country has also increased significantly and there is a greater disaffection and friction surrounding the institution of marriage, now, more than ever. This has resulted in an increased tendency to employ provisions such as 498A IPC as instruments to settle personal scores against the husband and his relatives."
Referring to observations made in earlier judgments viz. Rajesh Sharma and Ors. Vs. State of U.P (2018) 10 SCC 472, Arnesh Kumar Vs. State of Bihar and Anr (2014) 8 SCC 273, Preeti Gupta & Anr. Vs. State of Jharkhand & Anr (2010) 7 SCC 667, Geeta Mehrotra & Anr. Vs. State of UP & Anr.(2012) 10 SCC 741, K. Subba Rao v. The State of Telangana (2018) 14 SCC 452, the court said:
"18. The above-mentioned decisions clearly demonstrate that this court has at numerous instances expressed concern over the misuse of section 498A IPC and the increased tendency of implicating relatives of the husband in matrimonial disputes, without analysing the long term ramifications of a trial on the complainant as well as the accused. It is further manifest from the said judgments that false implication by way of general omnibus allegations made in the course of matrimonial dispute, if left unchecked would result in misuse of the process of law. Therefore, this court by way of its judgments has warned the courts from proceeding against the relatives and in-laws of the husband when no prima facie case is made out against them."
The court, perusing the FIR, noted that the complainant alleged that 'all accused harassed her mentally and threatened her of terminating her pregnancy'. But no specific and distinct allegations have been made against the accused in-laws.  The court, therefore, observed:
"This simply leads to a situation wherein one fails to ascertain the role played by each accused in furtherance of the offence. The allegations are therefore general and omnibus and can at best be said to have been made out on account of small skirmishes. Insofar as husband is concerned, since he has not appealed against the order of the High court, we have not examined the veracity of allegations made against him. However, as far as the Appellants are concerned, the allegations made against them being general and omnibus, do not warrant prosecution."
Thus, while allowing the appeal by quashing criminal proceedings against the appellants, the bench observed:
Therefore, upon consideration of the relevant circumstances and in the absence of any specific role attributed to the accused appellants, it would be unjust if the Appellants are forced to go through the tribulations of a trial, i.e., general and omnibus allegations cannot manifest in a situation where the relatives of the complainant's husband are forced to undergo trial. It has been highlighted by this court in varied instances, that a criminal trial leading to an eventual acquittal also inflicts severe scars upon the accused, and such an exercise must therefore be discouraged.
 

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently observed that the nature of service of a police official cannot be equated with the nature of any other service and a person who has been convicted of a criminal charge is definitely not fit to serve as police official/officer.
 The observations were made by Justice Sanjay Dhar while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had challenged an order passed by respondent UT of J&K, whereby the petitioner had been disengaged from the roll of Special Police Officers (SPOs) of the District Ramban.
 Apart from challenging the disengagement order the petitioner also prayed for a writ of mandamus seeking directions for his appointment as constable with retrospective effect with all consequential benefits. The petitioner further sought a writ of prohibition thereby asking the respondents not to take note of the judgment dated 6th June, 2018 passed by Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Gool.
 The petitioner challenged the order of disengagement mainly on the ground that in terms of Section 19 of the J&K Police Act, under which the petitioner was engaged as SPO, enjoys same powers, privileges and protection as are being enjoyed by ordinary officers of the police. On this ground, it was urged that without holding an enquiry and without issuing show cause notice to the petitioner, he could not have been discharged from service.
 Secondly the petitioner argued that because co-accused person with him were re-instated in their respective services, as such, he should also be re-instated.
 It was also brought to the notice of the Court that the Petitioner and co-accused were extended benefit of probation, upon conviction by the Magistrate.
 Adjudicating upon the matter, Justice Dhar observed that an SPO engaged under Section 18 of the J&K Police Act is not entitled to right of any hearing or enquiry, keeping in view the nature of his engagement and hence it was not incumbent upon the respondents to hold an enquiry or give an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner before terminating his services as SPO.
 In order to buttress the said position of law, the bench placed firm reliance on the Division bench judgement of J&K&L High Court in State of J&K v. Mohammad Iqal Mallah (LPA No.153 of 2012 decided on 05.06.2014).
 Dealing with the second contention of the petitioner the bench observed,
 "Even otherwise, once the petitioner was convicted of a criminal charge, even though, he was granted benefit of probation, it was open to the respondents to refuse to take him back in service, because the service of police department is not like service of any other department. A person, who has been convicted of a criminal charge is definitely not fit to serve as police official/officer not even as an SPO".
 Elaborating further Justice Dhar noted that the contention of the petitioner that just because co-accused after passing of the judgment by the criminal Court were re-instated in their respective services and as such, he should also be re-instated, cannot be accepted for the nature of service of a police official cannot be equated with the nature of any other service. Thus, there has been no discrimination against the petitioner, it underscored.
 Accordingly the bench found the petition without any merit and dismissed the same.
 Case Title : Bashir Ahmed Vs UT of J&K

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently directed the Govt of J&K to fix the seniority of Anganwadi workers from their initial engagement reiterating that the acquisition of higher qualification at a later date, even when such a higher qualification is the requisite qualification for the higher post, will not be determinative for fixing the seniority.
The ruling came to be pronounced by a bench comprising Justice Javed Iqbal Wani while hearing a catena of petitions filed by Anganwadi workers challenging the government order issued in February 2019 relating to the selection of Anganwadi Workers as Supervisors.
In their pleas the petitioners contended that the seniority of the Graduate Anganwari Workers was to be reckoned from the date of their initial appointment as provided under Rule 24 of J&K Civil Service (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules of 1956 [CCA Rules], however, as per the Clause-1 of the impugned order, the seniority of the Anganwari Workers, who have acquired higher qualification (Graduation) during service shall be taken from the date of acquiring the higher qualification instead of the date of their initial appointment.
The moot question that fell for adjudication before the bench was as to whether the seniority of a Graduate Anganwari Worker who acquires qualification of Graduation after engagement as Anganwari Worker is required to be fixed according to the date of initial engagement/appointment as Anganwari Worker as envisaged under Rule 24 of CCA Rules or from the date such Anganwari Worker acquires qualification of Graduation as is provided by the impugned Clause. 
The bench noted that in terms of Rules of 1991, the post of Anganwari Workers is identified as one class under Clause-III and does not make any distinction on the basis of educational qualification as such.
Keeping in view the said position, Justice Wani maintained that a common seniority list of all Anganwari Workers, notwithstanding any disparity of qualification, is required to be maintained on the basis of the initial engagement and irrespective of the date on which any Anganwari Worker acquires Graduate qualification. Undertaking any process of maintaining a separate seniority for both Graduates and Matriculate Anganwari Workers on the basis of acquiring higher qualification would be contrary to the Rules, the bench underscored.
Observing that the formulation of principles for fixation of seniority, promotion and determination of seniority are matters of policy which may find expression either in statutory rules or administrative orders including executive instructions, the court ruled that when a particular field is occupied by statutory rules then the administrative orders or executive instructions cannot be issued to nullify the effect or impact of the statutory rules.
Deliberating on the issue of the conflict between a statutory rule and an administrator order, the bench explained that the statutory rule has to prevail and the administrative order/executive instruction has to give way to the statutory rule if both occupy the same field.
Applying the said position to the instant matter the court said that since the statutory rules of 1991 occupy the field insofar as determination and fixation of seniority of Anganwari Workers the impugned Clause under challenge pales into insignificance and the same cannot therefore sustain as being contrary to the mandate of said rules.
In order to buttress the course adopted the bench placed reliance on a Supreme court judgment in a case titled Viman Vaman Awale Vs. Gangadhar Makhriya Charitable Trust and others wherein the court recorded that the acquisition of higher qualification at a later date, even when such a higher qualification is the requisite qualification for the higher post, will not be determinative for fixing the seniority.
"However for the purpose of computing the experience with a particular qualification, the relevant date would be when relevant qualification has been acquired. Previous experience without particular qualification will have to be ignored," it clarified.
Accordingly the bench held that the clause incorporated in the impugned government order is contrary to the Rules of 1991 read with Rule 24 of CCA Rules of 1956 and thus not in conformity with law on the principle laid down by the Apex Court in the aforementioned judgment and quashed the same.

 Case Title: Rubina @ Rubi Anwarhusen Sunni (Muslim) Versus State Of Gujarat
 Case No.: R/CR.MA/1274/2022

A Full Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday held that proceedings under Section 12 of the Domestic Violence Act can be challenged in the High Court only under Article 227 of the Constitution and not by invoking the court's power under Section 482 CrPC.
The matter was referred to the bench of Justice PN Prakash, Justice RMT Teeka Raman and Justice AD Jagadish Chandira after Justice N Satish Kumar, while considering a batch of petitions seeking to quash the application filed under Section 12 of the DV Act by invoking the provision under Section 482 CrPC, in an order observed that a division bench's recent ruling on the legal question was not in consonance with the Supreme Court decisions. 
A division bench of the court which ruled that proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act are civil in nature had also observed that Section 482 CrPC petition is maintainable in Domestic Violence Act proceedings. However, according to the single judge, the decision was not in consonance with the decisions of the Supreme Court and thus, he referred the matter to a larger bench to answer the following questions:
Whether a proceeding under Section 12 of the D.V.Act can be challenged under Article 227 of the Constitution or under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.? Whether the aforesaid remedy is available to an aggrieved person before approaching the learned Magistrate and, if necessary, the Court of Sessions by way of an appeal under Section 29 of the D.V.Act?
While disposing of the petition, the larger bench observed that the High Court did not have the powers to quash proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act through Section 482 of CrPC. It observed that this is because, under the Domestic Violence Act, a Magistrate court is the designated court to hear applications. Since Magistrate's court is not a criminal court, a petition under Section 482 is not maintainable. The High Court could thus entertain challenges against proceedings under Domestic Violence Act only under Article 227.
The court thus upheld the decision of a single bench of the Madras High Court in Dr.P.Pathamnathan v. V.Monica to hold that proceedings under the DV Act are civil in nature. 
In the above case, Justice N. Anand Venkatesh looked into the Statement of Objects of the Domestic Violence Act which spells out that the Act has been enacted mainly to address the absence of civil law remedies to the victims of an offence under Section 498-A IPC and also to provide a remedy under civil law to protect the women from being a victim of Domestic Violence and to prevent such occurrences.
The full bench also observed that proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act could not be transferred to the Family Courts since these courts only had additional jurisdiction to deal with such matters. The court added that an aggrieved person could file an appeal in the Sessions Court and then approach the High Court in further appeal under Article 227 but not under Section 482 of CrPC.
The full court further clarified that the order shall be applicable only prospectively. Therefore, those cases where the matter was already transferred to the Family Court need not be interfered with at this point by way of the High Court order, it added.
"What has already happened, let it be. Why should we open a Pandora's Box. Since these disputes are matrimonial in nature, it will further prolong the agony of the parties if it is transferred from one court to another," the court observed.

The Bombay High Court recently allowed the termination of a 16 weeks' pregnancy of a minor who was a victim of sexual abuse and was also in custody at an Observation Home for a crime of murder under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
 A bench of Justices A.S. Chandurkar and Urmila Joshi-Phalke noted that the Apex Court has observed that reproductive choice is an insegragable part of a woman's personal liberty as envisaged under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
"She cannot be forced to give birth to a child...She has a choice to give birth to the child or not," it observed.
The petitioner was a minor who had committed murder and was in custody at an Observation Home. It was discovered by the Investigating Officer that she was pregnant because of sexual abuse. A crime under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 was registered.
 The petitioner pleaded that she is from an economically weak background, and has also undergone trauma due to sexual abuse, which she continues to suffer from. She pleaded that given her circumstances it would be difficult for her to raise a child. Neither was she equipped financially nor mentally. Moreover, this was an unwanted pregnancy.
 The bench called for a Medical Report, which stated that her pregnancy was 16 weeks, yet it consented for termination of her pregnancy. The bench noted that Section 3 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 provides for termination of pregnancy:
 when the length of the pregnancy does not exceed twelve weeksWhen the length of the pregnancy exceeds twelve weeks, if more than two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion that the termination is in good faith If the continuance of the pregnancy would involve a grave risk to the life or mental health of the pregnant woman If there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from serious physical or mental abnormalities 
 Explanation 1 further allows termination if the pregnancy is caused by rape as the anguish caused by such pregnancy shall constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman.
 The High Court held that termination of pregnancy can be permitted post twelve weeks in certain situations. The bench noted that in the present case the petitioner is a minor and is unmarried. She is a victim of sexual abuse. Moreover, she is lodged in an Observational Home for an offence of murder. She is from an impoverished background. She also contends that the pregnancy is unwanted, and she is suffering from severe trauma.
 The bench stated that declining permission to terminate the pregnancy would be tantamount to compelling her to continue with her pregnancy which in the circumstances will not only be a burden on her, but it would also cause grave injury to her mental health. Considering these observations, the court allowed the termination of the petitioner's pregnancy regardless of her having completed sixteen weeks.
 Case Title: 'A'  versus  State of Maharashtra and Anr.

The Rajasthan High Court has observed that any interference in rejection of grant of fresh application / renewal of license for firearms is not warranted except when extraordinary circumstances are pointed out by the party. In this regard, the court pursued Section 17 of the Arms Act, 1959 which talks about variation, suspension and revocation of licences.
The present petitioner had raised grievance regarding the arms license.
The court directed the petitioner to file a fresh representation within a period of 15 days and asked the respective District Magistrate to consider the representation afresh by passing speaking orders, while keeping in mind the existing policy of the State.
Justice Vijay Bishnoi, observed,
"This Court is of the opinion that any interference in rejection of grant of fresh application/ refusal/ renewal of license for firearms is not warranted except when extraordinary circumstances are pointed out. Looking into the submission made by learned counsel for the parties that it would be suffice if their rights are redetermined by the respondents, while keeping into consideration the judgment rendered in Khem Singh (supra), the same is accepted."
In Khem Singh v. State of Rajasthan, the High Court had said that mere fact that some reports have been lodged against the license holder is not sufficient for cancelling the license. The court had added that a license can be revoked u/s.17 (3) of the Arms Act, if the licensing authority deem it necessary for the security of public peace or public safety. The court had also noted that in absence of any finding that cancellation was necessary for public peace or public safety, such an order is liable to be quashed.
The petitioner was aggrieved by inaction and unjustified delay in issuance of arms license/ no opportunity of hearing given. It was submitted that though a case was pending against him, the same pertained to gambling and thereby did not impact public safety.
Further, the petitioner's counsel submitted that there is a statutory provision for persons to apply and acquire a firearm license, and thus, the respondents ought to maintain maximum transparency, while passing the orders, whereas the impugned orders have been passed without making any individual consideration of the relevant criteria.
The counsel for the respondents submits that there is no absolute right of any person to acquire an arms license and the respondents have every right to objectively decide each case, while taking into consideration the past record of the person seeking such license as well as the pendency of proceedings, if any.
Adv. Lakshya Singh Udawat appeared for the petitioner while Dy. G.C. Ramdayal Choudhary and Adv. Ramdayal Choudhary appeared for the respondents.
Case Title: Bhan Singh v. State Of Rajasthan & Ors.
  (Raj) 195

The Delhi Police has informed the High Court that it is carrying out periodic checks throughout the national capital to ensure that no barricade remains unmanned and that it will make all possible endeavours to keep all the barricades manned.
Taking noting of the submission, a division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad disposed of a suo moto public interest litigation registered by the court last year in respect of the unmanned barricades 
A status report was filed by the Delhi Police on January 6 stating that disciplinary action was initiated in 51 cases against concerned staff or SHOs for violating standing order issued in March 2022. 
It added that barricades are being put up at 773 locations, out of which 714 are manned by the police staff and barricades in remaining 59 locations or colonies are being manned by the RWA staff. 
“The Night Checking Officers also check all the barricades placed in the area and if any unmanned barricade is found, information is required to be immediately forwarded to the District Control Room and also to the concerned SHO. The night patrolling staff has also been directed to inform the SHOs about it so that the unmanned barricades are immediately removed,” the report states. 
An assurance was given by DCP South East District regarding strict compliance of the Standing Order issued by the Delhi Police Headquarters and a circular dated September 15, 2022 issued by the Commissioner of Police. 
“In light of the aforesaid, no further orders are required to be passed in the matter. The petition is disposed of, along with pending application(s), if any,” the court said.
A previous status report filed in the matter under the signatures of DCP Legal stated that a detailed standing order was revised, wherein it was instructed that under no circumstances the barricades should be left unmanned.
The order stated that barricades should be removed from the carriageway and footpath when not in use so that they don't cause any traffic hindrance or become a cause of potential hazard for motorists and pedestrians.
Delhi Police had previously also taken the court through to a letter dated March 4, 2022 stating that the staff has been sensitized for ensuring meticulous compliance of directions contained in the standing order.
The Police in September last year informed the court that the complaints relating to unattended barricades can be immediately reported on 112 helpline or Twitter by tagging social media handles of the traffic police.
The matter was registered last year as a PIL on the basis of a letter addressed by one On Prakash Goel. In the letter, which was also addressed to the Prime Minister, grievances were raised with respect to setting up of unmanned barricades in the areas in question.
Om Prakash had argued that such unmanned barricades serve no purpose and are in fact causing blockades of free flow of traffic, resulting in misery and harassment to vehicle owners and general public.
Case Title: COURT ON ITS OWN MOTION V. THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE AND ORS

While upholding the detention of an alleged worker of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), under the J&K Public Safety Act, 1978, the Jammu & Kashmir And Ladakh High Court last week observed that those who are responsible for national security or for maintenance of public order must be the sole judges of what the national security, public order or security of the State requires.Observing that it...
While upholding the detention of an alleged worker of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), under the J&K Public Safety Act, 1978, the Jammu & Kashmir And Ladakh High Court last week observed that those who are responsible for national security or for maintenance of public order must be the sole judges of what the national security, public order or security of the State requires.
Observing that it is necessary to take preventive measures and prevent a person bent upon perpetrating mischief from translating his ideas into action, the Bench of Justice Tashi Rabstan stressed that preventive detention laws are devised to afford protection to society.
Further, noting that the basis of detention is the satisfaction of the executive of a reasonable probability of likelihood of detenu acting in a manner similar to his past acts and preventing him by detention from doing the same, the court significantly observed thus:
"There is no reason why the Executive cannot take recourse to its power of preventive detention in those cases where the Court is genuinely satisfied that no prosecution could possibly succeed against detenu because he is a dangerous person who has overawed witnesses or against whom no one is prepared to depose," the Court further remarked.
The Court also stressed that the acts or activities of individual or a group of individuals, prejudicial to the security of the State or public order, have the magnitude of across-the board disfigurement of societies and therefore, no court should tune out such activities, being swayed by the passion of mercy. 
"It is an obligation of the Court to constantly remind itself the right of society is never maltreated or marginalized by doings, an individual or set of individuals propagate and carry out...The court do not even go into the questions whether the facts mentioned in the grounds of detention are correct or false. The reason for the rule is that to decide this, evidence may have to be taken by the courts and that it is not the policy of the law of preventive detention. This matter lies within the competence of the advisory board," the Court added.
Regarding, the Court's power to examine the material, which is made the basis of subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority, the Court opined that it would not act as a court of appeal and find fault with the satisfaction on the ground that on the basis of the material before detaining authority another view was possible.
Importantly, referring to Ashok Kumar v. Delhi Administration and others AIR 1982 SC 1143, the Court said that any preventive measures, even if they involve some restraint or hardship upon individuals, do not partake in any way of the nature of punishment.
Further, the Court also noted that where individual liberty comes into conflict with an interest of the security of the State or maintenance of public order, then the liberty of the individual must give way to the larger interest of the nation.
Lastly, opining that the petition was shorn of any merit, the Court, while dismissing the plea filed by Muntazir Ahmad Bhat, an alleged worker of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), observed that Preventive detention is devised to afford protection to society and the object is not to punish a man for having done something but to intercept before he does it, and to prevent him from doing so.

The Supreme Court observed that the Labour Court cannot overturn the decision of the management on "ipse dixit" and its decision should not be based on mere hypothesis. Observing that the Labour Court converted itself into a "Court of Appeal", the Supreme Court set aside the Labour Court's decision which overturned the management's decision to terminate the services of an employee.
A Division Bench comprising Justice Ajay Rastogi and Justice Abhay S Oka observed that a Labour Court's jurisdiction under Section 11­A of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 must be judiciously exercised, and cannot be exercised either whimsically or capriciously. While the Tribunal may scrutinize or analyse the evidence, what is important is how is it done(Case: Standard Chartered Bank Vs RC Srivastava). 
Section 11 A of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 deals with the powers of Labour Courts, Tribunals and National Tribunals to give appropriate relief in in case of discharge or dismissal of workmen.
The observations have been made in the context of Tribunal's order reinstating a Bank employee while reversing the order of his termination passed after a disciplinary enquiry.
The Bench has observed that the Tribunal completely overlooked and exceeded its jurisdiction while interfering with the finding recorded during the course of disciplinary enquiry in furtherance of which, the respondent employee was dismissed from service.
Further, the High Court has also committed a manifest error while passing the impugned judgment and upholding the Tribunal's order of reinstatement.
The Bench has found that the Tribunal converted itself into a Court of Appeal as an appellate authority and exceeded its jurisdiction while appreciating the finding recorded in the course of domestic enquiry.
According to the Court, the Tribunal tested the domestic inquiry on the broad principles of charge to be proved beyond reasonable doubt which is a test in the criminal justice system, and completely forgot the fact that the domestic enquiry is to be tested on the principles of preponderance of probabilities.
" If a piece of evidence is on record which could support the charge which has been levelled against the delinquent unless it is per se unsustainable or perverse, ordinarily is not to be interfered by the Tribunal, more so when the domestic enquiry has been held to be fair and proper" the Bench said.
"The decision of the Labour Court should not be based on mere hypothesis. It cannot overturn the decision of the management on ipse dixit. Its jurisdiction under Section 11­A of the Act 1947 although is a wide one but it must be judiciously exercised. Judicial discretion, it is trite, cannot be exercised either whimsically or capriciously. It may scrutinize or analyse the evidence but what is important is how it does so", the Court observed.
The Bench has made the observations while delivering its judgement in an appeal filed against Allahabad High Court's order dated 21st November, 2014 whereby it upheld the reinstatement of an employee of Standard Chartered Bank with full back wages awarded by the Tribunal in 2006.
In the present case, a charge­sheet dated 27th January, 1988 was served upon the respondent­ employee for the alleged delinquency which he had committed on 12th January, 1988 in discharge of his duties, with the allegation of
Drunkenness within the premises of the BankManhandling and assaulting the senior officersHurling abuses at the management
A departmental enquiry was held in terms of the Bipartite Settlement and after due compliance of the principles of natural justice the Enquiry Officer had held the charges proved against the employee. The disciplinary authority also confirmed the Enquiry Officer's finding and punished him with the penalty of dismissal from service by an order dated 22nd August, 1991.
The Tribunal however reversed the order, directing reinstatement of the employee in service with full back wages, seniority and all the consequential benefits finding that the Bank's management had miserably failed to establish the charges levelled against him and held the charges not being proved
The Tribunal's order was challenged by the Bank before the High Court, but the same was dismissed.
Supreme Court through its order dated 29th September 2021 has held that the Award passed by the Tribunal and confirmed by the High Court under impugned judgment is not sustainable in law.
The Top Court has allowed the Bank's appeal against High Court's judgment affirming Tribunal's order of reinstatement of the employee, with the clarification that there will be no recovery in reference to the payment which has been made over to the respondent­ workman in the interregnum period.
Case Title: Standard Chartered Bank Vs RC Srivastava (Civil Appeal 6092 of 2021)

The Karnataka High Court has said that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) can investigate the complaint registered by a bank against a company and its directors, alleging offences of cheating, criminal conspiracy, even after initiation of proceedings under the SARFAESI Act and possession of the recovery certificate.
"This Court again in plethora of cases has clearly held that when the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is invoked by the Bank, unless such an action is declared to be a fraud, they cannot maintain two proceedings – one before the Debt Recovery Tribunal and the other setting the criminal law in motion. If the account is declared to be a fraud and the account holders to be wilful defaulters, then it would become open to initiate such proceedings in terms of the Master Circular," said the court.
It added, "Therefore, having initiated recovery proceedings before the Debt Recovery Tribunal and having a recovery certificate in their hand would not mean that the proceedings cannot be initiated against these petitioners..."
Associate Lumbers Private Limited and its Directors had challenged the FIR registered by the CBI under provisions of PC Act and Section 120B read with Section 420 IPC on the basis of a complaint filed by the bank. While the company could not pay its debt in time and was proceeded against under the SARFAESI Act, the bank also declared the company's account fraud and account holders to be wilful defaulters. In February 2022, the matter was referred to the CBI.
A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna, while dismissing the petition against CBI FIR, said:
 "Clause 8.1 (Of the master circular issued by RBI) mandates that the amount involved in the fraud, if it is more than Rs.25.00 crores and up to Rs.50.00 crores, the Bank would complain to the Banking Security and Fraud Cell of the CBI "irrespective of the involvement of a public servant. Therefore, there can be no submission that the CBI cannot be complained of in a Bank fraud which does not involve any public servant."
 It added, "The Master Circular mandates that the Bank shall complain to the CBI if the amount involved is between Rs.25.00 crores to Rs.50.00 crores. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the CBI is amount specific, as depicted in the Master Circular and it cannot be said that the CBI does not get any jurisdiction to entertain complaints where there are no public servants."
The bench also noted that Apex Court has considered the purport of the circular issued by the RBI and held that they have statutory flavour as they are guidelines and administrative instructions issued in terms of the Banking Regulation Act.
 Relying on the judgement of the Apex court in the case of CENTRAL BANK OF INDIA v. RAVINDRA AND OTHERS the bench said, "The Five Judge Bench of the Apex Court clearly holds that the guidelines/directives issued by the RBI, to have a statutory flavour. If it is held by the Apex Court that those guidelines have statutory flavour, the contention of the learned senior counsel that the CBI would not get jurisdiction unless it is conferred by the statute tumbles down. The CBI does have jurisdiction in terms of what is depicted in the Master Circulars and such Master Circulars are held to have a statutory flavour."
 As regards the contention of the petitioners that these offences cannot be looked into as there is no public servant involved in the case at hand, the bench referred to Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 under which the Central Bureau of Investigation takes its genesis. 
It then said, "The Government of India in terms of Section 3 has issued notification which forms part of the CBI Manual as to what are the offences that can be investigated into by the CBI which forms part of the Indian Penal Code. Both Sections 420 and 120B of the IPC, form a part of the said notification. Therefore, the contention that the CBI would not get jurisdiction to enquire into any offence other than the offences under the Act is again rendered unacceptable."
 It added, "The matter is still at the stage of investigation. The CBI is investigating the matter and not yet filed its final report. It is too early in the day for the petitioners to contend that no Bank official being named as accused, the offence under the Act is unnecessarily made, only to empower the CBI to conduct investigation are all contentions that cannot be countenanced at this stage."
 The matter requires to be investigated into on every aspect – role of public servants and also the role of the petitioners, "as it is prima facie brought out in the complaint against the petitioners and giving up of the staff qua their accountability is also, prima facie, is a matter to be investigated into", said the court.
The bench also said it is too premature for the Court to interfere in the allegations of the nature that is made in the case at hand.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently directed the trial court to issue direction against the Prosecutrix in a rape case to refund the compensation she had received from the State Government because she had admitted in her statement that she had lodged a false report against the accused.
 Deciding the bail application moved by the Applicant/accused, Justice Vivek Agarwal observed-
 Trial court will consider issuance of a direction against the prosecutrix to refund the amount received by her because she admitted in her examination in chief that she has lodged false report on account of some oral dispute between the parties. Therefore, alleged false report is lodged, therefore she is not entitled to keep the amount of compensation paid by the State government collected from the tax payer of the country. Thus, trial court will consider to direct the prosecutrix to refund that amount in the appropriate head of the treasury account.
 The facts of the case were that the Applicant was accused for offences punishable under Section 376, 376(2)(N), 506 IPC, U/S 3, 4, 5J(ii), 5L POCSO Act and under Section 3(1)(w)(II), 3(1)(w)(II), 3(II)(V) of SC/ST Act.
 The Applicant submitted before the Court that the Prosecutrix had turned hostile before the trial court and was not supporting the prosecution story. He further pointed out that even her grandmother and her uncle had turned hostile. He asserted that there was no chance of Prosecutrix being influenced and that all the other material witnesses had been examined. He prayed that since his trial would take time to conclude, he be enlarged on bail.
 Considering the facts of the case and documents on record the Court, the Court thought it to be a fit case for grant of bail-
 Taking into consideration submissions of learned counsel for the parties and the fact that prosecutrix is already examined, she has not supported the prosecution story and applicant is in custody since 03/11/2021. Hence without commenting anything on merits of the case, this bail application is allowed.
 With the aforesaid observations, the Court allowed the application and accordingly, the Applicant was granted bail.

In a groundbreaking judgment, the Kerala High Court has declared as unconstitutional the bar on lawyers representing parties in matters before the Maintenance Tribunals constituted under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 (Maintenance Act).
 A Bench of Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly pronounced judgment in the case last week, allowing a writ petition filed in 2011.
 Drawing from Section 30 of the Advocates Act, the Bench ruled,
 "By virtue of Section 30 of the Advocates Act, 1961, coming into force from 15.06.2011, the restriction imposed is taken away and in such circumstances, Article 19 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees the freedom to practice any profession, enables the Advocates to appear before all the Courts and the Tribunals, subject to Section 34 of the Advocates Act, 1961."
 The provision(Section 30 of Advocates Act), which was notified in 2011, entitles an Advocate as of right to practise before all Courts, tribunals and persons authorised to take evidence and before any other authority or person.
 The petitioner, one Advocate KG Suresh of Pathanamthitta, instituted Public Interest Litigation in the year 2011 seeking a declaration that Section 17 was unconstitutional in light of the then-newly introduced section 30 of the Advocates Act.
 Upon consideration of submissions, the Court held that Section 30, being introduced and notified in 2011, had an overriding effect on Section 17 of the Maintenance Act.
 "Therefore, the latter enactment has an overriding effect on Section 17 of the 2007 Act", the Bench ruled.
 Accepting the submissions advanced by the petitioner's counsel Advocates V Sethunath, VR Manoranjan, Prakash Kesavan and V Vinay, as well as the Bar Council, the Court pointed out that parties to a lis before the Maintenance Tribunal would not be expected to know the nuances of the evidence that was to be produced before the Tribunal.
 In this light, allowing legal advice alone would not suffice, the Court effectively held.
 Connecting the same the right to legal aid, the Court underscored that legal assistance in maintenance matters "cannot be confined only to legal advice, which, in our view, would not be sufficient, in the interest of the parties."
 It was stated in this respect,
 "Legal aid is a constitutional right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and legal assistance cannot be confined only to legal advice, which, in our view, would not be sufficient, in the interest of the parties."
 Rejecting the contention that the engagement of lawyers would jeopardise the objective of the legislation to provide a speedy and cost effective mechanism to parents and senior citizens, the Court stated,
 "..mere engagement of a lawyer would not delay the process of adjudication of a dispute before the Maintenance Tribunal."
 On the question of whether engaging a lawyer would hamper the cost effectiveness envisaged by the legislation, the Court underscored that this could not be countenanced either because the Legal Services Authority, constituted under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, would come to the aid of such litigant, by engaging a lawyer to assist him.
 The Bench addressed the Union of India on this submission in this way
 "…Union of India, cannot undermine the role of the Legal Services Authority, and the lawyers engaged by them, to assist the litigants, in comparison to the lawyers to be engaged by the children/ grandchildren/ relatives, solely on the ground that they are financially in a better position to avail the services of the best advocates."
 Further submissions that the Maintenance Act sought that disputes and differences be resolved amicably and that the Tribunal would nominate Conciliation officers for this purpose was also rejected. 
 "He (the Conciliation Officer) will not be a substitute for a lawyer", the Court opined.
 The argument that the "engagement of legal practitioners to represent cases will prolong the matter and will be more of a harassment for the parents in their last phase of life as judgment will be delayed, is wholly unacceptable", the bench additionally remarks in its judgment.
 In view of the above, the Court pronounced Section 17 of the Maintenance Act, concluding
 "As Section 30 of the Advocates Act, 1961 has been brought into force from 15.06.2011, Advocates enrolled under the said Act have been conferred with an absolute right thereof, to practice before all the Courts and Tribunals…In the light of the above discussion and decisions, Section 17 of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, is declared as ultra vires of Section 30 of the Advocates Act, 1961 and thus, the petitioner is entitled for a declaration that he has a right to represent the parties before the Tribunal/Appellate Tribunal/Court, constituted under Act 56 of 2007."
 With a declaration that the petitioner be allowed to practise in maintenance tribunals/other for a under the Maintenance Act, 2007, the petition was allowed.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that duration of marriage is not a ground to discard the willingness of one of the spouse, to donate kidney in favour of other spouse, particularly when the case has been verified on all legal parameters.
The observation was made while dealing with a writ petition for the issuance of an appropriate writ in the nature of mandamus directing the respondent to conduct surgery of renal transplant of the petitioner's husband by receiving the organ from the petitioner-wife without further delay.
 The bench comprising Justice Raj Mohan Singh stated that the duration of marriage is not a ground to discard the willingness of the petitioner to donate her kidney for saving the life of her husband.
 The case came up as a result of the authorization committee's rejection of allowing kidney transplantation of the petitioner's husband by receiving the organ from the petitioner herself. The petitioner-wife has gone through all the medical tests suggested by respondent No.2 including verification of her physical as well as mental state of health. In all the tests, it has been found by respondent No.2 that she is fit enough to donate her kidney to save her husband's life. Her husband's life is in a serious condition. Petitioner's case that was placed before a competent authority constituted by Respondent No.2-Hospital for authorization of kidney transplantation has been rejected on the ground of the short duration of the marriage between the petitioner and the recipient.
 After considering the submissions, the court stated that the identity and consent of the petitioner as required have already been verified by the respondents.
 Admittedly condition of husband of the petitioner is very serious, who is already on dialysis on day to day basis since long. The identity and consent of the petitioner as required under rule 22 of the Transplantation of Human Organs Rules, 2014 have already been verified by the respondents. No other consent of any parents or siblings of donor is required….
 Court further noted that there is no greed involved in this case nor is there any kind of pressure exerted upon the petitioner to donate her kidney and the same has been verified by the police. The petitioner is the legally wedded wife of the recipient. There are various statutory provisions that have been promulgated to prevent trafficking and commercial practices but there is nothing on record to show any malpractice, greed, or pressure in the instant case.
 The statutory provisions have been promulgated to prevent trafficking and commercial practices. Every care/caution has to be taken to prevent exploitation of any kind. Petitioner is legally wedded wife of the recipient. There is no material on record to indicate any malpractice or any element of greed or pressure being exerted upon the petitioner. The condition of husband of the petitioner is very serious.
 While stating that the petitioner and her husband are not foreign nationals, the court held that there is no legal bar attached to the petitioner for donating one of the kidneys to her husband. As far as the authorization committee's rejection of the case is concerned, the court held that it was done on the basis of the short duration of marriage between the petitioner and the recipient but the same is not a ground to discard the willingness of one of the spouses to donate a kidney to the other.
 Admittedly, petitioner and her husband are not foreign nationals. The authorization committee has only rejected the case of the petitioner for kidney transplantation due to short duration of marriage. Evidently, the duration of marriage is not a ground to discard the willingness of one of the spouse, to donate kidney in favour of other spouse, particularly when the case of the petitioner has been verified on all legal parameters. Marriage has already been registered with the Marriage Registrar and a marriage certificate has been duly issued in favour of the couple.
 For the reasons discussed above and keeping in view the facts and circumstances, the competent authority is directed to conclusively decide the application and allow transplantation of the same at the earliest.
Case Title : Manpreet Kaur v. State Of Punjab And Ors.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that default bail to an accused charged under NDPS Act cannot be denied on the pretext of investigation not being complete within the stipulated period of 180 days, unless the Public Prosecutor, after he has independently applied his mind, files a report disclosing justification for keeping the accused in further custody to enable the...
The Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that default bail to an accused charged under NDPS Act cannot be denied on the pretext of investigation not being complete within the stipulated period of 180 days, unless the Public Prosecutor, after he has independently applied his mind, files a report disclosing justification for keeping the accused in further custody to enable the investigating agency to complete the investigation.
Justice Sant Prakash observed that a Public Prosecutor is not merely a post office or a forwarding agency.
"For seeking extension of time, the Public Prosecutor after an independent application of mind to the request of the investigating agency, is required to make a report to the court indicating therein the progress of the investigation and disclosing justification for keeping the accused in further custody to enable the investigating agency to complete the investigation. The Public Prosecutor may attach the request of the investigating officer alongwith his request on application and report, but his report must disclose on the face of it, that he has applied his mind and was satisfied with the progress of the investigation and considered grant of further time to complete the investigation," the bench observed.
The development ensued in a criminal revision petition filed against the trial court's order dismissing petitioner's application for default bail under S.167(2) of CrPC read with S.36A(4) of NDPS Act citing prosecution's demand for extension of time beyond the 180 days given, for filing challan. 
At the outset, the Court observed that under the proviso to Section 36A(4) of the NDPS Act, the Court may extend the 180 days prescribed period for completing the investigation to one year. However, the same may be done on the report of the Public Prosecutor indicating the progress of the investigation and the specific reasons for the detention of the accused beyond the said period of one hundred and eighty days.
In this backdrop, the Court was of the opinion that "merely filing of an application in this regard does not ipso facto empower the court to extend the stipulated period for filing challan". The High Court further elaborated on the duties of Public Prosecutor and stated that a Public Prosecutor must independently apply his mind to a request by investigating agency seeking extension of time and then make a report to the court about the progress of the investigation and whether there is a necessity to keep the accused in further custody.
"The report of the Public Prosecutor, therefore, is not merely a formality but a very vital report because the consequence of its acceptance affects the liberty of an accused and it must, therefore, strictly comply with the requirements of Section 36A(4) of the NDPS Act. The contents of the report to be submitted by the Public Prosecutor, after proper application of his mind, are designed to assist the court to independently decide whether or not extension should be granted in a given case."
In the instant case, the petitioner-accused was charged with possession of commercial quantity contraband. His application for default bail was dismissed by the trial Court on the ground that the prosecution has sought for extension upto 1 year, as it had not received the FSL report.
Aggrieved, the petitioner came up with a criminal revision petition.
 Noting that in the case at hand, the Public prosecutor had barely appended his signatures without even endorsing that he had read the grounds or was satisfied with the investigation, the Court pointed out that "it's a settled proposition of law that report is not a mere formality but requires due application of mind as to the ground for the delay in filing challan and reasons for further detention of accused."
 Thus, the Court stated that the application filed by the prosecution neither met the requirements envisaged in S.36A(4) of the NDPS Act and neither did it reflect the steps taken for obtaining the FSL report during the initial 180 days.
 The Court also elaborated on the indefeasible right of an accused person under S.167(2) of CrPC, which accrues in cases of default by the investigating agency for its failure to complete an investigation within the maximum period prescribed. Stating that an order of release on bail under S.167(2), CrPC is called an "order-on-default" because it is "granted on account of the default of the prosecution to complete the investigation and file the challan within the prescribed period," the High Court noted that the petitioner's right to default bail under S.167(2), CrPC was violated here.
 Thus, the Court stated that not only the application for extension of time was allowed without any notice to the petitioner, but even specific reasons pertaining to the progress of investigation and detention of petitioner beyond 180 days also were not laid down in the order extending the time for completion of the investigation and thus, the trial court's order dismissing petitioner's bail application is bad in law and is set aside. 
The Court ordered that the petitioner to be released on default bail on furnishing requisite bonds.

The Delhi High Court has observed that a minor child is entitled to claim maintenance for his upbringing by the father and that such a child is not bound by the divorce settlement regarding maintenance between his parents. 
Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh was dealing with an appeal filed by a minor child being aggrieved by the grant of interim maintenance by the Family Court at Rs. 15,000 per month. 
The High Court had vide order dated April 22, 2021 enhanced the said maintenance amount and directed the father to pay Rs. 25,000 per month to the minor, considering that his school fee itself was in that range.
Observing that when the mother of the minor child obtained divorce by mutual consent, the maintenance was fixed in respect of the child at Rs. 5,000 per month, the Court said:
"It goes without saying that the appellant being a minor, is not bound by that settlement, and he is entitled to claim maintenance for himself for his upbringing from the respondent i.e., his father."
The appellant had contended that the father had not truly and correctly disclosed his income and that from his Income Tax Returns (ITRs) filed before the Court, it appeared that apart from agricultural income which was the only income claimed to have been earned by the father, he had been deriving rental income from a property, which was separate from the agricultural income.
The counsel appearing for the minor child had vehemently challenged the averments made in the affidavit filed by the father thereby claiming that he had deliberately mis-stated facts before the Court.
"Considering the fact that the present appeal is directed against the fixation of the interim maintenance at the rate of Rs. 15,000/- per month, which we have raised to Rs. 25,000/- per month, and the appellant's petition is still pending consideration before the learned Family Court, we are inclined to relegate the parties to the learned Family Court to establish their respective claims/ defence before the learned Family Court, and to invite the final order from the learned Family Court," the Court said. 
The Court therefore disposed of the appeal with a direction to the respondent father to continue to pay Rs. 25,000 per month to the minor child till the disposal of the petition preferred by the child, or till further orders that the Family Court may pass. 
"The right of the appellant to seek further enhancement, even at the interim stage, is preserved. No adjournments shall be sought by the parties, nor should either of the parties be granted any undue adjournments by the learned Family Court, and we request the learned Family Court to dispose of the petition pending before it under Section 20 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 within the next one year," the Court added. 
The Court said that all rights and contentions of the parties, including those raised in the appeal, were preserved and shall be examined by the Family Court.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that recovery of an article/weapon from a place hitherto unknown to anybody else including the investigating officer, is a fact that underlines the confirmation theory which is at the heart of provisions of Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act.
The bench of Justice Suneet Kumar and Justice Jyotsna Sharma observed thus as it affirmed the conviction of a murder accused who had murdered his pregnant step-mother along with her three kids i.e., his step-siblings.
The Court also took into account the fact that the accused had himself retrieved a blood-stained axe, hidden inside the bushes in the presence of the police and a witness [PW9-Ishrar] on the next of the incident and the same was an admissible piece of evidence under section 27 of Indian Evidence Act.
It may be noted that the conditions necessary for the applicability of Section 27 of the Evidence Act [How much of information received from accused may be proved] are:
(1) Discovery of fact in consequence of information received from the accused;
(2) Discovery of such fact to be deposed to;
(3) The accused must be in police custody when he gave information and
(4) So much of information as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered is admissible.
The case in brief
As per the FIR, the informant-Abdul Rashid (father of the accused), on returning to his house, found a crowd of people at his doorstep and was told by them that his own son Shamshad, who was in an inebriated state, assaulted and inflicted wounds by a 'kulhari' on the neck of the informant's wife (Chhoti), and his 3 children. It was also mentioned in the FIR that the people of the locality saw the accused Shamshad escaping with 'kulhari' held in his hands.
Before the Court, PW1-Chhotte and PW2-Sirajuddin, the residents of the same Village deposed that the victim was often harassed by his stepson (accused) and on the day of occurrence, when they went to her house they saw with their own eyes that the Accused was assaulting the deceased persons with an axe inflicting injuries. When they tried to intervene, he ran towards them in attacking mode. The witnesses tried to catch hold of him, but he escaped towards the jungle and could not be apprehended.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court observed that the testimony of PW-4 (father of the accused) evoked confidence and was one of the most important pieces of evidence in this case and the same came within the scope of Section 6 of the Indian Evidence Act.
Regarding the recovery of the weapon, the Court noted that PW9-Ishrar and PW10- S.I. Sri Ram testified that the blood-stained axe was recovered (at the instance of the accused) from a spot different from the place of occurrence of the crime. 
"In this case before us, the evidence of PW9 and PW10 further strengthens the prosecution case in the light of the above provisions of law. In our view, the evidence led by the prosecution on this count, is not only admissible and relevant under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act but also tantamounts to the evidence of the conduct of an accused which too is relevant," the Court remarked as it noted that no plausible explanation was offered by accused in his defence.
With this, the Court held that the appeal lacked merits and was liable to be dismissed and was thereby dismissed and the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.

In a pathbreaking judgment on bail jurisprudence, the Supreme Court has held that undue delay in trial can be a ground to grant bail to an accused, despite the rigours of Section 37 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985.
A division bench of Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Dipankar Datta, while granting bail to an undertrial prisoner arrested seven years ago for allegedly being part of a ganja-supplying gang, held:
 “Grant of bail on ground of undue delay in trial cannot be said to be fettered by Section 37 of the Act, given the imperative of Section 436A which is applicable to offences under the NDPS Act too”
 Significantly, the Court also held that only a prima facie consideration is required under Section NDPS Act, "as a plain and literal interpretation of the conditions under Section 37 would effectively exclude grant of bail altogether".
As per Section 37 of the NDPS Act, the Court can grant bail to the accused only if it is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.
This appeal had arisen out of a case involving the supply of ganja, in which four of the appellant’s co-accused were found to be in possession of more than a hundred kilograms of the prohibited substance and the appellant, one Mohd. Muslim, was subsequently implicated on the basis of the confessional statement of one of the co-accused. The court also noted that the appellant was only 23 years old at the time of his arrest. The matter travelled in appeal to the top court after the Delhi High Court rejected his application for regular bail.
Section 37 NDPS Act only requires only prima facie determination
 In the judgement authored by Justice Bhat, the bench explained that while the right of an accused to be granted bail was circumscribed by the legal exceptions contained in special acts such as the NDPS Act, the standard to be considered, even within the context of Section 37 of the act, would be that of a prima facie determination.
 “The court would look at the material in a broad manner, and reasonably see whether the accused’s guilt may be proved. The judgments of this court have emphasised that the satisfaction which courts are expected to record, i.e., that the accused may not be guilty, is only prima facie, based on a reasonable reading, which does not call for meticulous examination of the materials collected during investigation.”
Plain and literal interpretation of Section 37 NDPS will effectively exclude the grant of bail
The bench noted that in earlier judgements, such conditions had generally been upheld on the ground that the liberty of such accused as citizens of the country, be balanced against the public interest. However, the bench acknowledged that a plain and literal interpretation of the conditions under Section 37 requiring the court to be satisfied that the accused is not guilty and would not commit any offence, would effectively exclude grant of bail altogether, “resulting in punitive detention and unsanctioned preventive detention as well”. The bench categorically stated:
 “Therefore, the only manner in which such special conditions as enacted under Section 37 can be considered within constitutional parameters is where the court is reasonably satisfied on a prima facie look at the material on record that the accused is not guilty. Any other interpretation, would result in complete denial of the bail to a person accused of offences such as those enacted under Section 37 of the NDPS Act.”
Stringent bail conditions were enacted on the condition that trial will be expedited
The Court noted that Section 37 NDPS Act and other similar provisions with such stringent conditions for bail, such as  Section 43D of the UAPA, Section 45 of the PMLA, have been upheld.
"when stringent provisions are enacted, curtailing the provisions of bail, and restricting judicial discretion, it is on the basis that investigation and trials would be concluded swiftly", the Court noted in this regard after referring to precedents.
Reference was also made to the decision in Union of India vs Najeeb where it was held that stringent conditions under UAPA will not fetter the right of Constitutional Courts to grant bail on the ground of violation of fundamental rights. 
The judgment also referred to precedents which hold that right to speedy trial is a fundamental right.
Court refers to statistics on undertrial prisoners
 Before concluding, the bench referred to some important figures revealed in a response by the union home ministry on the floor of the House. The National Crime Records Bureau had recorded that as on December 31, 2021, the bench noted, over 5,54,034 prisoners were lodged in jails against total capacity of 4,25,069 lakhs in the country. Of these 122,852 were convicts; the rest 4,27,165 were undertrials. 
 The court further added, “Laws which impose stringent conditions for grant of bail, may be necessary in public interest; yet, if trials are not concluded in time, the injustice wrecked on the individual is immeasurable. Jails are overcrowded and their living conditions, more often than not, appalling. The danger of unjust imprisonment, is that inmates are at risk of ‘prisonisation’.” 
There is a further danger of the prisoner turning to crime, “as a crime not only turns admirable, but the more professional the crime, the more honour is paid to the criminal”, the court held. It was also noted that incarceration had further deleterious effects – where the accused belonged to the weakest economic strata – immediate loss of livelihood, and in several cases, scattering of families as well as loss of family bonds and alienation from society. Having explained this, the bench concluded by saying:
 The courts, therefore, have to be sensitive to these aspects (because in the event of an acquittal, the loss to the accused is irreparable), and ensure that trials – especially in cases, where special laws enact stringent provisions, are taken up and concluded speedily.”

In observing so, it has refused to grant anticipatory bail under Section 438 of CrPC to the Applicant accused of offences under Sections 384, 114 and 294B and 506(2) of IPC and Sections 7,12,13(1)(a) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988.
 The Applicant (presently suspended) was serving as police sub-inspector in a Mahila Police Station in Bhuj. The Applicant along with the driver had intercepted a car wherein they discovered narcotic substances in a polythene bag in the car. The driver threatened the Complainant to book a false case under the NDPS Act unless 1 lakhs were paid to them. Thereafter, they negotiated and finalised the amount of INR 50,000. 
 The Applicant was quoted as saying, "as a main person, when he could not manage the remaining amount, then, booked him in NDPS Case", when the Complainant could not pay the full amount. Subsequently, the driver and the Applicant coerced the Complainant to pay the amount and even trebled it. 
The informant filed an FIR against the accused driver and the Applicant for criminal intimidation and extortion and as a result, FIR was registered under Sections 384, 114, 294(B) and 506(2) of the IPC. It was also alleged that the driver had given INR 15,000 to the Applicant here. Consequently, Sections 7, 13, 13(1)(a) read with Section 13 (2) of the Act were added by the Investigating Officer.
 The Applicant's anticipatory bail application was rejected by the Sessions Court on the basis that the Applicant was present during the incident and had partaken in the overt act of demanding and extorting money despite her post.
 However, the Applicant contested that she had been falsely implicated in the case basis the statement of the co-accused. Further, there was no evidence to suggest that she had received 15,000 via Google Pay. No offence was made out under Section 384 since she did not make any conversation with the Informant when the car was intercepted. Section 17A of the Act also does not permit any arrest, inquiry or investigation into the offence alleged to have been committed by the public servant without prior approval of the State Government, which was not sought in the instant case. 
Per contra, the Respondent authority contested that the Applicant ought to be denied bail considering the seriousness of the offence and the interest of the society at large. 
 Addressing these contentions, Justice Ilesh Vora remarked that the powers under Section 438 CrPC are extraordinary in nature and must be exercised sparingly. Hence, anticipatory bail can only be granted in exceptional circumstances where the Court is of prima facie view that the Applicant was implicated falsely. However, per Justice Vora this did not seem to be the case here, since the alleged act was in the knowledge of the Applicant. It was her duty to not harass the informant or if the substance was found, to report the case.
"A bare reading of the FIR, would show that throughout the incident, she did not restrain the driver Haribhai for alleged extortion and demand of illegal gratification which he demanded under the guise of registration of false case."
Referring to Section 17A, the Court affirmed that this provision was not applicable to caseas the case is not relatable to any recommendation made or decision taken by the applicant herein in discharge of official function or duties.
Reliance was placed on Velluswamy Vs State, 2019(8) SCC 396, wherein, it was observed by the Apex Court that "actions of direct evidence for demand and acceptance or conspiracy held, irrelevant if circumstantial evidence unhesitatingly points towards the accused as being a part of design for obtaining illegal gratification. Therefore, at this stage, the issue raised having no any merits."
 In Subramanian Swamy Vs. C.B.I, (2014) 8 SCC 682, it was observed "corruption is an enemy of the nation and tracking down corrupt public servants and punishing such persons is a necessary mandate of the 1988 Act."
 Accordingly, keeping in view these precedents and circumstances of the case, the Bench rejected the pre-arrest bail application.
 Case Title: ARCHANA MUKESH RAVAL Versus STATE OF GUJARAT
Case No.: R/CR.MA/6233/2020

The Supreme Court has reiterated that Section 300 CrPC bars the trial of a person not only for the same offence but also for any other offence on the same facts.
The court was hearing a Criminal Appeal that was filed assailing the judgment and order passed by the High Court of Kerala in Criminal Appeal Nos. 947 and 948 of 2009 by which the judgment of conviction and order of sentence passed in C.C. No. 24 and 25 of 2003 by the Trial Court had been upheld by dismissing the aforesaid appeals and consequently confirming the conviction of the appellant herein.
The Impugned Judgment
The Trial Court vide its judgment and order dated 27.04.2009 in both the aforesaid cases had convicted the appellant for offences under Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and had sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years and to pay a fine of Rupees Two Thousand and in default thereof, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months. The accused was further convicted for the offence under Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years and to pay a fine of Rupees Two Thousand and in default thereof, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months. The sentences were directed to run concurrently. 
Brief Facts of the Case
The allegation against the accused was that while the accused was working as Agricultural Officer, State Seed Farm, Perambra, for the period 31.05.1991 to 31.05.1994, he abused his official position as a public servant and committed criminal breach of trust and misappropriated amounts from the auctioning of coconuts during the period from 27.04.1992 to 25.08.1992, by not remitting the same to the Sub-Treasury, Perambra. 
As a result of which a surprise inspection was carried out in the State Seed Farm, Perambra and the inspection team found that the cash book was not properly maintained and that the Agricultural Officer received amounts from the Treasury. The inspection report was submitted to the Director of Agriculture. On the basis of the said report, an enquiry was conducted by the vigilance department and a criminal case was registered against the accused. On completion of investigation, the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau submitted three reports and three criminal cases were registered against the accused under Section 13(1)(c) read with Section 13(2) of the Act and Sections 409 and 477A of IPC. The Accounts Officer conducted an audit in the State Seed Farm, pertaining to the period from 31.05.1991 to 31.05.1994 and gave a report. On the basis of the same, the two cases, out of which this appeal arises, were registered against the appellant.
Arguments of the Appellant
The stand that the appellant took before the Supreme Court assailing the judgment of the Trial Court and later upheld by the High Court, is as follows:
During the period in question, the Appellant had additional charge of some other farms and had to heavily depend on his subordinates at the office to conduct the affairs of the State Seed Farm, Perambra.
The Appellant is a public servant. Section 197(1) of the CrPC requires sanction of the State Government before taking cognizance of offence against public servants such as the accused.
The entire prosecution proceedings in the present cases are barred by Section 300(1) of the CrPC which incorporates the principle of double jeopardy. The Appellant was already prosecuted in the year 1999 for the charges of misappropriating public funds entrusted to him, when C.C. No.12 to 14/1999 were filed against him. The core allegation in all the five cases is one and the same i.e., making false entries in the cash book and misappropriating money.
The FIR in the present cases was filed on 03.12.2001 after the appellant was dismissed from the service and the judgment of the Trial Court was passed. The allegations/offences in the present two cases could have been framed at the previous trial and the appellant herein could have been tried for the same along with the trial of the earlier three cases.
If the Appellant was to be tried again for the present offences, previous consent of the State Government was necessary as is mandated under sub-section (2) of Section 300 of the CrPC.
The conviction of the appellant herein under Section 409 of the IPC has no legal basis since the prosecution could not prove the most vital ingredient of the said offence, namely, entrustment of goods or dominion over property.
The conviction under Section 13(1)(c) of the Act is not made out since the prosecution failed to prove that the property was entrusted to him or was under his control, and that the same was fraudulently or dishonestly misappropriated by him.
Discussion on Double Jeopardy
The court held, "Articles 20 to 22 deal with personal liberty of citizens and others. Article 20(2) expressly provides that no person shall be prosecuted or punished for the same offence, more than once. The protection against double jeopardy is also supplemented by statutory provisions contained in Section 300 of the CrPC, Section 40 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, Section 71 of the IPC and Section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897." 
Discussing the relevance of Section 300 CrpC, the court held, "Section 300 of the CrPC places a bar wherein, a person who has already been tried by a Court of competent jurisdiction for an offence arising out of the same facts, and has either been acquitted or convicted of such offence cannot be tried again for the same offence as well as on the same facts for any other offence as long as such acquittal or conviction remains in force."
Judgment
Relating the mandate of Section 300 CrPC with the facts of the instant case, the court, in the words of Justice BV. Nagarathna, held, "The appellant herein was earlier charged for offences under Section 13(1)(c) read with Section 13(2) of the Act and Sections 409 and 477A of the IPC and was convicted in two cases and acquitted in one case. The present two cases arise out of the same set of facts and the same transaction as that in the previous three cases wherein the appellant was tried and convicted/acquitted respectively. For an offence to be considered as the 'same offence' as the last offence, it is necessary to show that the offences are not distinct and the ingredients of the offences are identical. The previous charge as well as the present charge is for the same period of misappropriation. The matter of offences in all the previous three cases and the present case are the same and are said to be committed in the course of the same transaction while holding the one and same post of Agricultural Officer by the appellant."
The court further held that, "The appellant is right in contending that the charge in the first three cases were framed on 17.08.1999 which is much after the audit and the prosecution would have been well aware of the misappropriation in respect of the present cases on 17.08.1999."
The court further remarked that, "It has already been observed that the allegations/offences in the instant cases are the same as the allegations/offences in the previous three cases, therefore as per the mandate under Section 300(2) of the CrPC, the consent of the State Government is necessary. Even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that the allegations are different in present cases from those in the previous cases, the prosecution has failed to obtain the prior consent of the State Government necessary to prosecute the accused-appellant and therefore the trial in the instant case is unlawful."
The judgment was delivered by the division bench of Justices B.R. Gavai and B.V. Nagarathna.

Read the Judgment here 

The Allahabad High Court has observed that a woman can not commit the offence of rape but if she facilitates the act of rape with a group of people then she may be prosecuted for 'Gang Rape' under Section 376D Of IPC in view of the amended provisions.
Perusing the provisions of Section 375 and 376 IPC (as amended by Act 13 of 2013 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860), the bench of Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav rejected the argument that a woman cannot be prosecuted for the alleged commission of the offence of gang rape.
With this, the Court also rejected a Section 482 CrPC plea moved by one Suneeta Pandey who has been summoned by Additional District and Sessions Judge- Ist, Siddharth Nagar to face the trial u/s 376-D, 212 IPC in connection with the alleged rape case of a 15-year-old girl.
"A woman can not commit the offence of rape but if she facilitated the act of rape with a group of people then she may be prosecuted for Gang Rape in view of the amended provisions" : #AllahabadHighCourt pic.twitter.com/P8aRkP9lF6— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) February 13, 2023
Essentially, as per the facts of the case, the incident took place in June 2015 and the FIR was lodged by the informant against unknown persons in July 2015 under sections 363 and 366 I.P.C. alleging therein that someone has enticed away the daughter of the informant aged about 15 years and took her with him.
In her Section 164 CrPC statement, the victim stated that the applicant was involved in the alleged incident, however, she was not named in the charge sheet. Thereafter, opposite party no.2 filed an application under Section 319 Cr.P.C. for summoning the applicant and the court below allowed the said plea.
Pursuant to this, the applicant moved the High Court seeking to quash the summoning order as well as to stay the further proceedings in the case on the ground that being a lady, no offence under Section 376-D I.P.C. is made out against the applicant and that she has been wrongly summoned by the trial court. 
Taking into account the facts of the case, the Court, at the outset noted that the argument that a lady cannot be prosecuted for gang rape is not correct as per the amended provisions of Section 375 to 376E IPC by Act 13 of 2013 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860
The Court observed that though it is clear by the non-ambiguous language of section 375 of IPC that a woman can't commit rape as the section specifically states that the act of rape can only be done by a ‘man’ and not by “any woman”, however, the Court added, the same is not the case with Section 376D (Gang Rape).
"The term 'person' used in the Section should not be construed in a narrow sense. Section 11 I.P.C. defines ‘person’ as it includes any company or association or body of persons whether incorporated or not. The word 'person' is also defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary in two ways: firstly, it is defined as 'an individual human being' or 'a man, woman, or child'; and, secondly, as 'the living body of a human being'. As such, a woman can not commit the offense of rape but if she facilitated the act of rape with a group of people then she may be prosecuted for Gang Rape in view of the amended provisions. Unlike man, a woman can also be held guilty of sexual offences. A woman can also be held guilty of gang rape if she has facilitated the act of rape with a group of person," the Court remarked,
In its order, the Court also explained the scope of 'Gang Rape' by observing that in order to establish an offence under Section 376-D IPC, the prosecution has to adduce evidence to indicate that one or more persons had acted in concert and in such an event, if rape had been committed by even one, all the accused will be guilty irrespective of the fact that victim had been raped by one or more of them. 
In other words, the Court clarified that this provision embodies a principle of joint liability and the essence of that liability is the existence of common intention that common intention presupposes prior concert which may be determined from the conduct of offenders revealed during the course of action. 
With this, the Court dismissed the plea.

The Allahabad High Court last week directed its Registrar General to lodge a First Information Report (FIR) in the matter, after it found that 3 petitions were filed before the Court in the name of an advocate who has already died.
 The Bench of Justice Samit Gopal was presiding over a bail plea, filed in the name of the deceased lawyer, when it noted that 3 other pleas have also been filed in the name of the same advocate who has reportedly passed away in the year 2014.
 "The common feature in all the three above petitions is that Sri Aditya Narayan Singh, Advocate (who is reported to have died on 16.05.2014) has been the sole counsel in two matters and one of the counsels in the writ petition," the Court remarked.
 Background of the matter
 The Court was hearing the bail plea of on behalf of two murder accused Kamlesh Yadav and Rajesh Chauhan (again, filed in the name of the deceased advocate), however, even when no one appeared on behalf of them, the Court took up the matter in the revised list, and noted thus:
 "The present bail application is an example of a mischievous filing of a case before a Court of law by fictitious person(s)."
 Earlier, on July 26, appearing before the Court, an Advocate named Abhishek Kumar had informed the Court that though the bail application was shown to be filed by advocate Aditya Narayan Singh and Advocate Rajesh Chandra Tiwari, however, alleged that it was mischief by someone.
 He further informed the Court that Advocate Aditya Narayan Singh had expired around two years back and the Advocate Roll No. A/R1202/12 is of some one else, and not of Sri Rajesh Chandra Tiwari.
 He also apprised the Court of three other pleas, in which the said deceased advocate had been named as an advocate.
 Under these circumstances, the Court observed thus:
 "…it is apparent that the present bail application has been filed in a clandestine manner for the reasons best known to the person(s) who have played mischief by filing the same and then not appearing before the Court to press the same." 
 Further, noting that the bail application is a bogus bail application and that the Court cannot shut its eye to the said issue, the Court prima facie opined that the bail application had been filed in clandestine manner. 
 Lastly, the Registrar General was directed to register an FIR in the matter and also directed that the investigation in the matter be done seriously so as to cull out the truth and appropriate action be taken against person(s) involved in the bogus and clandestine filing of the bail application.
 "The needful be done within one month from today. 16. The Senior Superintendent of Police, Prayagraj is directed to ensure that the investigation is done by a responsible and a competent police officer efficiently," the Court further added.

"This order is an attempt to release the caged parrot (CBI)", the High Court observed while issuing a slew of directions for the independence of CBI.The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday observed that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) should be made more independent like the Election Commission of India and the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday observed that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) should be made more independent like the Election Commission of India and the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. 
Notably, the Court directed the Central Government to consider bringing a separate Act giving statutory status with more powers and jurisdiction to CBI at the earliest. It may be noted that the CBI is at present constituted as per an executive notification under the Delhi Special Police  Establishment Act. The Gauhati High Court, in 2013, had quashed the said notification and held the CBI's formation to be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court stayed the High Court order, which is still continuing (Read more about this here).
Taking into consideration that the public reposes enormous faith and trust in CBI, the premiere investigative agency, a Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi passed a slew of directions and observed that the instant order 'is an attempt to release the "Caged Parrot" (CBI). "Caged Parrot" is a term used by the Supreme Court to describe the CBI in 2013. "CBI is a caged parrot speaking his master's voice", a bench headed by the then CJI RM Lodha had observed then.
CBI lacks manpower, resources : High Court
The Madras High Court's directions came in a petition filed by Ramanathapuram District Pathikkapattor Sangam seeking CBI probe into a chit fund scam. However, the Bench declined to refer the case to the CBI.
The Court opined at the outset that despite the frequent referral of cases to CBI for investigation, there is a recurrent practice of CBI being unable to conduct prompt investigation due to a lack of resources and manpower. 
"When such is the trust and faith of the people, very sadly CBI is dragging its feet, whenever there is a demand for CBI enquiry on the ground that resources and man power available with CBI are very restricted and therefore, it cannot conduct investigations. This is the usual stereotype version/defence of the CBI before the Courts", the Court opined. 
Further enumerating upon the immense credibility of the CBI, the Court remarked, 
"An aura of reverence is attached to the name of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). There is always a clamour for CBI investigation." Whenever any sensitive, heinous crimes are committed and there is no proper investigation by the local police, there is a demand for CBI investigation and the said demand for CBI investigation is increasing day by day due to the credibility of the Central Bureau of Investigation. People revere CBI as a premier trust worthy agency, which could investigate the cases impartially and fairly and prosecute the case before the Court efficiently and properly" 
The Court vide its earlier order dated December 8, 2020 had taken serious objections to the CBI's inability to investigate important offences due to a lack of resources and had accordingly proceeded to pose a series of queries regarding the manpower, infrastructure capabilities, funds allocated when it comes to the investigating agency. 
Many CBI cases end in acquittal : High Court
"Many cases which are investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation, even serious cases, have ended in acquittal. It badly reflects upon the investigation of CBI. Hence, time has come to look into problems faced by CBI. Investigation of CBI needs to be improved by adding experts and modern gadgets", the Court had opined with anguish in its earlier order. 
On Tuesday, the Court directed the Central government to take a decision on the comprehensive proposal for cadre review and restructuring of CBI within a period of one month. This direction was issued in light of the submission made that a proposal dated September 9, 2020 for comprehensive cadre review and restructuring of CBI and for creation of 734 additional posts in different ranks is pending with the Central Government. 
"When there is a huge pendency in CFSL, either the infrastructure of CFSL has to be augmented or another CFSL should be established. Therefore there shall be a direction to the Central Government to enhance the infrastructural facilities available with CFSL in Ghaziabad, Uttarpradesh or to establish CFSL, zone wise, so that there would not be any delay in getting the opinion of the experts. The Central Government should establish at least one CFSL in each zone viz., South, East, West within one year", the Court further directed. 
Furthermore, it was observed that officials and staff should be independently recruited by the CBI and given proper training instead of depending upon the deputation from police forces and other forces. In this regard the CBI was instructed to send a comprehensive proposal to the Central Government for approval. 
Opining on the urgent need to augment the independence of CBI for the sake of impartial, neutral and credible investigation of cases, the Court made a reference to the observations made by the Supreme Court in Vineet Narayanan v. Union of India wherein it was observed that the "CBI is a caged parrot speaking in its master's voice'.
"The said observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is fortified by the statement made by the CBI Director before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Coal allocation case that a former Law Minister meddled with the statement of CBI filed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court", the Court further noted.
The Bench also opined that Constitutional Courts also refer various cases to CBI for investigation sometimes even without State's consent which indicates the immense faith that public institutions have in the agency. Accordingly, the following pertinent directions were issued in order to enhance the efficiency of the investigating agency.
Directions issued:
•	Government of India is directed to consider and take a decision for enactment of a separate Act giving statutory status with more powers and jurisdiction to CBI at the earliest. 
•	CBI shall be made more independent like Election Commission of India and Comptroller and Auditor General of India. 
•	Separate budgetary allocation shall be made for CBI. 
•	Director of CBI shall be given powers as that of the Secretary to the Government and shall directly report to the Minister/Prime Minister without going through DoPT. 
•	Central Government shall make CBI independent with functional autonomy without administrative control of the Government. 
•	CFSL shall have more modern facilities and should be augmented on par with the facilities available to Federal Bureau of Investigation in United States of America and Scotland Yard in United Kingdom. 
•	DoPT is directed to pass orders on the CBI restructuring letter dated 09.09.2020 after consulting with other departments if necessary, within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. 
•	CBI should file a well thought out Policy within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order, for permanently recruiting (i) Cyber Forensic experts and (ii) Financial Audit experts, so that all the branches/wings of CBI should have these experts available with them and not on case to case basis. 
•	DoPT should clear all the pending proposals pertaining to CBI's infrastructure development e.g. land construction, residential accommodation, upgradation of available technical gadgets etc., within a period of six weeks. 
•	CFSL attached to CBI should clear all the pending cases as on 31.12.2020. Similarly, other FSLs should also offer their Forensic opinion pending as on 31.12.2020 within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. 
•	The details of cases wherein charges have not been framed by the Trial Courts despite the charge sheets having been filed by CBI for more than one year, should be shared by Director, CBI with the respective Registrar Generals of the High Courts. 
•	Since CBI itself has stated in reply to Para 'O' that CBI has to work within the constraints of shortage of manpower, Director, CBI should send another detailed proposal seeking further increase in the divisions/wings as well as strength of Officers in CBI to the Government of India within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and Government of India should pass orders on the same within a period of three months of its receipt.

In a contempt petition filed against a Police Inspector alleging willful disobedience of the court order, Madras High Court observed that the police department is running with 90 per cent corruptive officers as on date.
Justice P. Velmurugan remarked that the Department is also plagued by police officials not having the required expertise to go forth with an investigation. According to the judge, only 10 per cent of the officers are 'honest and abled' but they alone cannot do all the investigation.
"...Though this Court finds that the capacity of the investigating officer is not up to the mark, and within her capacity she has investigated the case, the incapacity of the investigation officer cannot be treated as wilfully disobeying of the order of this Court. Unfortunately, as on date, the police department is running with 90% of the corruptive officers as well the officers not having adequate capacity to do the investigation and only 10% of the officers are honest and abled officers. The 10% of officials alone cannot do all the investigation."
Therefore, the court further observed that it is the right time to sensitise police officials, find out and eradicate corrupt officers and give adequate training to officers who are not corrupt but lacking in investigational skills. 
The High Court also added that the aggrieved petitioner has the liberty to initiate action against the Inspector for her incapacity and to work out a remedy before the Judicial Magistrate.
The court also noted that,
"It is relevant to state that on the date of preferring original complaint the alleged executor of the sale deed was very much alive, if the respondent police immediately examined the said Kamalam, the entire truth would have come out. Whereas till the death of the said Kamalam, the respondent police did not examine her."
The contempt petition was filed by a power of attorney holder who had previously filed a complaint for cheating, forgery and criminal intimidation in relation to a sale deed. 
The Police booked the accused for offences under Sections 147, 148, 447, 294(b), 120(b), 420, 467, 468, 471 and 506(ii) IPC. The investigation was completed, the case was closed as 'mistake of fact', and the referred charge sheet ( RCS) was filed before the judicial magistrate. However, the RCS notice was not served to the de facto complainant. 
Subsequently, the High Court directed police to serve the RCS notice and granted the petitioner liberty to file protest petition. The petitioner/ power of attorney holder filed a protest petition before the Tiruchengode Judicial Magistrate. The directions given by the Magistrate was challenged in High Court via a criminal revision petition by the de facto complainant.
High Court directed the police to conduct a fresh investigation to be completed in three months. Once again, the respondent police closed the case as 'mistake of fact', served the RCS notice and filed the final report before the Magistrate. Therefore, a contempt petition was filed by the de facto complainant alleging willful disobeying of the previous High Court order in the criminal revision petition.
The petitioners contended that the police has not conducted the investigation in a fair manner. Similarly, the respondent Inspector argued that after a fresh examination of witnesses including the attestors of the sale deed, the police reached a conclusion that the dispute between the parties is civil in nature and there is no prima facie offence made out, which is why the case was closed as a 'mistake of fact'.
The court observed as follows after hearing both sides:
"Based on the statement of the list of witnesses, the learned Magistrate has come to the conclusion that the dispute between the parties is civil in nature and therefore, the respondent police has closed the criminal case ...On a careful perusal of the records, this Court does not find that the respondent police wilfully disobey the order of this Court. Since then respondent police, after completion of the investigation, has filed charge sheet before the Jurisdictional Magistrate Court, the petitioner can file protest petition before the Judicial Magistrate and proceed with the case in accordance with law."

Hinting that a proclaimed offender may also move an anticipatory bail plea, the Allahabad High Court has observed that Section 438 of CrPC doesn't say that a proclaimed offender would be barred to file such a plea.
The bench of Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan further observed that Section 82 CrPC (Proclamation for person absconding) neither creates any rider nor imposes any restrictions in filing anticipatory bail application by the proclaimed offender.
In this regard, the Court also referred to the Apex Court's ruling in the case of Lavesh vs. State (NCT of Delhi) (2012) 8 SCC 730 to note that the Top Court had used the word 'Normally', meaning thereby, the High Court explained, "normally the anticipatory bail application of the proclaimed offender should not be entertained".
Here it may be noted by the readers that in the Lavesh case (supra), the Top Court had observed thus:
"Normally, when the accused is "absconding" and declared as a "proclaimed offender", there is no question of granting anticipatory bail. We reiterate that when a person against whom a warrant had been issued and is absconding or concealing himself in order to avoid execution of warrant and declared as a proclaimed offender in terms of Section 82 of the Code is not entitled the relief of anticipatory bail."
It may be noted that the same bench (Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan) had last week observed that the initiation of the process of proclamation or attachment proceedings under Section 82 or 83 of CrPC after the filing of an anticipatory bail plea by an accused does not bar the consideration of such a bail application.

The matter before the Court
Apprehending his arrest in a case under sections 323, 504, 506, 313, 376, 377 IPC, one Suresh Babu moved a 438 CrPC application seeking pre-arrest bail after his earlier plea was dismissed by the sessions court.
Allegations against the applicant are that on the pretext of the false promise of marriage, he exploited and established physical relations with the informant, and thereafter, he refused to marry her. 
Essentially, he had filed a pre-arrest bail plea before the Sessions Court on March 16, 2022, and the proclamation u/s 82 Cr.P.C. was issued on March 24, 2022 (during the pendency of bail plea), and the bail plea was rejected on April 5, 2022. 
While rejecting the anticipatory bail application, the sessions court had noted that the proclamation under section 82 Cr.P.C. had been issued against the accused. Now, he moved to the High Court seeking pre-arrest bail.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court said that the accused/applicant was not declared as a proclaimed offender on March 16, 2021, the date of filing anticipatory bail, therefore, the Court remarked thus:
"...to me such bar could not restrain the present applicant to file his anticipatory bail application before this Court under same section i.e. section 438 Cr.P.C. and, therefore, his anticipatory bail application may be heard and disposed of finally on merits...It has nowhere been indicated u/s 438 Cr.P.C. that the proclaimed offender would be barred to file such application. As to whether such proclaimed offender would be granted anticipatory bail or not would depend upon the facts and circumstances of the particular issue and also on the basis of bar, so imposed by the Apex Court in re: Lavesh (supra), Pradeep Sharma (supra) and Prem Shankar Prasad (supra)."
Therefore, the Court discarded the objection raised by the counsel for the opposite parties regarding the maintainability of the instant application for the reason that the proclamation u/s 82/83 Cr.P.C. had been issued against the applicant.
Regarding the allegations against the applicant, the Court prima facies observed that if the physical relationship had been established on the false promise of marriage and the physical relation was consensual in nature and it lasted for a long time, prima facie it may not be treated as rape but it may be considered as a breach of promise.
Consequently, taking into account the fact that the instant F.I.R. had been lodged after the unexplained delay of one year three months, and twenty-three days and the undertaking of the applicant that he shall cooperate with the investigation, the Court found it appropriate to protect the liberty till filing of the charge-sheet and allowed his bail plea.
However, considering the fact that the accused has not appeared before the investigating officer as yet, therefore, the Court directed the accused to appear before the investigating officer on July 25, 2022.

The Supreme Court observed that its single bench while hearing a Transfer Petition cannot invoke power under Article 142 of the Constitution to pass a decree for dissolving a marriage by mutual consent.
In this case, the parties (husband and wife) to a transfer petition before the Supreme Court filed a joint application for divorce by mutual consent of the parties. They requested the court to invoke jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, and to dispense with the compliance of some of the procedural formalities and timeline contemplated in Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act. The transfer petition was filed by the wife seeking transfer of the divorce petition filed by the husband from the Family Court, Pune, Maharashtra to the Principal Judge, Family Court, Gautam Budh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh. 
Single Bench Has Article 142 Powers
Justice Aniruddha Bose observed that, since the provisions of Article 142 of the Constitution of India vests the Court with the jurisdiction to pass any order or decree to do complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it, a Judge sitting singly has the power and jurisdiction to issue orders or pass decrees as specified in the said Article. The judge referred to recent judgment in Rhea Chakraborty vs. State of Bihar in this regard.
"It would be evident from sub Clause (2) of Article 145 that subject to the provisions of Clause (3) thereof, rules made under the said Article may fix the minimum number of Judges who are to sit for any purpose and such rules may provide for the powers of Single Judges and Division Courts. The power or jurisdiction of a Single Judge is derived from the proviso to Order VI Rule (1) of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013. I have reproduced the said Rule in the preceding paragraph. The present petition for transfer comes within the domain or jurisdiction of the Judge sitting singly. Since the provisions of Article 142 of the Constitution of India vests this Court with the jurisdiction to pass any order or decree to do complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it, a Judge sitting singly has the power and jurisdiction to issue orders or pass decrees as specified in the said Article.", the court noted.
'Annulment of marriage' Does Not Come Within Four Categories Mentioned In Proviso To Order VI Rule (1)SC Rules
However, the court noted that, while a Single Judge of the Court can exercise jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, this power or jurisdiction has to be confined to the four categories of cases referred to in the proviso to Order VI Rule (1) of the 2013 Rules only, or on subjects ancillary or directly relatable to them. 
"Referring a case forming the core dispute in a transfer petition to mediation obviously comes within the subjects relatable to the lis pending before the Court. Annulment of marriage, however, in my view, cannot come within these four categories. I am of the view that while sitting singly this Court does not have the jurisdiction to take a decision on that plea made in the joint application. One of the preconditions for exercise of jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India in passing order or decree for doing complete justice is that the cause or the matter in which the Court intends to invoke the provisions thereof must be pending before it. Annulment of marriage cannot be linked to any cause or matter pending before this Court in the facts of the given case. The transfer petition arose out of matrimonial dispute between the parties, but the expression 'cause or matter pending before it' cannot be stretched to cover all disputes originating from such matrimonial problem that can be resolved by this Court, sitting singly, while hearing a transfer petition. I am not expressing any doubt on the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to pass decree to dissolve a marriage on consent of the parties without adhering to the timeline and other procedural formalities stipulated in Section 13B of the 1955 Act. But I do not think that while sitting singly, such a decree can be passed having regard to the provisions of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013.", the Court said.
The court therefore observed that the joint application ought to be dealt with by a Bench comprising of two or more Judges.

The Jammu and Kashmir High Court has held that all Hindus residing in the Valley cannot be said to be a Kashmiri Pandit, thereby allowing them to avail the benefits of the schemes meant exclusively for the Pandits.

The Jammu and Kashmir High Court has held that all Hindus residing in the Valley cannot be said to be a Kashmiri Pandit, thereby allowing them to avail the benefits of the schemes meant exclusively for the Pandits. While disposing of the plea seeking benefit to the petitioners, under the package for return and rehabilitation of Kashmiri migrants, Justice Sanjeev Kumar held that,
"In the absence of a specific definition of the term "Kashmiri Pandit family," the only way to find out the true meaning of the term is to apply the common parlance principle. There is no denying the fact that in common parlance, Kashmiri Pandit is a community of Kashmiri-speaking Brahmins living in the Valley for generations and are distinctly identified by their dress, customs, and traditions, etc. "Kashmiri Pandits" is a separately identifiable community distinct from other Hindus residing in the Valley like Rajputs, Brahmins other than Kashmiri Pandits, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and many others."
Background
In the year 2009, the Government of India issued Prime Minister's Package for return and rehabilitation to Kashmiri migrants in Kashmir Valley. The said package was later extended to non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits as well.
In December 2020, the State issued an advertisement for filling up 1997 posts while carrying a recruitment drive. The advertisement was also open for the Kashmiri Pandits who had not migrated. However, these categories of people were required to produce bonafide documents certifying that such candidates had not migrated and were, accordingly, not registered with the Commissioner (Relief). The Deputy Commissioners were also to certify that the candidates, seeking the benefit of special recruitment drive carried under Prime Minister's package, belonged to the community described as "Kashmiri Pandits." 
The Deputy Commissioners chose not to grant such certificates in respect of a group of non-migrant Kashmiri Hindus, on the analogy that they did not belong to the community of "Kashmiri Pandits."
After that, the present petition was filed, and by way of an interim measure, the Court allowed them to participate in the selection process. The petitioner now contends that the selection process has been almost concluded and the selection list framed. However, the respondents have withheld the selection of the petitioners on the ground that they do not meet the requirement of production of the "Kashmiri Pandit" certificate issued by the competent authority.
Advocate Altaf Mehraj, appearing for the petitioners, argued that the benefit of the Prime Minister's Package cannot be restricted to only one community, i.e., "Kashmiri Pandits," and ignoring other Hindu castes, communities,, and clans who have similarly suffered due to the onslaught in 1990. It was submitted that all Hindus residing in the Valley and have not migrated constitute one class. Their further classification based on their identities is not permissible in law. It is alleged that the State has refused to issue certificates in bonafide cases in favor of candidates who are similarly situated with the petitioners and carry the surname of "Singh."
It is further argued that the term "Kashmiri Pandits" is wide enough to include all non-migrant castes and communities of Hindus residing in the Valley and have similarly suffered as non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits. 
Assistant Solicitor General of India, T.M. Shamsi, along with Government Advocates Usmani Gani and Sajad Ashraf, opposed the petition by submitting that various posts were created for Kashmiri migrants on a supernumerary basis across various departments. In terms of Rule 2 of the Jammu & Kashmir Migrants (Special Drive) Recruitment Rules, 2009, entitling the following category of people as eligible for the said posts:
(i) a person who has migrated from Kashmir Valley after 1st of November, 1989 and is registered as such with the Relief Commissioner; 
(ii) a person who has migrated from Kashmir Valley after 1st of November, 1989, but has not been so registered with the Relief Commissioner on the ground of his being in service of Government in any moving officer or having left the Valley or any other part of the State in pursuit of occupation or vocation or otherwise and is possessed of immovable property at the place from where he has migrated but is unable to ordinarily reside there due to the disturbed conditions; 
(iii) an internally displaced person who has migrated within Valley from his original place of residence in Kashmir Valley for security reasons and is registered as such with the Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner, Migrants; and
 (iv) a person who belongs to the Kashmiri Pandit Family and has not migrated from Kashmir Valley after 1st of November 1989 and is presently residing in the Kashmir Valley.
Referring to the said classification, it was submitted that category (i), (ii), and (iii), the Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner for Migrants is the designated authority for authentication of the migrant status of the applicants. He has to ensure that the applicant is a bonafide migrant. At the same time, as for the category of persons mentioned at (iv) above, the Deputy Commissioner concerned is the designated authority for authentication of the applicant's status through the issue of the certificate.
It was argued that there was no separate quota within the quota available for any migrant or non-migrant community regarding these posts. It is, thus, submitted that in the absence of challenge to the Recruitment Rules of 2009 by the petitioners, the full effect to the rules is required to be given. Justifying the rejection, they argued that the petitioners who are neither migrants falling in categories (i), (ii), and (iii) nor do they belong to the Kashmiri Pandit family are not eligible to participate in the selection process.
The respondents also brought attention to a 2019 judgment of the Jammu & Kashmir High Court, where the Sikh community living in the Valley approached, submitting that they have similarly suffered like non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits were entitled to have the benefit of Prime Minister's Special Package. They claimed to be considered for 500 posts earmarked for non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits residing in Kashmir Valley. However, the Court has not found a non-migrant Sikh community, which too had stayed back in the Valley and had not migrated during 1990 like the non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits, similarly situated and on par with non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits.
Findings
The Court held that the issue raised by the petitioners is no longer res Integra referring to Kashmiri Sikh Community and Ors. v. State of J&K and Ors. (2019). It remarked, 
"The parity sought by the Sikhs residing in the Valley who had not migrated in the wake of 1990 turmoil, with the non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits for the purposes of implementation of Prime Minister's Special Package of employment and rehabilitation has not been accepted by this Court, and the classification made by SRO 425 of 2017 has been held to be valid, there is hardly any scope for the petitioners to raise the similar contention yet again."
The Court observed that the argument raised is preposterous and cannot be accepted in the face of the clear language of the relevant rule. It needs to be noticed that the petitioners have not challenged SRO 425, whereby the Rules of 2009 have been amended to provide the category of non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits for admitting them to the benefit of a revised package of Prime Minister for employment and rehabilitation.
The Court noted that in the absence of such challenge, the only question that remains to be determined in this petition is whether the petitioners, who are, admittedly, not Kashmiri Pandits but belong to different castes of Hindus, can be brought within the definition of "Kashmiri Pandits."
Refusing to accept the broad definition proposed by the petitioners, the Court noted that in Rule 2(ca) is the term 'Kashmiri Pandit' means a person belonging to 'Kashmiri Pandit Family' who has not migrated from Kashmir Valley after 1st of November, 1989 and is presently residing in Kashmir Valley. 
Applying the common parlance principle, the Court defined Kashmiri Pandit as members of a Kashmiri community speaking Brahmins living in the Valley from generations and are distinctly identified by their dress, customs, traditions, etc. It was held to be a separately identifiable community distinct from other Hindus residing in the Valley like Rajputs, Brahmins other than Kashmiri Pandits, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes,, and many others.
"It is, thus, difficult to accept the contention of learned counsel for the petitioners that the petitioners, who are mostly Kshatriyas, Rajputs, Scheduled Caste non- Kashmiri Brahmins, etc. should be treated as Kashmiri," the Court added.

The Gujarat High Court has observed that the right of a woman to secure a residence order in respect of a shared household cannot be defeated by the simple expedient of securing an order of eviction by adopting the summary procedure under the Senior Citizens Act 2007.
The Bench of Dr. Justice Ashokkumar C. Joshi referred to the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of S Vanitha vs. Deputy Commissioner, Bengaluru Urban District, wherein it was held that the right of a woman to secure a residence order in respect of a shared household cannot be defeated by the simple expedient of securing an order of eviction by adopting the summary procedure under the Senior Citizens Act.
The facts in brief 
Essentially, the petitioner, Jagdeepbhai Chandulal Patel (a senior citizen) is the father-in-law of respondent No. 1, Reshma Ruchin Patel, and the father of the respondent No. 2, who is presently residing in the USA.
Allegedly, his daughter-in-law, respondent No. 1, illegally trespassed his house and eventually, the petitioner had to move out of his house and reside at a different place, and accordingly, he moved a suit before the Family Court at Ahmedabad along with an interim injunction application.
He prayed for the issuance of order/directions to respondent No. 1, along with minor Kashvi to remove themselves from his house and to restrain them from using or occupying the said property as their residence.
 The said application came to be rejected by the Family Court in March 2021. The petitioner's written statement-cum-Reply-cum-injunction application, praying as aforesaid, was also dismissed by way of the impugned order, and therefore, being grieved by the same, the petitioner came to the High Court, under the provisions of the Act of Senior Citizens Act 2007.
He claimed before the High Court that he is entitled to the said dwelling house and thus, an order be issued to evict his daughter-in-law (respondent No. 1) therefrom. 
Whereas, the case of respondent no. 1  is that she, being the daughter-in-law of the petitioner, is entitled to the shared household in her matrimonial home and she cannot be evicted from the same under the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005.
Court's observations
At the outset, the Court noted that the issue, largely involved in the petition was with regard to the applicability of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 vis-a-vis the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and inter se overriding effect thereof.
Referring to S Vanitha vs. Deputy Commissioner, Bengaluru Urban District, the Court came to the conclusion that the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act has no overriding effect over the right of residence of a woman in a shared household within the meaning of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act.
"Allowing the Senior Citizens Act 2007 to have an overriding force and effect in all situations, irrespective of competing entitlements of a woman to a right in a shared household within the meaning of the PWDV Act 2005, would defeat the object and purpose which the Parliament sought to achieve in enacting the latter legislation. The law protecting the interest of senior citizens is intended to ensure that they are not left destitute, or at the mercy of their children or relatives. Equally, the purpose of the PWDV Act 2005 cannot be ignored by a sleight of statutory interpretation. Both sets of legislation have to be harmoniously construed. Hence the right of a woman to secure a residence order in respect of a shared household cannot be defeated by the simple expedient of securing an order of eviction by adopting the summary procedure under the Senior Citizens Act 2007," the Court stressed. 
Further, the Court also observed that the right to reside in the shared household continues till the victim proves that she is a victim of domestic violence. Accordingly, the Court held, that respondent No. 1, under the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act, has the right to a shared household. 
Importantly, the Court also concluded that merely an offer being made to provide another suitable accommodation, cannot snatch away the legitimate right of respondent No. 1 of a shared household.
With this, the Court held that the Family Court did not commit any error and therefore, the petition failed and was dismissed.

The Kerala High Court on Monday held that a person actively involved in politics, whether or not holding an official post, is not eligible to be appointed as a non-hereditary trustee in temples under the Malabar Devaswom Board. 
A division bench comprising of Justice Anil K.Narendran and Justice P.G. Ajithkumar was hearing a plea challenging the appointment of certain persons as non-hereditary trustees in Pookkottukalikavu Temple pursuant to the notification of the Malabar Devaswom Board which stated that active politicians or persons holding official posts in any political party were ineligible for appointment to the post. With regard to the notification, the court observed: 
“The terms are used disjunctively. So persons who are actively involved in politics, whether or not they hold any post in a political party are ineligible” 
The petitioners challenged the appointment of the non-hereditary trustees on two grounds, firstly, that they were office bearers of a political party and secondly that they had criminal cases pending against them. 
It was specifically alleged by the petitioner that the 6th respondent was a Local Committee Secretary of C.P.I.(M), Pookkottukavu Unit, and the 7th respondent was a Branch Secretary of Pookkottukavu Centre Branch of C.P.I.(M) and the 8th respondent was the Meghala Secretary of DYFI. 
The 6th and 7th respondents took the stand that only after their appointments as trustees did they become office bearers of political parties, and therefore at the time of their appointment they were not disqualified for the post. The 8th respondent however contented that DYFI is not a political party hence him holding the said post did not disqualify him from being appointed as non-hereditary trustee of the temple. The court however did not agree with the contentions of the respondents and held that 
“It is a matter of common knowledge that the functioning of a political party and selection/election of its office bearers is not similar to public employment. Whichever be the political party, one who is actively involved in the activities of that political party alone is ordinarily selected/elected as an office bearer. Having been selected as office bearer of the political party/DYFI before or soon after the appointment as non-hereditary trustees, respondent Nos.6 to 8 cannot contend that they were not active politicians. Not much deliberation is required in that regard in order to conclude that respondent Nos.6 and 7 were active politicians and respondent No.8 was an active worker of DYFI even at the time of their making applications for appointment as non-hereditary trustees and also appointment.” 
The court also held that the constitution of DYFI makes it evident that its activities are related to the area of politics. It cannot be said that its activities are non- political, the court noted.
"In such circumstances, we are of the view that respondent Nos.6 to 8 were disqualified to be appointed as non-hereditary trustees at the time of their making applications and appointment, on account of their involvement in active politics", the Court observed.
Only worshippers can be trustees
With regard to the alleged criminal antecedents of the trustees, the court observed that the condition prescribed in the notification was “persons who are convicted for more than six months for offences involving moral turpitude are alone ineligible to be non-hereditary trustees.” However, the same notification also specifically prescribes that persons applying for the post “shall be idol worshippers and persons having interest in the advancement of the Temple. They should also be persons used to be involved in the affairs of the Temple.” The court in this regard observed that “a person facing criminal prosecution for an offence involving moral turpitude cannot be considered a true worshipper of that standard required for a person to be appointed as a trustee in a Temple”. 
The court held that the respondents 6 to 8, due to their active involvement in politics were disqualified for appointment as non-hereditary trustees of the temple. The court also criticised the Malabar Devaswom Board for not enquiring into the background of the trustees before their appointment, including their criminal history and political activities. 
The court however, concluded that the petitioners did not avail other statutory remedies to address their grievance before filing the writ petition. It also noted that there was a long delay in approaching the court. The court refused to quash order appointing the trustees, on account of the expiry of their term as trustees on 20.02.2023. 
However, the court directed the Malabar Devaswom Board, to ensure that future appointments to the post of non-hereditary trustee in temples under its control be done strictly in accordance with the observations in the above matter and also in Chathu Achan v. State of Kerala [2022 (6) KLT 388] that had laid down similar guidelines.
Case Title: Anantha Narayanan & Others V Malabar Devaswom Board & Others 

The Delhi High Court has dismissed an appeal challenging the grant of recovery rights to an insurer against the registered owner of the car whose son was involved in a road accident leading to the death of a 42 year old man in 2013.
Justice Rekha Palli said the 42-year-old man lost his life only because the minor's father did not take appropriate steps to ensure that his vehicle is driven only by a person holding a valid driving licence.
"This Court, therefore, cannot condone such an act of the appellant and fasten the liability on the insurance company when it is evident that the terms of the insurance policy were breached by the appellant himself," the court said.
Justice Palli further observed that when the parents of minor children permit them to drive a motor vehicle, they not only put the lives of their own children in danger but also endanger the life of common citizens. 
"In the present case, the deceased Mr. Harinder Kumar, a young man of 42 years lost his life only because the appellant did not take appropriate steps to ensure that his vehicle is driven only by a person holding a valid driving licence”, the Court remarked," it added.
A Motor Accident Claims Tribunal in Rohini in November 2021 awarded a compensation of Rs.16,32,700 in favour of Kumar's wife and daughter. The tribunal in the order also said that the insurance company would have the right to recover the amount from the registered owner in appropriate proceedings as per law. It observed that that car owner by permitting his minor son to drive the vehicle, acted in breach of the terms of the insurance policy
Challenging the grant of recovery rights, the appellant contended that since the vehicle was driven by his minor son without his knowledge and permission, it could not be said that he had wilfully breached the terms of the insurance policy. He averred that at the time of the accident, he was in his office and his minor son had taken the keys of the car from his bedside drawer, which was inadvertently not locked at the relevant time.
 Referring to the award passed by the MACT, the court observed that the plea that his minor son had taken the car without his permission was not raised by the appellant/registered owner of the car either before the concerned police authority or the Juvenile Justice Board. 
 “Once the appellant, despite being aware that his son was a minor child, left the keys of his car at home and has failed to give any explanation as to why the keys of the car at home were left unattended when he himself was not there, the defence being taken by the appellant is apparently an afterthought in an attempt to somehow to escape his liability," the court observed. 
 The court added that the appellant did not lead any independent witness before the MACT in support of his plea that the car was driven by his minor son without his knowledge and permission.
 It thus upheld the award of the Tribunal and dismissed the appeal.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday (October 5, 2021) criticized the Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh for its failure to take action against advocates for filing fake claim petitions under Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and Workmen Compensation Act."It is very unfortunate that in such a serious matter, where the allegations are of filing of fake claim petitions in which the advocates are also alleged...
The Supreme Court on Tuesday (October 5, 2021) criticized the Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh for its failure to take action against advocates for filing fake claim petitions under Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and Workmen Compensation Act.
"It is very unfortunate that in such a serious matter, where the allegations are of filing of fake claim petitions in which the advocates are also alleged to have been involved, the Bar Council of U.P. is not giving instructions to their advocate. It shows the callousness and insensitiveness on the part of the Bar Council of U.P. Shri Manan Kumar Mishra, learned senior counsel and Chairman Bar Council of India to look into the same," bench of Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna noted in their order.
The Apex Court took note of the Supplementary affidavit dated September 30, 2021, filed on behalf of the UP Government, stating that the Special Investigation Team ("S.I.T.") was constituted pursuant to Allahabad High Court's order dated October 7, 2015.
In the affidavit, it was stated that ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Limited forwarded cases of suspicious claims related to various insurance companies forwarded by the learned District Judge, Raebareli, cases referred to the S.I.T. by various courts and the High Court of Allahabad, Lucknow Bench, cases of suspicious claims of Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and Workmen Compensation Act referred to by various Insurance Companies.
"The S.I.T. has received total 1376 complaints/cases of suspicious claims. It is stated that out of total 1376 cases of suspicious claims received by the Special Investigation Team, U.P., Lucknow, enquiry of 246 cases of suspicious claims has been completed till date and after having found prima facie offence of cognizable offence in nature against total 166 accused persons which includes petitioners/applicants, advocates, police personnel, doctors, insurance employees, vehicle owners, drivers etc. and total 83 criminal complaints have been registered in various districts. It is stated that the enquiry of remaining cases of suspicious claims is underway," the bench noted.
The division bench also took note of the submissions in the supplementary affidavit that out of total criminal complaints registered so far, an investigation of 33 criminal cases had been completed, and the legal process of submitting charge sheets against the accused persons was underway. Top Court further noted that the investigation in the remaining cases was in progress by the S.I.T.
Mentioning that the S.I.T. was constituted under Special Enquiry Headquarters, UP for conducting enquiry and investigation of the cases related to causing a loss in crores of rupees to the insurance companies by way of submitting fake claims under Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and Workmen Compensation Act as back from 2015, the bench said,
"Despite the same, the investigation/enquiry has not been completed till date and out of total 1376 cases of suspicious claims received by the Special Investigation Team, U.P., Lucknow, the enquiry has been completed only with respect to 246 cases of suspicious claims and only 83 criminal complaints have been registered in major districts."
Considering that even in those 33 criminal cases, the charge sheet had not been filed and that the legal process of submitting the charge sheet against the accused person was underway, the bench deprecated the manner and speed in which the enquiry was going.
The bench thereafter directed the State of UP/SIT to file an affidavit in a sealed cover with respect to complaints filed/enquiry completed, the names of the accused, where the criminal complaints are filed and in which criminal cases the charge sheets have been filed.
Observing that,
"It is the duty of the Bar Council of the State to take action against the advocates who are found to have been indulged in such unethical manner by filing the fake claims under the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and Workmen Compensation Act,"
Top Court further directed the State of UP/SIT to forward the name of the advocates against whom prima facie cases of cognizable offences are disclosed in a sealed cover till November 15, 2021, so that the same can be sent BCI for further action.
"It appears that Bar Council of State is not interested in taking action and, therefore, now the Bar Council of India has to step in and take appropriate action against the erring advocates, who are found to have indulged into the filing of such fake claims," bench further noted in its order.
The matter is now slated to be heard on November 16, 2021.
Case Title: Safiq Ahmad v ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. . & Ors.| Special Leave to Appeal (C) No. 1110/2017

Protest is a tool in the hands of the civil society and police action is a tool in the hands of the Establishment, the Supreme Court remarked in a recent judgment regarding a Kerala Panchayat election dispute.
The bench of Justices S. Abdul Nazeer and V. Ramasubramanian observed thus while allowing appeal filed by an elected candidate whose election was declared void on the ground that he failed to disclose his conviction under Kerala Police Act, 1960 for 'disobeying police directions' in relation to a dharna he had conducted.
Ravi Namboothiri was elected as Councilor of Ward No.5 of Annamanada Gram Panchayath, in the elections held in November­ 2015. The rival candidate filed an election petition before the District Munsif Court which got dismissed on a technical ground. The appeal filed against this order was allowed by Additional District Judge who declared the election as void on the ground that Namboodiri suppressed his involvement in a criminal case in the nomination form (Form 2A) and that therefore he had committed a corrupt practice. The Kerala High Court upheld this judgment.
In Appeal, the Apex court bench noticed that the offences for which the appellant was eventually convicted, were under Section 38 (Persons bound to conform to reasonable directions of police) read with Section 52 (Penalty for failure to conform to lawful and reasonable directions of police officers) of the Kerala Police Act, 1960 [Note: the 1960 Act was in force at the relevant time. Later, the Kerala Police Act, 2011 replaced it]. This was for the disobedience of the directions issued by a police officer in connection with a dharna which the appellant staged in front of the Panchayat office, along with a group of his supporters. 
Thus the issue considered was whether the non-­disclosure of the conviction for such offences would also come within the purview of Section 102(1)(ca) of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act. In this context, the bench observed: 
"While offences under the Indian Penal Code or under special enactments such as Prevention of Corruption Act, Arms Act and so on and so forth are substantive offences, the commission of which may make a person a criminal, an offence under certain enactments such as Kerala Police Act are not substantive offences. Just as strike is a weapon in the hands of the workmen and lock­out is a weapon in the hands of the employer under Labour Welfare legislations, protest is a tool in the hands of the civil society and police action is a tool in the hands of the Establishment. All State enactments such as Kerala Police Act, Madras Police Act etc., are aimed at better regulation of the police force and they do not create substantive offences. This is why these Acts themselves empower the police to issue necessary directions for the maintenance of law and order and the violation of any of those directions is made a punishable offence under these Acts."
The Court therefore held that the failure of a candidate to disclose his conviction for an offence under the Kerala Police Act 1960 for holding a dharna in front of the Panchayat office cannot be a ground for declaring his election void under Kerala Panchayat Raj Act. 
"Kerala Police Act, 1960 is actually the successor legislation of certain police enactments of the colonial era, whose object was to scuttle the democratic aspirations of the indigenous population. This aspect should be kept in mind before applying blindfold, the principle 'what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander'", the court remarked while allowing the appeal.

Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994 ; Section 52(1A) and 102(1) - Kerala Police Act, 1960 ; Sections 38 and 52 - The failure of the elected candidate to disclose (in nomination form) his conviction for an offence under the Kerala Police Act for holding a dharna in front of the Panchayat office, cannot be taken as a ground for declaring an election void.

(Para 45-47)
Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994 ; Section 102(1)(ca) - The failure to make a true disclosure in Form 2A, regarding the past conviction, will certainly come within the meaning of the word 'fake', mentioned in Section 102 (1)(ca) - A person having criminal antecedents, poses himself to be one without any such antecedent, when he fails to make a true disclosure. In law, he passes off or comes out as a person without any criminal antecedent. (Para 33)
Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994 ; Section 52(1A) - The words "involvement in a criminal case at the time of filing of the nomination" would only mean (i) cases where a criminal complaint is pending investigation/trial; (ii) cases where the conviction and/or sentence is current at the time of filing of the nomination; and (iii) cases where the conviction is the subject matter of any appeal or revision pending at the time of the nomination.

The Delhi High Court has observed that in case of internet trademark infringements, the intent of foreign seated defendants to target Indian customers and market must be established. 
Justice C Hari Shankar also observed that in such cases the interactivity should be coupled with an overt intent of the defendants to target customers in India.
"The operation of the Trademarks Act and the CPC statutorily extend only to the boundaries of India. In the case of internet infringements, no doubt, the decision of the Court may, at times,operate against entities located outside India. That, too, however, would be subject to existence of the necessary connection between the activity of the foreign-seated defendants and India. More specifically, intent, of the defendants, to target India, must be established," the Court said. 
Know The Controversy
The development came while the Court was dealing with a suit filed by Tata Sons Private Limited seeking permanent injunction restraining the defendants from using the trademark "TATA".
It was alleged that the defendants were using the said mark as part of the name under which their crypto currency was made available to the public on their website (www.hakunamatata.finance).
The question which thus arose in the matter was "whether the plaintiff can seek an injunction against the defendants' mark, the defendants being located outside the sovereign borders of India and, therefore, statutorily outside the reach of the Trademarks Act, 1999, as well as the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC)?"
What Did Tata Sons (Plaintiff) Argue?
It was the plaintiff's case that the defendant's website had 50 visitors from India each day and that India was second in the list of countries with highest internet traffic on the site. 
It was also argued that the Telegram page of Defendant indicated that it had several Indian followers or members.
According to Tata Sons, the availability of the defendants' crypto currency under the marks "TATA coin/$TATA" adversely affected it's business and resulted in dilution of its goodwill. 
Directions Can Only Be Issued Against Defendants Located Outside India If They Carry Infringing Acts Within Its Jurisdiction
The Court observed that where the defendants are located outside India, the Court can issue directions against such defendants, if they are carrying out their infringing activities within the jurisdiction of the Court.
"A somewhat more incisive approach is, however, required where the activity is carried out over the internet, as in the present case. A discernable line does exist, in such cases, between activities which would expose the defendants to the jurisdiction of this Court, and those which would not," the Court said. 
"Mere accessibility of the website of the overseas defendants, by persons located within the jurisdiction of this Court, is not sufficient to clothe this Court with jurisdiction to act against the defendants. Interactivity of the website is, in such a case, essential. The extent to which the website would be interactive is also, however, relevant; mere interactivity would not suffice," it added. 
Accessing Of Defendant's Website Cannot Constitute Ground For Court To Exercise Jurisdiction Over Defendants
The Court therefore was of the view that accessing of the webpage of Defendant in the suit cannot constitute a ground for the Court to exercise jurisdiction over the defendants. 
It was also observed that there was nothing to indicate that people had accessed the webpage from India.
"The mere fact that the defendants' crypto currency can be purchased by customers located in India and that, as a result, the plaintiff's brand value may be diluted, even seeing cumulatively, cannot, therefore, in my view, justify this Court interfering with the defendants' activities, or with its brand or mark. In fact, the very applicability of the "effect" doctrine across sovereign boundaries may itself be a matter for debate; I do not, however, propose to tread that path in the present case," the Court added. 
Observing that the Court cannot issue directions to the defendants for the reason of being outside it's territorial reach, the Court declined the prayer for interim relief. 
Title: TATA SONS PRIVATE LIMITED v. HAKUNAMATATA TATA FOUNDERS & ORS

Allowing a 17-year-old rape victim to get her pregnancy of 26 weeks terminated at a hospital, the Punjab and Haryana High Court recently observed that the child, if born, would be a reminder of trauma and agony for the minor.
Justice Vinod S. Bhardwaj in the ruling said, "As an unwanted child, the member is also likely to either live a tormenting life filled up with taunts to his origin or only to be given away. In either of the said situation, the mother as well as the child suffer social stigma and incarceration for rest of their lives."
The court added that such a situation would not be in the best interest of either the mother or her child as the minor's family has already expressed their unwillingness to take care of it. The unborn will grapple to come to terms with life and be subjected to maltreatment for no fault, it said.
"Such decisions are tough, however life is not just about being able to breathe - it is about being able to live with dignity. Where the denial of dignity and social as well as family acceptance or approval is a writing on the wall, it compounds agony of the child and lead to greater injustice. Balance thus needs to be drawn to examine the over all well being. Whether to shape the trauma of a victim or to prolong it by delivery of the child, who is to be only victimized. The choices thus reduce and it seems more prudent to allow the termination of pregnancy."
The victim had moved the High Court through her father with the petition seeking termination of pregnancy under the provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. The court was told that an FIR has been registered under Sections 363, 366-A, 376, 450 and 34 of the IPC along with Sections 4 and 17 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 in the matter. It was submitted that by the time the family or the minor became aware of the pregnancy, it had already exceeded around 21-22 weeks.
 The counsel representing the petitioner contended that since the pregnancy in question was more than 24-week old, the petitioner was statutorily required to approach the court for the termination under the MTP Act. It was the petitioner's contention that the girl being a minor herself is not in a position to take care of the child.
 The court perused the report submitted by a medical board which had earlier examined the victim. In the report, the doctors said that she was around 25 to 26 weeks pregnant. 
The board opined that since the victim was a minor, 'continuation of pregnancy may cause grave injury to her mental health'. While declaring her fit for termination of pregnancy, the board also warned that "termination of pregnancy around 25-26 weeks of gestation is associated with potential risk of medical and surgical complications as well as mental agony."
Justice Bhardwaj said there is no reason for the court to presume that the medical board's opinion is not in good faith and as to how the continuation of pregnancy would be in the larger interest of the minor.
 "The victim is a minor even as on date and is dependent on her family. She is yet to complete her education and pursue her goals in life. It can also not be lost sight of the fact that the pregnancy is an outcome of violation of the minor. It is a testimony to her bruised body and soul," said the court. 
 The court placed reliance on the Supreme Court's decision in X v. Union of India, (2020) 19 SCC 806, where the apex court had allowed termination of pregnancy of a 13-year old rape victim.
It directed the hospital in Mewat to take all appropriate and necessary steps needed to carry out the medical termination of the pregnancy of the minor upon satisfaction of all such necessary conditions as prescribed in law.
"The petitioner would be at liberty to espouse her financial status before the authorities concerned and be entitled to the benefit under the prevalent schemes in accordance with the rules," it added.
 Case Title: Mrs. X v. State of Haryana and Others 
 Coram: Justice Vinod S. Bhardwaj

The Supreme Court observed that if a court restricts the anticipatory bail upto framing of charge, the order should discuss the the peculiar facts and circumstances which warranted such restriction.
In this case, the Allahabad High Court restricted the anticipatory bail granted to the accused only till framing of the charge. 
In response to the Special Leave Petition filed by the accused, ASG KM Nataraj justifying the order by relying on a decision in Nathu Singh vs. State of Uttar Pradesh 2021 (6) SCC 64. In the said decision, it was held that though normally, the anticipatory bail should not be granted for a specific period, if the facts and circumstances are so made out, the Court can limit the tenure of the anticipatory bail. ASG requested time to file counter affidavit so as to substantiate the reasons for limiting the period of anticipatory bail. 
"We are not inclined to grant time to file reply in as much as the counter affidavit cannot supplement the reasons given in the impugned order. It is the impugned order which would reflect the mind of the judge as to what were the peculiar facts and circumstances which warranted limiting the anticipatory bail for a particular period. The perusal of the entire order would reveal that there is no discussion at all with regard to the same.", the court observed.
The court therefore quashed the part of the impugned order which restricts the anticipatory bail upto framing of charge.

The Jharkhand High Court on Wednesday directed the State's Director General of Police to take suitable steps to ensure that innocent persons, against whom there are no materials, are not harassed and their liberty is not infringed or curtailed at the whim of the investigating officers.
This direction came from the Bench of Justice Ananda Sen while awarding a compensation of Rs. 50,000/- to a tribal man as it found that he was made an accused in an Abetment of suicide case and was kept in custody for no fault on his part.
The case in brief 
The case was dealing with the case of one Sanichar Kol/Petitioner who was charged under Section 306 of IPC and was in custody since July 1, 2021. He moved to the High Court seeking regular bail in the matter after his bail plea was rejected by the lower court.
Essentially, the petitioner was booked for abetment of suicide of a lady named Asha Devi, aged about 36 years, who was allegedly murdered in her matrimonial home by her husband.
 The basis of impleading the petitioner in the case was the information given by the sister of the deceased to the informant (father of the deceased) that when she had reached the scene of the crime to see her sister's dead body, she had also seen Petitioner sitting beside the dead body of the deceased.
On the basis of this information, the informant had concluded and alleged that her daughter Asha Devi was done to death by her husband Govind Mandal, her brother-in-law Naresh Mandal and this petitioner.
Court's observations
Taking into account the facts and circumstances of the case and after perusing the case diary, the Court observed that there was no overt act committed by this petitioner, that could attract any ingredients of an offence, which is punishable under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code.
Stressing that the only act of the petitioner was that he was sitting beside the dead body, the Court remarked thus:
"This petitioner, admittedly, is a neighbour, who, on the call of husband of the deceased, rushed to the place of occurrence and found the dead body of the deceased hanging and it is this petitioner and the husband of the deceased, who brought the dead body down from the hanging state and laid it on the cot. This action of the petitioner cannot be said to be an action that constitutes an offence, as he had fulfilled his obligation as a neighbour...That being so, this Court was really astonished as to how this petitioner was charge-sheeted for an offence punishable under Sections 306/34 of the Indian Penal Code and how he was taken in custody."
The Court further observed that the petitioner was made to suffer for answering a call of humanity and that his liberty was not only threatened but was taken away by the State, whimsically, without there being any material against him.
In view of this, the Court, at the outset, CONFIRMED April 1, 2022, interim order of the release of the petitioner on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs.1/- and thereafter, it HELD that the petitioner was ENTITLED to receive a compensation amount of Rs.50,000/- to be paid by the State.
The Court also thought of converting the instant case filed seeking regular bail to a 482 CrPC plea and quashing the entire criminal proceedings, however, keeping in view the judicial propriety, as the Chief Justice, who is the Master of Roster, had not assigned the Bench to hear an application under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court refrained from exercising that jurisdiction.
However, the Court, without invoking the said jurisdiction, CONVERTED the instant bail application to one under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and directed it to be listed immediately before an appropriate Bench with the leave of the Chief Justice.
Further, before parting with the order, the Court also added a note for the Judicial Officers that while dealing with bail applications, they should be cautious and should not pass mechanical orders rejecting bail applications when there are no materials against the persons seeking bail and also observed thus:
"The suffering of the petitioner could have easily been minimized if the Principal Sessions Judge, Jamtara would not have dismissed the bail application in a mechanical manner without appreciating the materials available in the case diary. Be it noted that the decision to file chargesheet under Sections 306/34 of the Indian Penal Code was taken before the Principal Sessions Judge, Jamtara dismissed the bail application of the petitioner."
With this observation, the Court directed that the copy of the entire brief alongwith the case diary and the orders of the Court be transmitted to the Judicial Academy, Jharkhand for giving appropriate training to the Judicial Officers in dealing with these types of cases.
Advocate Kaushal Kishor Mishra appeared for the Petitioner. A.A.G. II Sachin Kumar and APP Ashok Singh appeared for the state.

The Kerala High Court recently ruled that one cannot prefer an appeal under provide to Section 372 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against a trial court's order, challenging the adequacy of sentence imposed upon the convict.
Observing so, a Division Bench of Justice K. Vinod Chandran and C. Jayachandran dismissed a criminal appeal adding that such an appeal can only be preferred by the State under Section 377 of CrPC.
"It is significant to note that no appeal is provided from an Order challenging the inadequacy of sentence. The right to prefer an appeal on the ground of inadequacy of sentence is conferred upon the State Government by virtue of Section 377 of the Code of Criminal Procedure."
The appeal was preferred against the judgment of the Special Court for Trial of Offences Against Children as per which, the accused (respondents herein) were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment and fine under several provisions of the Indian Penal Code.
 Arguing that the punishment imposed is grossly inadequate considering the gravity of the offences, the appellant (victim) sought enhancement of punishment before the High Court by way of a criminal appeal. 
Public Prosecutor V.S. Sreejith pointed out that the proviso to Section 372 CrPC does not envisage an appeal against an order imposing an inadequate sentence and argued that this power was statutorily vested with the State Government as per Section 377.
However, Advocates C.M. Mohammed Iquabal and P.C. Noushad appearing for the appellant argued that the appeal is maintainable since the proviso to Section 372 contemplates an appeal against an order imposing inadequate compensation, which expression takes within its sweep, an order imposing inadequate sentence as well.
According to them, the scope of an appeal should not be restricted to cases where the punishment is for a lesser offence more so when the 'Notes on Clauses' to the CrPC (Amendment) Bill, 2006 stipulates that the amendment to Section 372 gives the victim the right to prefer an appeal against any adverse order passed by the trial court.
The Court after perusing the impugned Section noted that a victim can appeal against three types of orders: 
(i) order acquitting the accused; 
 (ii) order convicting the accused for a lesser offence; and
(iii) order imposing inadequate compensation
The Court noted that there is no vested right to prefer an appeal unless conferred by statute, which legal position is recognised in Section 372, wherein it is stipulated that no appeal shall lie from any order of a Criminal Court, except as provided for by the CrPC any other law for the time being in force.
Moreover, going through a series of precedents and authoritative pronouncements by the Apex Court, the Bench refused to take stock of the argument of the appellant based on the 'Notes on Clauses' to the CrPC (Amendment) Bill.
Therefore, the appeal was dismissed by the Court with a finding that it was not maintainable.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court (Gwalior Bench) on Monday directed the Principal Secretary, Law and Legislative Affairs/District Magistrate, Bhind to conduct an inquiry against a Public Prosecutor who gave up an 'important' eye witness/father of the deceased in a murder trial.
The Bench of Justice G. S. Ahluwalia has also directed the Public Prosecutor, Bhind to withdraw all the Sessions Trial involving offence under Sections 302, 307, 376/POCSO Act and all other important matters from the said Public Prosecutor Till the inquiry report is received.
This order came from the Court while hearing a regular bail plea filed by a Murder accused on the ground that since four eyewitnesses have been examined and they have not supported the prosecution case, he shall be released on bail.
The matter in brief 
Essentially, on October 5, 2021, the Co-ordinate Bench had expressed its surprise to note that the trial court had, in the instant case, given up two eyewitnesses namely Hariom and Sarnam Singh (father of the deceased who is an eye witness) on the request of Public Prosecutor.
Accordingly, the Public Prosecutor, named Sanjay Kumar Sharma was directed to submit his affidavit for explaining the reason for giving up the said eyewitnesses.
In his affidavit, he submitted that since Sarnam Singh (father of the deceased who is an eye witness) and Hariom were not supporting the prosecution case, therefore, in order to save precious time of the Court, these two witnesses were given up.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court observed that it was nowhere mentioned in the affidavit that Hariom and Sarnam Singh had ever contacted him (Sanjay Kumar Sharma) to inform that they would not support the prosecution case.
Apart from this, the Court also observed that another witness had not supported the prosecution case, but the same witness was not given up by the Public Prosecutor by applying the same analogy
"How Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma was knowing that these witnesses (Hariom and Sarnam Singh) would not support the prosecution case is also a mystery," the Court further observed.
In this backdrop, the Court remarked thus:
"It is clear that Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma has arbitrarily given up Sarnam Singh who is the father of the deceased and an eye witness as well as Hariom. However, this Court is refraining itself from mentioning anything further but one thing is clear that Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma has lost the confidence."
Accordingly, the Court directed as under:-
The Public Prosecutor, Bhind shall immediately withdraw file of this case from Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma and Public Prosecutor shall himself conduct trial and Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma is directed to stay away from this case. The Principal Secretary, Law and Legislative Affairs/District Magistrate, Bhind (whosoever is the competent authority) is directed to conduct an enquiry against Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma and decide as to whether his continuation on the post of APP is desirable or not (within 2 months). The Public Prosecutor shall immediately file an application under Section 311 of Cr.P.C for seeking permission to examine Hariom and Sarnam Singh. Since this Court has already come to a conclusion that Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma APP has wrongly given up these witnesses, therefore, the trial Court shall consider and decide the same after considering the importance of the witnesses.
So far as the present bail application was concerned, noting the allegations that the applicant and his son Ashok had fired causing the death of the deceased, Sarnam Singh (an eye witness), the Court dismissed his bail plea.

The Aurangabad Bench of Bombay High Court has held that an amendment to the application under Section 34 of the A&C Act would not be allowed if it leads to absolutely new grounds to challenge the award.
 The Single Bench of Justice Mangesh S. Patil held that in an appropriate case it is permissible to allow the amendment to application under Section 34 even beyond the period provided under Section 34(3) of the Act, however, the amendment can only add some facts to the pending challenge but it cannot be allowed if it constitutes a fresh challenge.
 The Court further held that the benefit of the decision of the Supreme Court in Ellora Paper Mills Limited Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh (2022) 3 SCC 1, wherein the Supreme Court held that Section 12(5) would also apply to pending arbitration that commenced before the 2015 Amendment Act, would not be available to a party if it failed to raise the objection regarding neutrality before the passing of the arbitral award. 
 Facts
 Pursuant to an arbitration between the parties, an award was passed on 31.03.2018. Aggrieved by the award, the petitioner filed application on 26.06.2018. The respondent simultaneously filed for the enforcement of the award. 
 Thereafter, after a lapse of two years, the petitioner preferred an application for amendment to its application under Section 34 of the Act on the ground that some important legal points were not taken in the original application and for a stay on the execution of the award. The District Judge dismissed the applications preferred by the petitioner. 
 Aggrieved by the decision of the District Court, the petitioner preferred a writ petition against the impugned order. 
 Grounds of Challenge
 The provision of Section 12(5) of the A&C Act would also apply to pending arbitration as on the date of amendment; therefore, the petitioner via the proposed amendment is raising the ground regarding the neutrality of arbitrator. Reliance was placed on the decision on Ellora Paper Mills Limited Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh; (2022) 3 Supreme Court Cases 1.The petitioner is also raising an additional ground of fraud which goes to the root of the legality of the award, therefore, the District Court erred in rejecting the application of the petitioner. The District Court also erred in refusing to entertain the application of the petitioner for stay on the award. 
 The respondent countered the submission of the petitioner on the following grounds:
 Absolutely new grounds to challenge the award in a pending proceeding under Section 34 were being sought to be inserted by way of the proposed amendment and the same is impermissible.There was no foundation for the newly proposed grounds as those objections were never raised either before the arbitrator or in the original petition. 
 Analysis by the Court
 The Court held that that by way of the proposed amendment the grounds which are now being sought to be inserted have absolutely no foundation in the petitioner's application preferred under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.
 The Court held that in an appropriate case it is permissible to allow amendment to application under Section 34 even beyond the period provided under Section 34(3) of the Act, however, the amendment can only add some facts to the pending challenge but it cannot be allowed if it constitutes a fresh challenge. 
 The Court observed that the ground of neutrality of the arbitrator and fraud were being sought to be raised for the first time by way of the proposed amendment and the petitioner at no point in time raised such objections under Section 12, 13 or 14 of the Act. 
 The Court further held that the benefit of the decision of the Supreme Court in Ellora Paper Mills Limited Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh (2022) 3 SCC 1, wherein the Supreme Court held that Section 12(5) would also apply to pending arbitration that commenced before the 2015 Amendment Act, would not available to a party if it failed to raise the objection regarding neutrality before the passing of the arbitral award. 
 However, the Court held that the District Court erred in refusing to entertain the application for stay on the award on the wrong assumption that by way of such application the interim relief/stay has been sought only till the decision on the amendment application whereby the petitioner had prayed for amendment of the application, when the prayer in the application clearly shows that the petitioner was seeking stay to the execution of the award till the decision of the arbitration application. The Court directed the District Court to consider the application for a stay afresh. 
 Accordingly, the Court party allowed the application.

The Allahabad High Court recently observed that in the event of any failure on the part of any person to comply with a Court's order to pay maintenance allowance, the correct/appropriate course for the courts is to first issue a warrant for the levy of fine as provided u/s 421 of CrPC for the purpose of realization of the amount.
With this, the bench of Justice Ajit Singh held that in such cases of non-payment of maintenance allowance, the Magistrate has no jurisdiction to issue a warrant of arrest straightway against the person liable, without first levying the amount due as a fine as provided under Section 421 of CrPC.
The case in brief 
The wife of the applicant, along with her daughter filed an application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. before the Family Court, Kasganj seeking maintenance from the applicant-husband. The application was allowed.
However, the applicant being a handicapped person failed to comply with the order and hence, the Court issued a recovery warrant directing him to pay a sum of Rs. 1,65,000/- to the opposite party no. 2 as maintenance w.e.f. July 30, 2017, to January 19, 2020, and in pursuance of the recovery warrant, the applicant was sent to jail vide order dated 30 November 2021.
Challenging that very order passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Kasganj, the Applicant-husband moved to the High Court with his 482 CrPC plea.
Before the Court, his counsel argued that the provisions of Section 125(3) Cr.P.C. specifically provides for the issuance of a warrant for levying the amount issued in the manner provided for levying of fines (the procedure for the same is provided under Section 421 of CrPC). 
It was further submitted that the Court below passed an order on November 30, 2021, for the detention of the applicant in jail for one month without complying with the provision contained in Section 125(3) Cr.P.C. and without imposing any fine, hence, it was contended that the impugned order was liable to be quashed.
Court's observations and order
At the outset, the Court observed that as per sub-section (3) of Section 125 Cr.P.C., in the event of any failure on the part of any person to comply with an order to pay maintenance allowance, without sufficient cause, the Magistrate is empowered to issue a warrant for levying the amount due in manner provided for levying of fines for every breach of the order.
In this regard, the Court further noted that Section 421Cr.P.C. prescribes the manner for levying fines and clause (a) of sub-Section (1) of Section 421 provides for the issuance of a warrant for the levy of the amount by attachment and sale of any movable property belonging to the offender.
In other words, the Court clarified, in the event of any failure without sufficient cause to comply with the order for maintenance allowance, the Magistrate is empowered to issue a distress warrant for the purpose of realization of the amount, in respect of which default has been made, by attachment and sale of any movable property, that may be seized in execution of such warrant (as per the provisions of Section 421 of CrPC). 
Against this backdrop, the Court categorically held thus:
"The Magistrate has no jurisdiction to issue a warrant of arrest straightway against the person liable for payment of maintenance allowance in the event of non-payment of maintenance allowance within the time fixed by the court without first levying the amount due as fine and without making any attempt for reaslization that fine in one or both the modes for recovery of that fine as provided for in clauses (a) or (b) of sub-Section (1) of Section 421 Cr.P.C. say by issuance of distress warrant for attachment and sale of movable property belonging to the defaulter as contemplated under Section 421 (1) (a) and without first sentencing the defaulter to imprisonment after the execution of the distress warrant."
In view of the aforesaid, this Court concluded that the Principal Judge, Family Court, Kasganj had not followed the established procedure for issuance of recovery warrant in default of payment of arrears maintenance allowance within the time allowed by him in the execution case concerned. therefore, the order was set aside.

Election and voting processes stand threatened by social media manipulation, the Supreme Court remarked in the judgment delivered on Thursday in Facebook vs. Delhi Assembly case.
Entities like Facebook have to remain accountable to those who entrust them with such power. While Facebook has played a crucial role in enabling free speech by providing a voice to the voiceless and a means to escape state censorship, we cannot lose sight of the fact that it has simultaneously become a platform for disruptive messages, voices, and ideologies.", the bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul noted.
To illustrate this, the Court pointed out the 2016 US Presidential elections controversy about supposed interference by Russia allegedly facilitated by platforms like Facebook. 
As a Prolegomenon to the judgment, the bench also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy said that the Facebook is the most popular social media platform in India with about 270 million registered users. The court made the following observations:
Entities like Facebook have to remain accountable to those who entrust them with such power
Such vast powers must necessarily come with responsibility. Entities like Facebook have to remain accountable to those who entrust them with such power. While Facebook has played a crucial role in enabling free speech by providing a voice to the voiceless and a means to escape state censorship, we cannot lose sight of the fact that it has simultaneously become a platform for disruptive messages, voices, and ideologies. The successful functioning of a liberal democracy can only be ensured when citizens are able to make informed decisions. Such decisions have to be made keeping in mind a plurality of perspectives and ideas. The information explosion in the digital age is capable of creating new challenges that are insidiously modulating the debate on issues where opinions can be vastly divided. Thus, while social media, on the one hand, is enhancing equal and open dialogue between citizens and policy makers; on the other hand, it has become a tool in the hands of various interest groups who haveSuch vast powers must necessarily come with responsibility. Entities like Facebook have to remain accountable to those who entrust them with such power. 
Facebook has simultaneously become a platform for disruptive messages, voices, and ideologies.
While Facebook has played a crucial role in enabling free speech by providing a voice to the voiceless and a means to escape state censorship, we cannot lose sight of the fact that it has simultaneously become a platform for disruptive messages, voices, and ideologies. The successful functioning of a liberal democracy can only be ensured when citizens are able to make informed decisions. Such decisions have to be made keeping in mind a plurality of perspectives and ideas. The information explosion in the digital age is capable of creating new challenges that are insidiously modulating the debate on issues where opinions can be vastly divided. Thus, while social media, on the one hand, is enhancing equal and open dialogue between citizens and policy makers; on the other hand, it has become a tool in the hands of various interest groups who have recognised its disruptive potential. This results in a paradoxical outcome where extremist views are peddled into the mainstream, thereby spreading misinformation. Established independent democracies are seeing the effect of such ripples across the globe and are concerned. Election and voting processes, the very foundation of a democratic government, stand threatened by social media manipulation. This has given rise to significant debates about the increasing concentration of power in platforms like Facebook, more so as they are said to employ business models that are privacy-intrusive and attention soliciting.The effect on a stable society can be cataclysmic with citizens being 'polarized and parlayzed' by such "debates", dividing the society vertically. Less informed individuals might have a tendency to not verify information sourced from friends, or to treat information received from populist leaders as the gospel truth. 
The court also noted that the countries like Australia, US, the UK, and the EU have made efforts to regulate platforms such as Facebook in an efficient manner b
"...But their efforts are still at a nascent stage as studies are undertaken to understand the dynamism of the platform and its disruptive potential. A recent example has been Australia's effort to formulate a legislation that would require Facebook to pay publishers for using their news stories. The law was seen as a tool to regulate the platform's unchecked influence over political discourse, society, and democracy. In response, Facebook blocked all news on its platform across the country with the result that there was some relaxation but ultimately a via media was found. The US has also seen heated debates arising from the 2016 Presidential elections with allegations of supposed interference by Russia allegedly facilitated by platforms like Facebook. Last year, the EU formulated legislative proposals namely the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, setting out rules for platforms to follow.", the bench said.

The Supreme Court has commuted the death sentence awarded to a man accused of rape and murder of four year old girl.
The bench comprising Justices UU Lalit, S. Ravindra Bhat and Bela M. Trivedi observed that the maximum punishment prescribed may not always be the determinative factor for repairing the crippled psyche of the offender.
The Trial Court had awarded death sentence to the accused Firoz for the offence under section 302 of IPC and directed to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 07 years and pay fine of Rs. 2000/- for the offence under section 363, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years and pay fine of Rs. 2000/- for the offence under section 366 of IPC, to undergo life imprisonment and pay fine of Rs. 2000/- for the offences under sections 376(2)(i), 376(2)(m) of IPC and under sections 5(i)r/w 6 & 5(m) r/w 6 of POCSO Act. The High Court dismissed his appeal and confirmed the death sentence.
In appeal, re-appreciating the evidence on record, the Apex Court bench held that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt all the circumstances individually and also proved the circumstances forming a chain, so conclusive as to rule out the possibility of any other hypothesis except the guilt of the accused.
Regarding the death sentence awarded for murder, the bench made the following observation:
"While affirming the view taken by the courts below with regard to the conviction of the appellant for the offences charged against him, deem it proper to commute, and accordingly commute the sentence of death for the sentence of imprisonment for life, for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC. Since, Section 376A IPC is also applicable to the facts of the case, considering the gravity and seriousness of the offence, the sentence of imprisonment for the remainder of appellant's natural life would have been an appropriate sentence, however, we are reminded of what Oscar Wilde has said - "The only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past and every sinner has a future". One of the basic principles of restorative justice as developed by this Court over the years, also is to give an opportunity to the offender to repair the damage caused, and to become a socially useful individual, when he is released from the jail. The maximum punishment prescribed may not always be the determinative factor for repairing the crippled psyche of the offender. Hence, while balancing the scales of retributive justice and restorative justice, we deem it appropriate to impose upon the appellant-accused, the sentence of imprisonment for a period of twenty years instead of imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life for the offence under section 376A, IPC. The conviction and sentence recorded by the courts below for the other offences under IPC and POCSO Act are affirmed. It is needless to say that all the punishments imposed shall run concurrently."

Criminal Trial - Sentencing - Restorative justice - To give opportunity to the offender to repair the damage caused, and to become a socially useful individual, when he is released from the jail - The maximum punishment prescribed may not always be the determinative factor for repairing the crippled psyche of the offender. (Para 43)
Criminal Trial - The court conducting the trial/appeal is not only obliged to protect the rights of the accused but also the rights of the victim, and the interest of the society at large. The Judge presiding over the criminal trial has not only to see that innocent man is not punished but has also to see that guilty man does not escape. Both are his public duties required to be discharged very diligently to maintain the public confidence and uphold the majesty of the law. (Para 35)

The Andhra Pradesh High Court has recently reiterated that impounding of a passport cannot be done by the Court under Section 104 CrPC even when a criminal case is pending.
 The criminal petition was filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal procedure seeking to quash the order of the Court of Principal Sessions Judge and to return the passport of the petitioner to allow him to travel to USA after its renewal.
 The Petitioner submitted that he scrupulously complied with the conditions imposed and did not misuse the liberty granted permitting the petitioner to travel abroad.
 The Petitioner submitted that the passport was due for renewal and the petitioner intended to visit his daughter after her delivery, who was residing in USA, therefore, sought for temporary return of the passport for six months.
 The counsel relied on the decision passed by the Apex Court in Suresh Nand v. CBI (2008) wherein it was observed that impounding of a passport cannot be done by the Court under Section 104 CrPC though it can impound any other document or thing. Moreover, the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Crl. P. No. 1954 of 2020 following the ratio in the aforementioned Supreme Court case held that neither the Police nor the Courts have the power to seize the passport or to direct the accused to deposit or surrender the passport even when a criminal case is pending in the court and only the Passport Officer is the Competent authority to impound the passport.
 Justice D. Ramesh, considering the law laid down, allowed the Criminal Petition and directed that the petitioner be returned the passport for a period of six months.
The Karnataka High Court also stated the same proposition in a recent judgment.
Case Title: Ravi Ramesh Babu Versus The State Of Andhra Pradesh

While allowing the development works carried by Odisha Government near the historic Puri Jagannath Temple, the Supreme Court held that construction of essential facilities like toilets, water supply etc., are permissible within the prohibited area near a protected monument.
The Court held that the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act(AMASR Act), 1958 does not absolutely bar such construction activities within the 100 meter prohibited area from a protected monument(Ardhendu Kumar Das vs State of Odisha).
According to Section 20A of the Act, area within the radius of 100 meters from the protected monument is declared as "prohibited area".
As per Section 20A(3), the Central Government or Director General can permit public works essential for public interest in prohibited area.
Section 20A(4) states that no permission, referred to in sub­ section (3), including carrying out any public work or project essential to the public or other constructions, shall be granted in any prohibited area after the date on which the 2010 Amendment to the AMASR Act received Presidential assent.
Relying on Section 20A(4), the petitioners argued that the construction of toilets etc by the State Government in the prohibited area of Jagannath Temple premises was illegal.
The Advocate General of Odisha argued that works like construction of toilets, drainages etc., are exempted from the definition of "construction" under Section 2(dc) of the Act.
The bench comprising Justices BR Gavai and Hima Kohli noted that the definition of "construction" specifically excludes the following:
(i) Re­construction, repair and renovation of an existing structure or building;
(ii) Construction, maintenance and cleansing of drains and drainage works and of public latrines, urinals and similar conveniences;
(iii) Construction and maintenance of works meant for providing supply of water for public; and
(iv) Construction or maintenance, extension, management for supply and distribution of electricity to the public or provision for similar facilities for public.
The bench also noted that Sections 20C and 20D of the Act permits construction, repair, renovation etc in the prohibited area with the permission of the authority. In the instant case, the National Monument Authority has given permission for the construction activities.
The Court said that though the argument of the petitioner by relying on Section 20A(4) is attractive in first blush, the provision has to be read harmoniously with other provisions.
"At first blush, the arguments of the appellants on the basis of sub­section (4) of Section 20A of the said Act may appear to be attractive. But when sub­section (4) of Section 20A of the said Act is read in harmony with clause (dc) of Section 2 and the provisions of Sections 20C and 20D of the said Act, we find that the submission that no construction at all can be made in the prohibited area or the regulated area, would be unsustainable".
"Firstly, it is to be noted that clause (dc) of Section 2 of the said Act itself excludes four categories as mentioned hereinabove from the definition of "construction". The legislative intent is thus clear that the four categories which are excluded from the definition of "construction" as defined in clause (dc) of Section 2 of the said Act would not be treated as a "construction", wherever the said term is referred to in the statute. The legislative intent is clear that the re­construction,repair, renovation of the existing buildings has been excluded from the definition. Similarly, the construction, maintenance etc. of drains, drainage works, public latrines and urinals; the construction and maintenance of works meant for providing supply of water to public; and construction etc. for distribution of electricity, which could be construed to be essential services for catering to the needs of the public at large, have consciously been kept out of the definition of "construction". It could be presumed that the legislature was aware that repairs and reconstruction of existing structures or buildings or construction of essential facilities like public latrines, urinals, water supply and electricity distribution for the pilgrims/residents are basic necessities and as such, should be permitted even in the prohibited area. If it is not so interpreted, then Section 20C of the said Act would be rendered otiose and redundant. It need not be emphasized that an interpretation which leads a particular provision to be otiose or redundant or meaningless, has to be avoided". 
Also, the need for toilets in the area was taken note of by the Supreme Court in the case Mrinalini Padhi vs. Union of India and others in which detailed directions were issued for the administration of the Jahgannath Temple. In that case, the Court had emphasized on the necessity to have separate toilets for male and female. The Court further directed that the toilets be provided with modern amenities and should be kept absolutely clean. The Court also directed that the number of toilets shall be adequate having regard to the average footfall in the Temple.
In this backdrop, the bench observed :
"The construction is being carried out for the purpose of providing basic and essential amenities like toilets for men and women, cloak rooms, electricity rooms etc. These are the basic facilities which are necessary for the convenience of the devotees at large. As already discussed hereinabove, the legislative intent appears to be clear. The legislature has deliberately excluded four categories from the definition of "construction". The purpose behind it appears to be that the repairs and renovation of the buildings, which are existing and the constructions which are necessary for providing basic facilities like drainage, toilets, water supply and distribution of electricity should be kept out of the rigour of requirement of statutory permissions:"
The petitioner raised an argument that such permission can be given only to an individual residing in the area for construction or renovation of an existing structure and not for the State to provide facilities for the public.
The bench rejected this argument as :
"If an individual person can construct a toilet in a prohibited area; can the State be denied to do so, when the State finds it necessary to do it in the larger public interest for providing basic facilities to the lakhs of devotees visiting the shrine? The answer is an emphatic 'no'".

Interpretation of Statutes - It is a settled principle of law that all the provisions in the statute have to be read harmoniously. It is presumed that each and every provision has been brought by the legislature into the statute book with some purpose. A particular provision cannot be read in isolation and has to be read in context to each other. An attempt has to be made to reconcile all the provisions of the statute together, unless it is impossible (Para 40)
Public Interest Litigation - Frivolous PILs should be nipped in the bud - In the recent past, it is noticed that there is mushroom growth of public interest litigations. However, in many of such petitions, there is no public interest involved at all. The petitions are either publicity interest litigations or personal interest litigation. We highly deprecate practice of filing such frivolous petitions. They are nothing but abuse of process of law. They encroach upon a valuable judicial time which could be otherwise utilized for considering genuine issues. It is high time that such so­called public interest litigations are nipped in the bud so that the developmental activities in the larger public interest are not stalled (Para 59)

The Patna High Court on Monday observed that in absence of any connection between the act alleged and the property recovered under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, it cannot be assumed that those properties were acquired by the terrorist act. 
The observation came by a single judge bench comprising of Justice Birendra Kumar while dealing with a petition filed by the family members of an accused person challenging the order of Designated Authority allowing ex post approval under sec. 25 of UAPA with regards to seizure of certain properties which were not connected with the acts so alleged against the accused. 
About the Case 
The timeline of the case dates back to the year 2012 wherein a case was registered under sec. 414 of Indian Penal Code, sec. 10 and 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and sec. (1-AA)/(1-AAA), 26 (2) and 35 of the Arms Act. 
It was the case of the prosecution that the accused Kundan Mundal along with other persons were reported to supply arms and explosives to Naxals. The police then noticed a vehicle entering into the lane wherein three persons from the vehicle managed to flee after seeing them. 
However, nothing was recovered from the physical possession of the arrested persons but a pistol along with other accessories was recovered for which the accused could not show any paper. The police also seized some Naxal literature from the vehicle which the arrested persons later disclosed that they used to supply arms to the naxals. 
When the police searched the house of Mandal the very next day i.e. 26th July 2012, certain items including laptop, cash, ATM cards, Pan cards etc were seized. Subsequently a third seizure was made in the case on 26th August 2012. 
Letters were written dated 21st August 2012 by IO and Superintendent of Police seeking ex post approval of the seizure from a designated authority under sec. 25 of UAPA which requires a prior approval of DGP by IO making seizure. 
The order dated 17th October 2012 by the Designated Authority cum Principal Secretary, Government of Bihar vide which the seizure was confirmed was challenged before the Sessions Judge wherein the Court dismissed the appeal on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal against the order of designated authority. Therefore, being aggrieved, the petitioners challenged the order before the High Court. 
Observations of the Court
The Court observed that while it was evident that the IO could exercise the power of seizure only if the offence under Chapter IV of the UAPA Act appears to have been committed, the Court held that no such offence was alleged against the accused person in the matter. Therefore, the exercise entered into by the IO in making seizure of property was wholly illegal and without jurisdiction. 
"Section 25 of the UAP Act requires that the Investigating Officer must have "reason to believe" that any property in relation to which an investigation is being conducted represents "proceeds of terrorism". "The reason to believe" must be on the basis of specific, reliable and relevant information."  The Court observed at the outset. 
In view of this, the Court observed that the police report submitted did not show any specific reliable or relevant information to form a believe that the property so seized were "proceeds of terrorism". 
"In absence of any connection between the act alleged and the property recovered, it cannot be assumed that those properties were acquired by the terrorist act." The Court held. 
The Court observed thus: 
"To attract the mischief of penalty for being member of an unlawful association under Section 10 of the UAP Act, it must be established that the association was declared unlawful by a notification issued under Section 3 of the UAP Act. In the case on hand, there is no evidence that to which of the unlawful association the accused were supplying the arms. Hence, it cannot be ascertained whether that association was declared unlawful association or not. Likewise, Section 13 of the UAP Act which provides punishment for unlawful activities is, prima facie, not attracted in absence of identity of the unlawful association." 
Therefore, the Court set aside the seizure exercise, order of its confirmation and order of the lower appellate court and ordered the release of the seized property in favor of the petitioners within 10 days failing to which Rs. 10,000 compensation would have to be paid to the petitioners for each delay.

The Allahabad High Court has recently observed that a Magistrate can take cognizance of the complaint or application filed by the aggrieved person and issue notice to the respondent under Section 12 of the D.V. Act even in the absence of a Domestic Incident Report (DIR).
The bench of Justice Rajeev Singh referred to the recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the case of Prabha Tyagi vs Kamlesh Devi  (SC) 474, wherein it was held that Section 12 of the DV Act does not make it mandatory for a Magistrate to consider a Domestic Incident Report filed by a Protection Officer or service provider before passing any order under the D.V. Act.
In essence, the Apex Court had in Prabha Tyagi (Supra) clarified that even in the absence of a Domestic Incident Report, a Magistrate is empowered to pass both ex parte or interim as well as a final order under the provisions of the D.V. Act.

What is a Domestic Incident Report?
Before we move ahead to understand what the court held in this case, let us first understand what does a Domestic Incident Report (DIR) mean? A Domestic Incident Report is a report made in the prescribed form on receipt of a complaint of domestic violence from an aggrieved person.
It may be noted that as per Section 12 of the DV Act, an aggrieved person or a Protection Officer or any other person on behalf of the aggrieved person including the service provider may present an application to the Magistrate seeking one or more 58 reliefs under the D.V. Act. 
Further, the proviso to Sub-Section (1) of Section 12 states that before passing any order on such an application, the Magistrate shall take into consideration any Domestic Incident Report received by him from the Protection Officer or the service provider
Now, it must be understood that such a report comes into the picture only when a Protection Officer or any other person on behalf of the aggrieved person including the service provider presents an application to the Magistrate. 
But what happens when an aggrieved person herself approaches a magistrate u/s 12 of DV Act and does not approach the magistrate through the Protection Officer or a service provider? Now, in such a case, naturally, there wouldn't be any Domestic Incident Report (DIR) in existence.
In such a situation, can it be said that in the absence of a Domestic Incident Report, the Magistrate cannot pass any order under the D.V. Act particularly when an application is filed before the Magistrate by the aggrieved person by herself or through a legal counsel?
The Apex Court in the case of Prabha Tyagi vs Kamlesh Devi  (SC) 474 observed that although, the expression 'shall' is used in the proviso to Section 12 of DV Act, it is restricted to only those cases where a Protection Officer files any Domestic Incident Report or, as the case may be, the service provider files such a report. 
"When a Domestic Incident Report is filed by a Protection Officer or a service provider, in such a case the Magistrate has to take into consideration the said report received by him. But if such a report has not been filed on behalf of the aggrieved person then he is not bound to consider any such report. Therefore, the expression 'shall' has to be read in the context of a Domestic Incident Report received by a Magistrate from the Protection Officer or the service provider as the case may be in which case, it is mandatory for the Magistrate to consider the report. But, if no such report is received by the Magistrate then the Magistrate is naturally not to consider any such Domestic Incident Report before passing any order on the application," the Court had held.
The case before the High Court
A complaint under Section 12 of the Act, 2005 was filed on 25th January 2022 by the aggrieved person herself, on which, the court concerned called for the DIR from the Protection Officer and fixed the matter for 3rd March, 2022. 
Now, on March 3, since the report was not made available, another application was moved by the applicants with the prayer to proceed in the matter and issue notice to the private respondents, but the court below rejected the said applicant and called for the DIR. Now, against that very order, the aggrieved person moved the High Court.
Allowing the plea, the High Court set aside the impugned order. The Court below was directed to proceed in the matter and conclude the same expeditiously, strictly in accordance with law and the principle laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Prabha Tyagi (supra), without giving any unnecessary adjournments to either of the parties.

Justice Prathiba M Singh disposed of Gupta’s plea challenging the motion passed by Assembly suspending him from attending the sittings of the House for one year till the next Budget Session. 
His suspension came into effect on March 21.
Perusing the summary of proceedings of the House of the relevant day, the court said that there was disturbance caused by both Gupta and the members of the ruling party. 
“There is no gainsaying that the Members of the Legislative Assembly or any other elected house have to maintain dignity of the house in order to play a positive role owing to the mandate of the people. only be gainsaid that the members of a legislative assembly or an elected house have to maintain the dignity,” Justice Singh observed.
Senior Advocate Jayant Mehta, appearing for Gupta, placed reliance on Rule 272 of Rules of Procedure & Conduct of Business, Legislative Assembly of National Capital Territory of Delhi which states that the suspension of a member has to be done in a “graded manner.”
He submitted that on first occasion, the suspension can be ordered for three sittings only. For second occasion, a member can be suspended for seven sittings and for another occasion, it can be for the remainder of the session, he told court.
However, Mehta argued that Gupta has been suspended for a year which is not in accordance with the provision.
It was also submitted that the debate arose due to a motion moved by Gupta with respect to the selective publication of a part of the budget. Mehta also relied on a Supreme Court judgment to contend that the graded suspension in terms of the Rules alone can be followed.
On the other hand, Advocate Samir Vashisht, appearing for the Delhi government, placed reliance on section 37 of GNCTD Act, 1991 to submit that the suspension cannot be inquired into by any court. 
He also submitted that Gupta’s suspension was done by the House itself and not the speaker and therefore, the House is fully empowered to issue a punishment of higher nature. 
Perusing the Rules and judgment of the Supreme Court, the court said that Rule 272 clearly states that the suspension has to be done in graded manner.
“The Budget Session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly is currently ongoing and the Petitioner has already remained suspended for four days i.e. 21st March, 2023; 22nd March, 2023; 23rd March, 2023 and 24th March, 2023 in view of the impugned suspension order. A perusal of the summary of proceedings extracted above shows that there was disturbance caused during the sitting of the House both by the Petitioner, as also by ruling party members,” the court observed.
It added: “The record of the proceedings shows that this was the first suspension which was meted out to the Petitioner. Accordingly, in terms of Rule 227(3)(b), the suspension could have only to be for a period of three days which the Petitioner has already served in effect.”
While disposing of the plea, Justice Singh however said that the question of law raised by Vashishth with respect to Rule 77 and Rule 277 are left open to be decided in an appropriate manner.
Gupta was also represented by Advocates Pavan Narang, Neeraj and Satya Ranjan Swain.
It was submitted in the plea that the order passed by the Speaker of Delhi Assembly is unjust, unfair and unreasonable. The petition saud that the order is non est and violates the “Rules of Procedure & Conduct of Business, Legislative Assembly of National Capital Territory of Delhi.”
“…the impugned action of the Hon'ble Speaker in permitting a ruling party MLA to move and proceed with the Motion to seek suspension of the Petitioner from the House for a period of one year does not come within the definition of irregular proceedings' but in fact is a classic case of being categorized as 'gross illegal' and "unconstitutional' but also contravention / violation of fundamental rights of the Petitioner under Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution of India,” the plea contended. 
Title: VIJENDER GUPTA v. LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF THE NATIONAL CAPITAL TERRITORY OF DELHI THROUGH SECRETARY & ANR.

Dismissing activist Umar Khalid's bail appeal in the larger conspiracy case of Northeast Delhi riots, the Delhi High Court on Tuesday said revolution by itself isn't always bloodless and that is why a prefix - bloodless, is used with the term 'bloodless revolution'.
"This court is reminded of that although, the activity of 'revolution' in its essential quality may not be different but from the point of view of Robespierre and Pandit Nehru, in its potentiality and in its effect upon public tranquillity there can be a vast difference," said the division bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar.
During the hearing of Khalid's bail appeal in May, Khalid had been questioned by the judges for his Amravati speech of February 2020 and more particularly the words used in reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi by him. What also had piqued the interest of the judges was the use of terms "inquilabli salam" (revolutionary salute) and "krantikari istiqbal" (revolutionary welcome) at the beginning of his speech as a greeting to invite the spirit of revolution.
Addressing Senior Advocate Trideep Pais, who represented Khalid, Justice Mridul had also asked him to look at what French lawyer and statesman Maximilien Robespierre had to say about revolution. Pais had argued that revolution can be non-violent also, and submitted there was no immediate violence after his speech.
In the judgement written by Justice Bhatnagar, the court on Tuesday said it was not impressed by the argument as the call to revolution does not have to affect only the immediate gathering.
"The call to revolution may affect many beyond those who were visibly present, which is why this court finds it apt to mention Robespierre, who was at the vanguard of the French revolution. This court is of the view that possibly, if the appellant had referred to Maximilien Robespierre for what he meant by revolution, he must have also known what revolution meant for our freedom fighter & first prime minister," said the bench.
The court added that that Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru believed that democracy has made revolution superfluous after independence and how it meant the complete opposite of a bloodless change.
"Revolution by itself isn't always bloodless, which is why it is contradistinctly used with the prefix - a 'bloodless' revolution. So, when we use the expression 'revolution', it is not necessarily bloodless," said the court.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently quashed the charge-sheet and consequential proceedings in a case registered for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (PC Act), observing that the investigating agency proceeded for prosecution based on half-baked material, and that allowing trial to proceed on the basis of the same would be an exercise in futility, inevitably resulting...
The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently quashed the charge-sheet and consequential proceedings in a case registered for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (PC Act), observing that the investigating agency proceeded for prosecution based on half-baked material, and that allowing trial to proceed on the basis of the same would be an exercise in futility, inevitably resulting in the discharge of the accused.
 The division bench of Justice Sheel Nagu and Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav was essentially dealing an application under Section 482 of CrPC, seeking directions of the Court to quash the charge-sheet and the consequential proceedings against the Applicant for offence under Section 7 of the PC Act.
 The question before the Court was whether the charge-sheet could be quashed when the only evidence collected during the investigation was as follows-
 Written complaint of the Complainant;A recorded conversation between the Complainant and Applicant, which the FSL reported to be not clear enough to match with the sample voice of the Applicant;Statement of shadow witness, who merely saw the Complainant and Applicant sitting in the car, but did not hear the conversation between them.
 The Applicant argued that even if the the aforesaid available evidence collected by prosecution during investigation was to be accepted on its face value, it could not lead to commission of an offence punishable under Section 7 of the PC Act, as alleged. It was further submitted that there were certain other undisputed facts, which revealed patent improbability of the incident and the foundational complaint being malicious.
 The Court noted that in the instant case, the facts revealed that besides the written complaint of the Complainant and the statement of the shadow witness under Section 161 CrPC, there was no other implicative piece of evidence collected by the prosecution. The Court further opined that the said complaint could've metamorphized into filing of charge-sheet, had the voice in the DVR matched with the voice sample collected from Petitioner, but that was not the case.
 The Court held that the investigating agency ought to collect implicative evidence to substantiate a written compliant. It observed that mere registration of cases based on written complaint, without implicative evidence would result in disastrous consequences-
 "In an offence punishable u/S. 7 of the PC Act, the least that is required of the Investigating Agency is to collect implicative evidence/material to support the allegation contained in the written complaint. In absence of any such supportive implicative material/evidence, if an offence is registered, merely on the basis of written complaint of complainant, then disastrous consequence can befall upon all public servants thereby exposing them to registration of offence and filing of charge-sheet."
It added,
"A written complaint can be made by any person who nurses a grudge or prejudice against the public servant. The public servant would stand exposed to criminal prosecution on the mere making of a written complaint. This scenario would led to chaos in the administration of service. The public servant shall not be able to discharge his official duties in a free and fair manner due to the ever present feeling of lurking fear in the mind that any act of discharge of official duties can trigger a criminal prosecution."
 Placing its reliance on the jurisprudence laid out by the Supreme Court with regard to the subject concerned, the Court further opined-
 For an allegation to mature into an FIR, least that is required is that the allegation/first information discloses commission of cognizable offence. Whereas for an FIR to mature into a charge-sheet/final report u/S.173(2) Cr.P.C., it has to undergo the arduous journey from Sec.154 to Sec. 176 (Chapter XII) Cr.P.C. where implicative evidence if any is collected in support of the FIR in a unilateral process called investigation.
 Investigation is a unilateral process, being out of bounds for the accused. The investigating agency is thus expected to act in a free, fair and impartial manner with no element of prejudice coming into play for or against the accused or victim. Investigation as is well known is a probe in the dark starting from the known to the unknown moving backwards in time, in search of truth.
The Court reiterated that the investigating agency is obliged, while discharging its statutory duty under Chapter XII CrPC, to ensure that the final report under Section 173(1) CrPC, if prepared and filed before the court, is accompanied with such supportive/corroborative evidence which gives rise to serious and strong suspicion of involvement of accused in the offence alleged. Another test, the Court noted, to confirm the validity and lawfulness of charge-sheet/final report would be to see if the evidence/material contained therein is left uncontroverted, which would ensure that the same could sustain a conviction.
 Considering the material placed on record in the case in hand, the Court held that the same was not enough for filing a report under Section 173 CrPC and for further taking cognizance. It also noted that the investigating agency should've ideally pursued a fresh exercise to record statement of the Applicant to implicate him after learning that the evidence that they had collected was not implicative. The Court observed-
 Pertinently when the Investigating Agency was faced with a non- implicative Forensic Report then the only option available to the Investigating Agency was to go in for a fresh exercise of recording of statement of petitioner by laying of another trap. Instead, the Investigating Agency decided to proceed with the half baked material in shape of written complaint and the statement of shadow witness – Constable Dinesh Dubey, who had not even heard the conversation between petitioner and the complainant. This kind of an exercise by Investigating Agency amounts to utter abuse of process of Court. The charge-sheet filed is thus a waste of precious time of the Court which would be involved in a trial where discharge is inevitable and fait accompli.
 Regard being had to the above, this case is one of those rarest of rare cases where without entering into the reliability, genuineness or veracity of the evidence collected, this Court is compelled to invoke it's inherent powers u/S.482 Cr.P.C. to truncate the prosecution which in turn is based on premature investigation.
 With the aforesaid observations, the Court decided to quash the charge-sheet filed in the case and the consequential proceedings followed by it.

The Bombay High Court has rejected a review application filed by three accused in the Bhima Koregaon – Elgar Parishad Case seeking bail and factual corrections in the order refusing them default bail.

The Bombay High Court has rejected a review application filed by three accused in the Bhima Koregaon – Elgar Parishad Case seeking bail and factual corrections in the order refusing them default bail.
 The court disposed of a review application filed by the three, seeking factual corrections in the order refusing them default bail and subsequently release.
 A division bench led by Justice SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar had reserved the plea for orders on March 22, 2022. Today, it pronounced the operative portion of the order stating,
"No case for exercise of review jurisdiction is made out. A point which was not urged, is impermissible to be reviewed."
 On December 1, 2021, the High Court denied default bail to the petitioners and five of their co-accused on the ground that they had not filed their default bail applications within the stipulated period, which is after 60 days of their arrest and before filing of the charge sheet. 
 The same bench held that even though the Pune Sessions Judge extended their detention after 60 days without jurisdiction, since he was not a special judge under the NIA Act, they were not entitled to relief. Co-accused Sudha Bharadwaj was, however, granted bail in the same order.
 All the eight who were denied relief claimed that denial of bail was on account of a factual error; as just like Bharadwaj, they had also filed default bail applications in the trial could within the stipulated period.
 Gonsalves, Rao and Ferreira claimed they applied for default bail on November 30, 2018, just four days after Bharadwaj's application. In the plea filed through Advocate R Sathyanarayanan they contended that the Pune Sessions Court rejected their default bail applications and Bharadwaj's default bail plea in a common order on November 6, 2019. They pointed out that the November 6, 2019 order was set aside by the High Court while granting bail to Bharadwaj.
 Finally the application states that the High Court has plenary powers to correct such factual errors.
 "If such power of correcting its own record is denied to the High Court, when it notices the apparent errors its consequence is that the superior status of the High Court will dwindle down. Therefore, it is only proper to think that the plenary powers of the High Court would include the power of review relating to errors apparent on the face of the record," the accused said in their application. 
 However, the bench asked them to point out if this was brought to the court's notice when their applications were being heard. 
 Opposing the application the National Investigating Agency cited the embargo on a bench under Section 362 of CrPC to alter or review judgements once a petition is decided on merits.
 Advocate Sandesh Patil for NIA, said that the accused directly wanted the final observation altered, which was made final after due verification of record. "Thus, the applicants/accused persons ought not to crave. any relief that is subjected to judicial proceedings that to be exercised to alter or review the order which expressly barred by the Code of Criminal Procedure," the reply read.
 The agency argued that the accused should have approached the Supreme Court in appeal instead of the High Court.
 Case 
 The National Investigation Agency booked 16 civil liberties activists under sections 121, 121A, 124A, 153A, 505(1)(b), 117, 120b r/w 34 of the IPC and sections 13,16,17,18,18-B,20,38,39 and 40 of the UAPA. Father Stan Swamy, the 16th accused to be arrested, passed away on July 5 2021, ahead of his bail hearing. 
 The NIA has accused them of a plot to overthrow the Government and of being members of front organisations of the banned CPI(Maoists). 
 The agency has accused the activists for furthering the CPI(Maoist) agenda and causing the caste violence at the Bhima Koregaon war memorial on January 1, 2018, through the Elgar Parishad event held a day prior. 
 However, the arrested activists have said that incriminating material was planted on Gadling and co-accused researcher Rona Wilson's laptop, based on an independent US-based forensic analysis report.
 Apart from Bharadwaj and Rao (granted bail on medical grounds), all the accused are still in prison.
 As for Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Shoma Sen and Mahesh Raut, they are pursing their default bail pleas filed on September 26, 2018, i.e. 90 days after their arrest on July 6 and before the first charge sheet against them was submitted on November 15, 2018. They have sought for the special court to decide these applications now.

Dealing with the case of the death of a 16-year-old girl from Mainpuri, the Allahabad High Court on Thursday asked the Uttar Pradesh government as to whether it has issued an order directing the investigating officers to comply with Section 173 of CrPC mandating the completion of investigation of sexual offences within a time frame
If circular/direction has not been issued to date, the Court directed, then immediately an order be issued. 
It may be noted that as per Section 173 (1-A) of CrPC, the duration to complete the investigation in a case registered for the offence under Sections 376, 376-A, 376-AB, 376-B, 376-C, 376-D, 376-DA, 376-DB or 376-E I.P.C is "two months" (from the date on which the information was recorded by the officer in charge of the police station).
Now, coming to the instant case, the Bench of Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice Anil Kumar Ojha has further directed the state government and the police authorities to apprise it in a month on the progress in the investigation.
Uttar Pradesh DGP also submitted that action was taken against those police officers who defaulted in conducting the investigation in a fair and proper manner. He added that the investigating officer Pahup Singh had been placed under suspension.
A perusal of the reasons for placing the IO under suspension showed serious lapses in the investigation. 
It was found that in the vaginal slide, human semen was found apart from sperm on the underwear of the deceased girl. Despite receipt of the report from F.S.L., Agra, the Investigating Officer did not send for DNA test of those persons within 45 days who were named in the F.I.R. or who were suspected and thereby subsequent DNA remains of no use.
With regard to the inquiry against the then Superintendent of Police, Mainpuri, the Court was told that it would be completed soon. Furthermore, two other officers, namely, Additional Superintendent of Police Om Prakash and Deputy Superintendent of Police Priyank Jain were also suspended.
The DGP informed the Court that a new SIT was formed to investigate the case within the shortest possible time and it would complete the investigation within a period of six weeks.
Senior Advocate Amrendra Nath Singh, who was appointed by the Court to assist it in the matter, assisted by Advocates Chhaya Gupta, Prabha Shankar Mishra and other Bar Members told the Bench that the present case did not show any serious lapse of investigation but was a case where the effort of the investigating team was to give benefit to the accused. 
Referring to the F.I.R., he submitted that the incident took place at around 5.30-6.00 AM but the parents were not informed about the incident by the Principal of the school rather knowledge of the incident was gathered from a relative named Vijay Mishra who was present in the hospital for the treatment of his wife. 
Advocate Singh also stated that statement of the father was not recorded despite being material to the case and even the statement of the named accused were recorded after three months and he was not arrested despite serious allegations against them. 
"The effort was to somehow make them free and thereby no evidence relevant to the case was collected rather subsequent investigation was also to give clean chit to the accused."
The Senior Counsel submitted that the investigation should now be conducted under the supervision of the High Court.
While remarking that the instant investigation would now be under its supervision, the Court made it clear that if any matter came before any Court in reference to the present case, the detailed order issued by it would be produced before the Court concerned to give reasons for holding a fresh investigation and further action in the matter so that directions issued in the public interest litigation may not go unnoticed by any Court for taking proper decision. In regard to Section 173 (2) Cr.P.C.
 which mandated completion of investigation within a time frame, the DGP has been directed to find out whether necessary order has been issued by the State Government to direct the investigating officers for compliance of the provisions, as amended. "If circular/direction has been issued till date, then immediately an order be issued. Delay in the investigation in such cases should be made subject or explanation otherwise delay without any reason should invite action against the defaulting officers. The provision of Section 173 Cr.P.C., as amended, should not be taken casually rather seriousness should be attached."
The Government has also been directed to take action against the defaulting officers. The Court further opined that,"If the investigating officers are not efficient then in future they should not be assigned investigation of the case. It is further directed that in the investigation, all scientific methods should be applied because defective investigation or investigation without collection of proper evidence, results in acquittal and therefore only the conviction rate is only 6 to 7%. We direct the police administration to not only monitor the investigation but guide the investigating officers to apply the scientific methods for investigation and for that periodically training program should be arranged."
The Bench added that not only the investigating officer but the officers who supervise the investigation should also be made responsible if any defect is found in the investigation. Looking at the seriousness of the case Senior Counsel Singh further requested the Court to look into the security of the victim's family and the petitioner. this prompted the Court to provide adequate security to the family of the deceased and the petitioner.The DGP has also been directed to closely monitor the progress of the investigation so that it may reach its logical conclusion.Recently, the Court had pulled up the investigating officer when he could not explain the delay in interrogating the accused in the case, while remarking that this lag occurred despite serious allegations against the accused. It had thus summoned the Director-General of Police, UP.
The Court had then asked the DGP, and the members of the SIT team to explain the inaction of the Police Authorities in the investigation.
Moreover, the Director General of Police, who appeared in person, has been asked to ensure that probe in rape cases are completed within two months.
Cause Title: Mahendra Pratap Singh v State Of U.P. Through Secretary (Home) And 2 Others

The Allahabad High Court has said that a departmental inquiry against a government servant is not to be treated as a casual exercise and the principles of natural justice are required to be observed so as to ensure not only that justice is done but is manifestly seen to be done.
The Bench of Justice Yogendra Kumar Srivastava observed thus as it upheld an order of the UP State Public Services Tribunal, Lucknow setting aside the order of punishment passed by the State of UP against respondent no. 2 (deceased govt employee).
The case in brief
Essentially, disciplinary proceedings were initiated against a government servant/respondent no. 2 (deceased) while he was posted as Collection Amin at Jahanabad, District Pilibhit, and a charge sheet was issued whereupon an inquiry was conducted and a report was submitted holding respondent no. 2 guilty of the charges. 
A show-cause notice was issued to him to which he submitted a reply and thereafter, the order of punishment was passed on 30.04.2005 whereby respondent no 2 was reverted to his original pay scale in addition to the award of adverse entry in his character role. The appeal and revision filed were ALSO dismissed.
Challenging the same, he moved to the UP State Public Services Tribunal, which took into consideration the inquiry report and thereafter, came to a conclusion that neither any date, time, or place was fixed by the inquiry officer nor any oral evidence was led.
The Tribunal also concluded that only on the basis of some documentary evidence, the respondent no. 2 was held guilty of the charges. In view of this, the Tribunal held that respondent no. 2 was not afforded an opportunity to adduce evidence and was denied the reasonable opportunity of defence. 
However, taking notice of the fact that respondent no. 2 had expired during the pendency of the claim petition, the Tribunal held that no fruitful purpose would be served in remitting the matter for fresh inquiry.
In view thereof, while setting aside the orders of punishment, the appellate order, and the revisional order, the benefits withheld due to the punishment order were directed to be refunded to the legal representatives of respondent no. 2. Challenging this order, the State of UP moved to the HC.
Court's observations
The Court agreed with the findings of the Tribunal that the reply submitted by the employee to the show cause notice issued by the disciplinary authority consequent to the inquiry and the defence raised therein were not accorded consideration.
The Court also noted that the disciplinary authority had passed the order of punishment only on the basis of inquiry report in gross disregard to the provisions under the Rules, 1999 and also the principles of natural justice.
"The departmental proceedings pursuant to which the punishment order has been passed having thus not followed the procedure prescribed under the Rules, 1999 and there being several procedural infirmities in the conduct of enquiry, the order of punishment has rightly been held to be legally unsustainable," the Court further held.
In view of this, the Court observed that in the instant case, the inquiry officer had failed to fix any date, place, or time in the conduct of inquiry. 
The Court also took into account the fact that no witnesses were examined to support the charges leveled against the respondent-employee, and this had led to a situation where the delinquent had been condemned unheard. 
Therefore, finding that the entire proceedings were held in violation of principles of natural justice and total disregard of procedural fairness, the Court UPHELD the order of the Tribunal and thus, DISMISSED the instant plea moved by the State Government.
Case title - State Of U.P. Through Secretary Revenue And 4 Others v. State Public Service Tribunal And 4 Others

The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday observed that if the prosecution has failed to prove the charge of dacoity then the charge under Section 412 of the IPC of retaining the stolen articles of dacoity fails automatically.
Section 412 of the IPC provides that whoever dishonestly receives or retains any stolen property, the possession whereof he knows or has reason to believe to have been transferred by the commission of dacoity, or dishonestly receives from a person, whom he knows or has reason to believe to belong or to have belonged to a gang of dacoits, property which he knows or has reason to believe to have been stolen, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
Referring to the provision of Section 412 of the IPC, Justice Rabindranath Samanta underscored,
"The language employed in the Section clearly shows that the articles an accused retains shall be related to those articles captured or received during the commission of dacoity. While the charge of dacoity fails, the charge under Section 412, IPC automatically fails..Therefore, I hold that the prosecution has failed to bring home the charge under Section 412, IPC."
Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court decision in K. Venkateshwar Rao alias Venkatal alias I. Rao v. State Represented by Inspector of Police, A.P wherein the Apex Court had held that while the charge of dacoity has not been proved by the prosecution, the charge under Section 412 of the IPC of retaining the stolen articles of dacoity fails automatically. 
The instant appeal had been filed against an order of conviction wherein the appellant had been convicted for the commission of the offence punishable under Section 412 of the IPC. The appellant contended that since the concerned trial Court had held that the prosecution has failed to prove the charges of dacoity under Sections 395 and 397 of the IPC, then the charge under Section 412 of IPC is also not tenable against the appellant.
The counsel appearing for the State submitted that that there is no fetter on the part of a Court to record conviction separately for offence punishable under Section 412 of the IPC if the Court finds that the evidence produced is credible. He further submitted that oral and documentary evidence adduced by the prosecution demonstrate that the appellant possessed the stolen articles derived from the dacoity.
On the contrary, the amicus curiae appointed by the Court contended that while the charges under Sections 395 and 397 of the IPC have not been proved, the appellant could not be held guilty under Section 412 of the IPC which forms an integral part of the charges under Sections 395 and 397 of the IPC.
Case Title: Ramabatar Rajbar @ Ramawatar Nimtar Rajwar v. The State of West Bengal

The Delhi High Court has ruled that, in view of Section 28 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a party cannot be permitted to restrict the period of limitation for invoking arbitration, in contravention to the limitation period provided by law.

The Delhi High Court has ruled that, in view of Section 28 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a party cannot be permitted to restrict the period of limitation for invoking arbitration, in contravention to the limitation period provided by law. The Court observed that a lesser period of limitation provided under the Contract between the parties would be hit by Section 28.
 While dealing with an appeal filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act), the Court dismissed the contention of the appellant/award debtor that the claims raised by the claimant were time-barred. 
 Noting that the limitation period for invoking arbitration under the A&C Act is three years, as prescribed under Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963, the bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri remarked that the appellant cannot be permitted to rely on the relevant clause of the Contract and restrict the period of limitation for invoking arbitration to 120 days.
 As per Section 28 (b) of the Contract Act, any agreement which extinguishes the rights of any party, or discharges any party, from any liability, under or in respect of any contract on the expiry of a specified period so as to restrict it from enforcing its rights, is void to the extent.
 The appellant, Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), floated a tender for providing and fixing a Retro- Reflective Sign Board. The respondent, Natraj Construction Company, was awarded the contract and a work order was issued in its favour.
 The MCD passed a sanction order clearing the bill raised by the respondent. However, the said amount was not paid since the CBI had registered an FIR with respect to the, alleged, sub-standard quality of work in relating to fixation of the Sign Board. In the said FIR, the officials of MCD as well as the respondent were named as accused persons.
 Thereafter, the respondent, Natraj Construction Company, invoked the arbitration clause contained in the agreement executed between the parties. The Arbitral Tribunal allowed the claim raised by the respondent and passed an award in its favour, awarding an amount, along with interest, for the work done by it under the work order. MCD filed a petition under Section 34 of the A&C Act before the District Court, challenging the arbitral award. The District Court dismissed the petition and upheld the award.
 Challenging the District Court’s order, MCD filed an appeal under Section 37 of the A&C Act before the Delhi High Court.
 The MCD submitted before the High Court that since the matter was under investigation by the CBI, the Trial Court ought to have interfered with the award in terms of Section 34(2)(b) of the A&C Act.
 It added that as per the relevant clause contained in the Contract Agreement between the parties, any challenge made by the respondent was required to be raised within 120 days from the date the MCD cleared the bill raised by the respondent. Since the arbitration proceedings were initiated much later, the claim was time barred, it averred.
 The Court, while referring to the amended provisions of Section 28 of the Contract Act, dismissed MCD’s contention that the claims were time barred.
 The bench referred to the decision of the Delhi High Court in M/s. Smart Commodity Broker Pvt Ltd. vs. Beant Singh (2017), where the High Court had ruled that, in view of Section 28 of the Contract Act, as amended by the Amendment Act of 1996, a party by contract cannot limit the limitation period which is otherwise provided by law. Therefore, a lesser period of limitation provided under the Contract would be hit by Section 28 of the Contract Act, the Court had ruled.
 While noting that the limitation period for invoking arbitration under the A&C Act is as prescribed under Article 137 of the Limitation Act, i.e., a period of three years, the bench remarked that in view of Section 28 of the Contract Act, MCD cannot be permitted to rely on the relevant Clause of the Contract Agreement and restrict the period of limitation for invoking arbitration to 120 days. 
 Perusing the chargesheet filed by the CBI, the Court further reckoned that, “A perusal of the chargesheet would show that though during investigation, the CBI seized a number of documents, the chargesheet was filed only in relation to Work Order bearing No.850 dated 09.02.2004. Pertinently, the Work Order in the present case being Work Order No.933/EE/RD1/RZ/TC/03- 04/31/11 dated 09.03.2004 was seized during investigation but was neither made part of the chargesheet nor relied upon.”
 Concluding that the chargesheet filed by the CBI was not in relation to the Work Order under consideration, and that the pendency of CBI proceedings were in relation to a different Work Order, the Court dismissed the appellant’s contention that the award was in conflict with the public policy of India.
 The Court also referred to the Supreme Court’s decision in Swiss Timing Limited vs. Commonwealth Games 2010 Organizing Committee (2014), where it was held that there is no inherent risk of prejudice to the parties in permitting arbitration to proceed simultaneously with the criminal proceedings.
 The Court thus dismissed the appeal.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently allowed the medical termination of a 30 week unwanted foetus, observing that while exercising the powers under Article 226 of the Constitution, a Constitutional Court has got wider powers than what is prescribed under Section 3(2) of the MTP Act of 1971.
The directions were passed by Justice Sanjay Dhar while hearing a plea filed by a minor through her father seeking termination of pregnancy of minor. 
After perusing the case diary the bench noted that on Feb 27th 2023, the father of the victim had lodged a report with the police alleging that his daughter, aged about 11 years has become pregnant because someone has committed rape upon her. On the basis of this report, FIR for offences under Sections 363, 376, 506 IPC and 4 of POCSO Act came to be registered and investigation was set into motion.
The bench further noted that the victim had been subjected to medical examination whereby medical opinion had revealed that the sexual contact been made and patient is currently 30 weeks pregnant with a single line intrauterine fetus.
Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Dhar observed that the present case is a "sad and sordid" tale of a victim girl who has been made pregnant at the tender age of 11 years, adding that "She is studying only in the 4th class and is expecting a great future ahead of her,". 
Explaining law applicable to the instant matter the court said that Rule 3B of the Medical Termination of pregnancy Rules 2003 clearly specify that survivors of sexual assault or rape or incest as also the minors are eligible for termination of pregnancy upto 24 weeks. In addition to this, Explanation-2 to Section 3 of the Act of 1971 provides that when pregnancy occurs because of rape, the anguish caused by such pregnancy shall be presumed to constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman, the bench underscored. 
Referring to a cetena of Supreme court judgements on the issue, Justice Dhar observed that Constitutional Courts, on account of the fact that they are vested with wider powers, can permit termination of pregnancy beyond 24 weeks in appropriate and deserving cases.
"Thus, while exercising the powers under Article 226 of the Constitution, this Court has got wider powers than what is prescribed under Section 3(2) of the Act of 1971, which permits termination of pregnancy only when the length of pregnancy does not exceed a maximum period of 24 weeks", the bench maintained. 
In view of the tender age of the victim, the bench said that if permission to terminate the pregnancy is not granted to the victim, who has expressed her desire to terminate the pregnancy, it will have serious consequences not only on her physical health but also upon mental health of the victim because she will have to live with the trauma and stigma of unwanted procreation throughout her life.
This will not be in her interest and would also not be in the interests of the child that may be born. In these circumstances, if permission is not granted to the victim to terminate her pregnancy, she would be exposed to a miserable future," the court said adding that the father of the victim has also expressed his desire that the pregnancy of the victim needs to be terminated and he has also filed a petition for that.
Justice Dhar further observed that whether termination of pregnancy of the victim at this stage would be medically feasible or whether it would involve any danger to her life, are the issues which have to be gone into by the experts in the relevant field, whereafter they have to take a decision as to whether or not the pregnancy of the victim should be terminated.
"In case the Medical Board is of the opinion that termination of pregnancy of the minor victim can be undertaken without risk to her life, the Principal, GMC, Srinagar, shall ensure that termination of pregnancy of the minor victim is undertaken by competent doctors in accordance with the provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act and rules framed thereunder and all other regulations and guidelines prescribed for the purpose," the court said.
Allowing the plea, the court directed the Principal, Government Medical College (GMC) Srinagar, to immediately constitute a Medical Board of a Gynaecologist, Paediatrician, Radiologist or Sonologist, Psychiatrist and any other expert that may be deemed necessary by the Principal to medically examine the victim on March 21.
The bench further directed that if the child is born alive despite the attempts of medical termination of pregnancy, the doctors shall ensure that all necessary care is given to the child.
Directing the government to bear all necessary expenses for termination of pregnancy of the victim, the bench asked the Principal GMC to furnish a report before the Registrar Judicial of the Court within ten days, whereafter the Registrar Judicial shall list the matter before the Court on March, 31 to report compliance.

The Orissa High Court has recently denied bail to a man, who was accused of having sexual intercourse against the will of a woman on the false assurance of marriage. While rejecting the bail, a Single Judge Bench of Justice Sanjeeb Kumar Panigrahi quoted the following observation made by the Supreme Court in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Madanlal,
 "Dignity of a woman is a part of her non-perishable and immortal self and no one should ever think of painting it in clay. There cannot be a compromise or settlement as it would be against her honour which matters the most. It is sacrosanct. Sometimes solace is given that the perpetrator of the crime has acceded to enter into wedlock with her which is nothing but putting pressure in an adroit manner; and we say with emphasis that the courts are to remain absolutely away from this subterfuge to adopt a soft approach to the case, for any kind of liberal approach has to be put in the compartment of spectacular error. Or to put it differently, it would be in the realm of a sanctuary of error."
 Brief Facts:
 The victim lodged a written complaint before the Jenapur police station wherein she submitted that the appellant and herself were in a romantic relationship for past one year. The appellant had given assurance to marry her. On 08.02.2020, the appellant took her to an open field, where he had sexual intercourse with her against her consent. However, he and his family members subsequently backtracked from agreeing for the marriage proposal.
 The appellant was accordingly charge-sheeted for commission of offences punishable under Sections 376, 493, 417 and 506 of IPC read with section 3(1)(r)(s) and 2(va) of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. As his bail was denied by the lower Court, he had filed the instant appeal against the said order.
 Contentions:
 Mr. B.N. Mohapatra, counsel appearing for the accused-appellant submitted that the appellant has been languishing in custody since 23.03.2020. He further contended that all the allegations against him are false, baseless and the appellant is no way connected to the matter. On perusal of the FIR and the other connected materials, no prima facie case, can be made out against him. Both the individuals have attained the age of majority and the sexual relationship between them was consensual. Moreover, the medical report does not show any sign or symptoms of rape. Hence, he stressed that the appellant should be released on bail.
 Court's Observations:
 The Court highlighted the value of reputation of woman by citing the following observations made by the Apex Court in Shyam Narain v. State (NCT of Delhi),
 "Respect for reputation of women in the society shows the basic civility of a civilised society. No member of society can afford to conceive the idea that he can create a hollow in the honour of a woman. Such thinking is not only lamentable but also deplorable. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the thought of sullying the physical frame of a woman is the demolition of the accepted civilised norm i.e. 'physical morality'. In such a sphere, impetuosity has no room. The youthful excitement has no place. It should be paramount in everyone's mind that, on the one hand, society as a whole cannot preach from the pulpit about social, economic and political equality of the sexes and, on the other, some perverted members of the same society dehumanise the woman by attacking her body and ruining her chastity. It is an assault on the individuality and inherent dignity of a woman with the mindset that she should be elegantly servile to men."
 Accordingly, having consideration for the nature and gravity of the accusation, character of evidence appearing against the appellant, the stringent punishment prescribed and that there being no reasonable grounds for believing that the appellant is not guilty of the offence alleged or not likely to commit any such offence, it concluded that the prayer for bail is devoid of any merit.

The Supreme Court held that 'pharmaceutical companies' gifting freebies to doctors is prohibited by law and they cannot claim it as a deduction under Section 37(1) of the Income Tax Act.
These freebies are technically not 'free' – the cost of supplying such freebies is usually factored into the drug, driving prices up, thus creating a perpetual publicly injurious cycle, the bench comprising Justices Uday Umesh Lalit and S.Ravindra Bhat remarked.
Section 37 provides that any expenditure (not being expenditure of the nature described in Sections 30 to 36 and not being in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee), laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business or profession shall be allowed in computing the income chargeable under the head "Profits and gains of business or profession".
The Explanation 1 clarifies that any expenditure incurred by an assessee for any purpose which is an offence or which is prohibited by law shall not be deemed to have been incurred for the purpose of business or profession and no deduction or allowance shall be made in respect of such expenditure.
Regulation 6.8. of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 makes acceptance of freebies given by pharmaceutical companies by the medical practitioner, punishable with varying consequences.
The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( "CBDT") issued a circular , which clarified that expenses incurred by pharmaceutical and allied health sector industries for distribution of incentives (i.e., "freebies") to medical practitioners are ineligible for the benefit of Explanation 1 to Section 37(1). It issued a notice to Apex Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. to explain why the expenditure of ₹ 4,72,91,159/- incurred towards gifting freebies such as hospitality, conference fees, gold coins, LCD TVs, fridges, laptops, etc. to medical practitioners for creating awareness about the health supplement 'Zincovit', should not be added back to the total income of Apex. The Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax partially allowed amounts claimed by Apex as 'business expenditure' under Section 37(1).  The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) partly allowed the appeal. The Madras High Court dismissed the challenge against this order passed by CIT(A). 
Before the Apex Court, the appellants contended that 2002 Regulations were not applicable to Apex, i.e., pharmaceutical companies were not bound by them. On the other hand, the Revenue authorities submitted that the act of pharmaceutical companies gifting freebies to medical practitioners for promotion of their products may not be classified as an 'offence' under any statue, it was squarely covered within the scope of Explanation 1 to Section 37(1) by use of the words "prohibited by law", as it was specifically prohibited by the amended 2002 Regulations.
Referring to Section 37, the bench observed that Explanation 1 contains within its ambit all such activities which are illegal/prohibited by law and/or punishable. The court observed:
"Section 37 is a residuary provision. Any business or professional expenditure which does not ordinarily fall under Sections 30-36, and which are not in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses, can claim the benefit of this 9 exemption. But the same is not absolute. Explanation 1, which was inserted in 1998 with retrospective effect from 01.04.1962, restricts the application of such exemption for "any purpose which is an offence or which is prohibited by law". The IT Act does not provide a definition for these terms. Section 2(38) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 defines 'offence' as "any act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force". Under the IPC, Section 40 defines it as "a thing punishable by this Code", read with Section 43 which defines 'illegal' as being applicable to "everything which is an offence or which is prohibited by law, or which furnishes ground for a civil action". It is therefore clear that Explanation 1 contains within its ambit all such activities which are illegal/prohibited by law and/or punishable."
The court also noted that the 2002 regulations makes acceptance of freebies given by pharmaceutical companies is clearly an offence on part of the medical practitioner, punishable with varying consequences. While dismissing the appeal, the court made the following observations as well:
Denial of the tax benefit cannot be construed as penalizing the assessee pharmaceutical company.
It is also a settled principle of law that no court will lend its aid to a party that roots its cause of action in an immoral or illegal act (ex dolo malo non oritur action) meaning that none should be allowed to profit from any wrongdoing coupled with the fact that statutory regimes should be coherent and not self-defeating. Doctors and pharmacists being complementary and supplementary to each other in the medical profession, a comprehensive view must be adopted to regulate their conduct in view of the contemporary statutory regimes and regulations. Therefore, denial of the tax benefit cannot be construed as penalizing the assessee pharmaceutical company. Only its participation in what is plainly an action prohibited by law, precludes the assessee from claiming it as a deductible expenditure.
Freebies are technically not 'free' – the cost of supplying such freebies is usually factored into the drug, driving prices up, thus creating a perpetual publicly injurious cycle.
This Court also notices that medical practitioners have a quasi-fiduciary relationship with their patients. A doctor's prescription is considered the final word on the medication to be availed by the patient, even if the cost of such medication is unaffordable or barely within the economic reach of the patient – such is the level of trust reposed in doctors. Therefore, it is a matter of great public importance and concern, when it is demonstrated that a doctor's prescription can be manipulated, and driven by the motive to avail the freebies offered to them by pharmaceutical companies, ranging from gifts such as gold coins, fridges and LCD TVs to funding international trips for vacations or to attend medical conferences. These freebies are technically not 'free' – the cost of supplying such freebies is usually factored into the drug, driving prices up, thus creating a perpetual publicly injurious cycle. 
Doing so would wholly undermine public policy
"The pharmaceutical companies' gifting freebies to doctors, etc. is clearly "prohibited by law", and not allowed to be claimed as a deduction under Section 37(1). Doing so would wholly undermine public policy....
..In the present case too, the incentives (or "freebies") given by Apex, to the doctors, had a direct result of exposing the recipients to the odium of sanctions, leading to a ban on their practice of medicine. Those sanctions are mandated by law, as they are embodied in the code of conduct and ethics, which are normative, and have legally binding effect. The conceded participation of the assessee- i.e., the provider or donor- was plainly prohibited, as far as their receipt by the medical practitioners was concerned. That medical practitioners were forbidden from accepting such gifts, or "freebies" was no less a prohibition on the part of their giver, or donor, i.e., Apex.", the court said.

The Supreme Court has observed that office-bearers of the Bar Association arre to be elected by genuine voters and advocates genuinely/regularly practising in the High Court/Court concerned. Outsiders not regularly practicing in that court cannot be permitted to hijack the system by permitting them to take part in the election process of electing members of the Bar Association, the Court added.
"Office bearers of the Bar Association are to be elected by the genuine voters and the advocates genuinely/regularly practicing in the High Court and/or the Court concerned, and outsiders not regularly practicing in that court cannot be permitted to hijack the system by permitting them to take part in the election process of electing members of the Bar Association", a bench comprising Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna observed.
The bench made these observations while dismissing the special leave petitions assailing Allahabad High Court's order dated August 24 and August 27 of cancelling the election process and imposing some restrictions while conducting elections of the Awadh Bar Association afresh.
The elections were cancelled after widespread ruckus and misbehaviour occurred.
"Any member of the Bar cannot be permitted to misbehave in the premises of the High Court. The manner in which the lawyers acted and misbehaved on 14.08.2021 in the premises of the High Court, where the election of the Awadh Bar Association was going on, cannot be tolerated and accepted and has to be deprecated," bench further observed. 
 "Being a member of the legal profession, which always is being considered as a noble profession, what message the lawyers, who misbehaved will give to the public at large," Court also added.
 Appearing for petitioners Amit Sachan and Alok Tripathi who are practicing lawyers and contesting the election of the Awadh Bar Association, Senior Advocate R Balasubramanian submitted that the High Court without appreciating that it would be very difficult to bring back nearly 4500 members again for voting in this pandemic situation, cancelled the election of the Awadh Bar Association which were held on August 14, 2021. It was also their contention as far as the earlier election was concerned, only polling was cancelled by the Returning Officer.
 Senior Counsel also argued that the High Court was not at all justified in declaring fresh elections since in the election which was held on August 14, 2021, only 3614 members out of 4500 had cast their votes directly and the remaining members who had to cast their vote were only 1219.
 The High Court bench of Justices Ritu Raj Awasthi and Dinesh Kumar Singh had taken suo motu cognizance of the unruly, incident and rustic behaviour and breach of protocol by some of the lawyers during the Awadh Bar Elections on August 14, 2021, that had ultimately led to the cancellation of the election of Awadh Bar Association since this had caused security issues in the High Court's premises. It had also compelled the officers and Police to intervene to maintain the decorum.
 The Supreme Court noted that "In the election of Awadh Bar Association scheduled to be held on 14.08.2021, the candidates/advocates alongwith their supporters entered into the voting arena and indulged in tearing ballot papers and in pushing female lawyers and misbehaving with them. Even one lawyer was seriously injured and his hand got fractured in the incident. One lawyer suffered heart attack"
The Court further observed that the High Court had rightly taken suo moto cognisance and issued various directions including holding fresh elections on September 25, 2021.
 It also said that the directions that were issued by the High Court in paragraph 24 that dealt with mandatory conditions that were to be complied by a Member of Awadh Bar Association to participate in the election 2021 either for the purpose of contesting the election or casting his/her vote could not be faulted in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case since they were issued to maintain the purity of the election of the Bar Association.
 Reliance was also placed by the bench on paragraphs 16 to 19 of Top Court's judgement in R. Muthukrishnan Vs. Registrar General, High Court of Judicature at Madras, to emphasize on the importance of the Bar and the role to be played by the members of the Bar in the administration of justice delivery system and on paragraph 31 in which it was observed that there is no room for taking out the procession in the court premises or slogan raising in the courts. The Top Court in the aforesaid case had heavily criticised the misbehaviour of the advocates in the premises of Madras High Court which had resulted in requisitioning of CISF for maintaining safety and majesty of the Court and rule of law.
 Noting that the matter was sub judice before the High Court, the bench refrained from making further observations on the conduct of the advocates who misbehaved, pushed female lawyers and misbehaved with them.
 "We see no reason at all to interfere with the impugned orders, which as such is in furtherance of maintaining the purity of the election of the members of the Bar Association," Top Court observed.
 Case Before Allahabad High Court
 The Court while taking suo moto cognisance of the ruckus amid the Awadh Bar Association elections, had made it mandatory on August 24 that for a Member of Awadh Bar Association to participate in the election 2021 either for the purpose of contesting the election or casting his/her vote, among other conditions, had to be a regular practitioner of the High Court, Lucknow.
 It also attached an explanation so as to clarify who could be called a regular practitioner.
 To ease the procedure of election, the High Court on August 27 relaxed the conditions determining 'regular practitioner' of this Court (for the purpose of contesting the election or casting his/her vote) by modifying its earlier order (dated August 24) in the following manner:
 (I)The period of three years shall be reduced to two years. 
 (II)The minimum cases filed in a year for the last two years shall be ten cases for the year 2019 and 5 cases for the year 2020. 
 (III)The Lawyers whose houses are on Lucknow-Barabanki road or in the colonies on the Lucknow-Barabanki road shall be treated to be residents of Lucknow. 
 (IV)The Advocate-Oath Commissioners shall be treated to be 'regular practitioners'. 
 (V)All the Chamber allottees shall be included in the definition of 'regular practitioner'.

The Delhi High Court recently denied bail to a woman in a case concerning the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Act, after observing that there is a greater presumption being an educated person that carrying large quantities of narcotics is a crime.
Justice Subramonium Prasad said:
"An uneducated person may claim no knowledge of the substance found in his/her possession and may raise a defense of the substance being planted on them but being a highly educated person, there is greater presumption that carrying large quantities of narcotics is a crime and that it would entail consequences in law which could be harsh and irrevocable."
The Court refused to grant bail to one Sonia Shamrao Naik after opening that the quantity recovered from her was commercial quantity therefore the case could not fall within the twin parameters of Section 37 of the NDPS Act.
The woman was found to be in the possession of Methamphetamine, sample of which was verified by conducting a chemical test of the sample of the seized material.
"The disclosure statement has lead to the arrest of two Nigerian accused in whose possession narcotics was found. It has also been discovered by the NCB that these two accused were living illegally in India on fake passports. Material on record discloses that the petitioner is a part of a network which deals in supply/sale of Narcotics," the Court said.
"The clean & tidy track record of the Petitioner does not absolve her from being in possession of 600 Gms of Methamphetamine," it added.
The petitioner's bail plea was rejected by Special NDPS Judge, Patiala House Court in 2019 on the ground that she was caught with narcotics, in commercial quantity, at a Nizamuddin Railway Station.
The Court observed that the there was a prima facie case against her for the offences she was charged with and it appeared that she had been trafficking commercial quantity of narcotics.
"There appears to be a prima facie evidence that the Petitioner was in the possession of 600Gms of Methamphetamine at Nizamuddin Railway Station on 22.2.2018," the Court said.
Accordingly, the bail plea was dismissed.

The Calcutta High Court has recently commuted the sentence of life imprisonment awarded to a man convicted of raping a 7 year old girl after taking into account that the convict had no criminal antecedents and that he had already suffered incarceration for about 18 years. 
A Bench comprising Justice Bivas Pattanayak and Justice Joymalya Bagchi opined that although in the instant case a minor victim had been raped, the accused was also a young person who was barely above 18 years of age at the time of the incident. 
Commuting the life sentence imposed, the Bench observed, 
"Although, the victim was a minor and was forcibly raped, appellant was also a young person who was barely above 18 years at the time of occurrence. He does not have criminal antecedents. Keeping in mind the aforesaid facts and as he has already suffered incarceration for about 18 years, I modify the sentence imposed upon the appellant and direct that he shall suffer imprisonment for the period already undergone in place of the maximum sentence of life imprisonment imposed upon him and pay the fine imposed upon him by the trial Court, in default, shall suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year."
The Court further directed that the period of detention suffered by the appellant during investigation, enquiry and trial shall be set off from the substantive sentence imposed upon the appellant in terms of Section 428 of the CrPC. 
The instant appeal had been preferred against a judgement dated January 19, 2005 passed by the concerned trial Court convicting the appellant for commission of offence punishable under Section 376(2)(f) (rape on a woman when she is under twelve years of age) of the IPC. 
In the instant case, a police complaint had bee lodged by the father of the victim after the appellant had taken his minor daughter inside a tea garden and raped her. The complainant along with his wife and minor children had gone to his in-laws' house at Beech Tea Garden when this incident took place. The mother of the victim had rushed to the post after hearing the victim's cries and had found the victim in her under garments with bleeding injuries. 
Upon perusal of the record, the Court observed that the version of forcible rape as stated by the minor victim had been corroborated by her parents as well as local people. Furthermore, upholding the conviction, the Court opined, 
"Her evidence also receives corroboration from the medical evidence on record. Hence, conviction of the appellant has been proved beyond doubt."

The Supreme Court on Monday prohibited "Two-Finger Test" in rape cases and warned that persons conducting such tests will be held guilty of misconduct.
It is regrettable that "two-finger test" continues to be conducted even today, a bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and Hima Kohli lamented while restoring the conviction in a rape case.
"This court has time and again deprecated the use of two finger test in cases alleging rape and sexual assault. The so called test has no scientific basis. It instead re-victimises and re-traumatises women. The two finger test must not be conducted....The test is based on an incorrect assumption that a sexually active woman cannot be raped. Nothing can be further from the truth", the bench observed while pronouncing the judgment.
"The probative value of a woman's testimony does not depend on her sexual history. It is patriarchal and sexist to suggest that a woman cannot be believed when she states that she was raped merely because she is sexually active", the bench added.
The bench directed the Union Health Ministry to ensure that survivors of sexual assault and rape are not subject to two finger test. 
The Bench directed the Union Govt, as well as State Governments to ensure that the guidelines formulated by the Department of Health and Family Welfare (proscribes two finger test) are circulated to all Govt and private hospitals.
The Bench further directed to conduct workshops for health providers to communicate appropriate procedure examining survivor of sexual assault.
It also directed to review curriculums in medical schools so that the two finger test is not prescribed as one of the procedures to be adopted while examining survivors of sexual assault and rape.
The Court was deciding an appeal filed against a judgment of the Telangana High Court which overturned the conviction recorded by a trial court in a rape case.

The issue of whether a dying declaration recorded by the police is admissible must be decided after considering the facts and circumstances of each case - The fact that the dying declaration is not in the form of questions and answers does not impact either its admissibility or its probative value - There is no rule mandating the corroboration of the dying declaration through medical or other evidence, when the dying declaration is not otherwise suspicious.

In the judgment striking down Maratha quota as unconstitutional, a constitution bench of the Supreme Court observed that there is a rebuttable presumption that all communities and castes have marched towards advancement.
"We have completed more than 70 years of independence, all governments have been making efforts and taking measures for overall developments of all classes and communities. There is a presumption unless rebutted that all communities and castes have marched towards advancement", the lead judgment written by Justice Ashok Bhushan said(paragraph 327).
"We are constrained to observe that when more people aspire for backwardness instead of forwardness, the country itself stagnates which situation is not in accord with constitutional objectives", Justice Bhushan added in the judgment(paragraph 328).
The 5-judge bench, also comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat, held that there were no "exceptional circumstances" to justify the grant of reservation to Maratha community as a Socially and Economically Backward Class(SEBC) exceeding the ceiling limit of 50%.
Marathas dominant and forward class
The Court observed that "Marathas are dominant forward class and are in mainstream of National Life".
It also held that the fact that 85% of the population is backward is not a ground to breach the 50% limit.
Adequate Representation does not mean proportionate representation
After elaborately referring to statistics regarding the representation of Marathas in government jobs, the Court held that Marathas are adequately represented in services.
"The above representation of Marathas in public services in Grade-A, B, C and D are adequate and satisfactory. One community bagging such number of posts in public services is a matter of pride for the community and its representation in no manner can be said to not adequate in public services. The Constitutional pre-condition that backward class isnot adequately represented is not fulfilled. The State Government has formed opinion on the basis of the above figures submitted by the Gaikwad Commission. The opinion of the State Government being based on the report, not fulfilling the Constitutional requirement for granting reservation to Maratha community becomes unsustainable".
The Court held that there need not representation proportionate to the population of the community. What is required by the State for providing reservation under Article 16(4) is not proportionate representation but adequate representation. But the Gaikwad commission proceeded on the basis of proportionate representation.
"The constitutional precondition as mandated by Article 16(4) being not fulfilled with regard to Maratha class, both the Gaikwad Commission's report and consequential legislation are unsustainable. We thus hold that Maratha class was not entitled for any reservation under Article 16(4) and grant of reservation under Article 16(4) is unconstitutional and cannot be sustained", the Court held.
Marathas not socially or educationally backward
The Court said that the facts and figures which were obtained by the Commission itself indicate that students of Maratha community have succeeded in open competition and got admissions in all the streams including Engineering, Medical Graduation and Post-Graduation Courses and their percentage is not negligible. 
The Court also noted that in IAS, IPS and IFS ,percentage of Maratha out of the posts filled from open category candidates comes to 15.52, 27.85 and17.97 percentage respectively, "which is substantial representation of Marathas in prestigious Central services".
The Court held that the mere fact that the percentage of Marathas in engineering, medical, PG courses, higher academic posts and central services are not proportionate to their population is not indicative of their social and economic backwardness.
"...data and facts which have been collected by the Commission noted above clearly indicate that Marathas are neither socially nor educationally backward and the conclusion recorded by the Gaikwad Commission on the basis of its marking system, indicator and marking is not sufficient to conclude that Marathas are socially and educationally backward", 
the Court said.Reservation not the only form of affirmative action
The Court also suggested that it was time to think beyond reservations in public services as the only means of uplifting the weaker classes.
"Providing reservation for advancement of any socially and educationally backward class in public services is not the only means and method for improving the welfare of backward class. The State ought to bring other measures including providing educational facilities to the members of backward class free of cost, giving concession in fee, providing opportunities for skill development to enable the candidates from the backward class to be self-reliant", the Court said.
The bench also reiterated that the 50% ceiling limit on reservation was based on the principle of equality under Article 14 and refused to revisit the dictum laid down in the Indira Sawhney case.
"To change the 50% limit is to have a society which is not founded on equality but based on caste-rule. The democracy is an essential feature of our Constitution and part of our basic structure. If the reservation goes above 50% limit which is a reasonable, it will be slippery slope, the political pressure, make it hardly to reduce the same. Thus,answer to the question posed is that the percentage of 50% has been arrived at on the principle of reasonability and achieves equality as enshrined by Article 14 of which Articles 15 and 16 are facets", Justice Bhushan's judgment said.

The Gujarat High Court has granted anticipatory bail to four Directors and an employee of the Amos Corporation which is embroiled in the Hooch Tragedy of July 2022. 
600 litres of methyl alcohol was allegedly stolen from the company by one of its authorized personnel Jayesh Khavadiya and was eventually supplied to bootleggers. The spurious country made liquor had claimed 46 lives and injured 82.
The High Court observed that there is no overt act or illegal omission, which could be attributed to the applicants and they may not have been complicit with the said Jayesh. Bench of Justice Nikhil Kariel further observed that since the licence to deal with the product in question has been suspended/ cancelled, there is no likelihood of any repetition of the offences in question.
Significantly, the company had offered compensation of Rs. 2.20 crore to the victims' families. However, the Court made it clear that said factor has not weighed with it for grant of relief.
The applicants, being one Managing Director, three Directors and an employee of the company, are booked under three FIRs registered for offences under Sections 302, 328, 120B of IPC and 65(a) and 67-1A of Gujarat Prohibition Act. 
It was argued that invocation of Section 302 was incorrect since no such allegation was relatable to the activities of the MD. Similarly, Section 304 could not be invoked since the act was not committed with the intention of causing death. The Directors and MD were 'unnecessarily' apprehended since it had not been shown that they had knowledge that the act of sale of methyl alcohol would cause death, the counsel argued. Further Section 79 of the Prohibition Act which affixed vicarious liability was inapplicable since all due precaution was taken and the concerned employee was already in jail, it was submitted. Additionally, all relevant documentary evidence had been seized and no document remained with the Applicants.
 Per contra, the APP insisted that the offence alleged was in grave and there was no evidence that methyl alcohol was stolen from the factory premises or that the Applicants had taken any action against the theft. Further, there was a shortfall of around 2,600 ltrs of methyl alcohol comparing the quantity sent and quantity received from the Company. The Company's license clearly prohibited the use of methyl alcohol for making a beverage or mixing it with the beverage. It was also submitted that at this juncture, the investigation was open and the nature of charge against the Applicants was not yet discernible.
 Addressing the issue of Section 302, the High Court opined:
 "Insofar as the applicants are concerned, it prima facie appears to this Court that there is no material to allege commission of offence under Section 302 of IPC...It appears that the entire operation i.e. of calling the auto-rickshaw, loading auto-rickshaw, taking the material to the destination spot and handing over the material and taking the cash had been done by Jayesh."
 As regards the issue of Section 304, Justice Kariel explained:
 "It appears that while there is no overt act attributed to the present applicants done with the intention of causing death, even insofar as an omission of not doing any particular act is concerned, prima facie there does not appear to be any intention, which could be attributed to the present applicants."
 Regarding the applicability of Section 79 of the Prohibition Act, the Court said that vicarious liability did not envisage punishment of imprisonment to any person except the actual offender under the Act.
Aside from these aspects, Justice Kariel found no apprehension that the Applicants would tamper with the witnesses. Even as large number of deaths had been caused, it could not be said that the Applicants had committed any overt act to cause the same. Consequently, the High Court granted anticipatory bail to the Applicants on a personal bond of INR 1 lac each and with a surety of like amount.

The Supreme Court has observed that in the case of murder (u/s 302 IPC) it is expected for the High Court to at least give some reason for reversing Trial Court's order which had rejected bail application by reasoned order. The observation has been made by a bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Aniruddha Bose while considering SLP assailing Allahabad High Court's order dated August 2, 2021 of granting bail to accused in FIR registered u/s 302 IPC. The High Court while granting bail without giving any reason for grant of bail had said ("impugned order")
 "Keeping in view the nature of offence, evidence, complicity of the accused, severity of the punishment, submissions of learned counsel for the parties and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, this Court is of the view that the applicant is entitled to be enlarged on bail during the pendency of the trial". The appeal was preferred by the deceased's brother. The Top Court while setting aside the order said,
 "On perusal of the impugned orders, what is noteworthy is that in the impugned orders passed by the High Court no reason has been given for grant of bail. In the case of murder (under Section 302 IPC), it is expected that at least some reason would be given while reversing the order of the Trial Court, which had rejected the bail application by a reasoned order. In the present case, the nature of the offence is very grave i.e. murder under Section 302 IPC and if such reasons are to be accepted for granting bail, then probably in all cases bail would be granted." The bench further directed the Trial Court to expedite the trial and make every endeavour to conclude it within eight months from the receipt of copy of the order. The court also asked the appellants to not seek any adjournment before the Trial Court. It also granted respondent liberty to file a fresh application for bail before the Trial Court on court's failure to conclude the trial within 8 months.

The Madras High Court has recently held that an order of Magistrate directing to register FIR cannot be quashed merely in the absence of recoding reasons on how the Magistrate was satisfied about the prima facie case.
 Justice RN Manjula held that only when a mechanical order is passed on a bald complaint, the same can be set aside for not listing out the reasons. 
 Though it is correct to state that the Court has to record the reasons basing on the allegations how it got satisfied about the prima facie case, that would benefit the petitioner only if the complaint given by the second respondent is bald and the learned Magistrate has mechanically passed an order to register an FIR without appreciating the baldness in the complaint.
 The court added that though it would have been better if the Metropolitan Magistrate had recorded reasons, it could not be the reason to set aside the order when the complaint contained material particulars. Thus, it could be said that the order was passed without application of mind.
 Had it recorded the reasons as to why the Court got satisfied about the prima facie case that could have been a better order, but that cannot be the reason to set aside the order even when the complaint contains the material particulars. Hence it cannot be said that the order has been passed without application of mind.
 In the present case, the de facto complainant was working in the petitioner’s firm when the petitioner approached her in an inappropriate and unsolicited manner. The petitioner was in the habit of sexually coloured messages and tried to make physical closeness with her. At one instance, when she did not respond to his demands, the de facto complainant was dismissed from the company. Thus, a petition was filed under Section 156(3) before the Magistrate. The magistrate was also informed that the police had failed to take any action on her complaint.
 The petitioner countered the allegations by submitting that the de facto complainant had misappropriate the company’s fund by abusing her position and issuing fake vouchers and falsified the accounts. After a complaint was lodged, the present complaint was filed as a counter blast. The petitioner also contended that the impugned order was a cryptic one and did not speak about any justification for directing the registration of FIR.
 The petitioner also questioned the veracity of the complaint by submitting that the complainant continued to be in service even after alleging sexual harassment. It was submitted that if the harassment was true, she would not have continued her service. 
 The court noted that the motive alleged can be put to test only when a detailed investigation is made. In the present case, it was premature to come to any conclusion based on the materials at the current stage. Since the materials disclosed a cognisable offence, the court noted that it was right for the Magistrate to order the registration of FIR.
 The court added that if after conclusion of investigation, no sufficient materials were collected or if the complaint was found to be a motivated one, the petitioner was at liberty to initiate appropriate proceedings.

In a recent judgment, the Kerala High Court expressed concerns that the consumerist culture of 'use and throw' has affected matrimonial relationships. The Court lamented that the younger generation is seeing marraige as an "evil", which has to be avoided to "enjoy free life" and that live-in relationships are on the rise.
Remarking upon the sanctity that the institution of marriage has been attributed with, the Division Bench composed of Justice A. Muhammed Mustaque and Justice Sophy Thomas, observed as follows
"Kerala, known as God's own Country, was once famous for its well knit family bondage. But the present trend it seems to break the nuptial tie on flimsy or selfish reasons, or for extra-marital relationships, even unmindful of their children. The wails and screams coming out of disturbed and destroyed families are liable to shake the conscience of the society as a whole. When warring couples, deserted children and desperate divorcees occupy the majority of our population, no doubt it will adversely affect the tranquility of our social life, and our society will have a stunted growth".
Particularly emphasizing upon the younger generations' views on marriage, the Court noted that, 
"Now-a-days, the younger generation think that marriage is an evil that could be avoided to enjoy free life without any liabilities or obligations. They would expand the word 'WIFE' as 'Worry Invited For Ever' substituting the old concept of 'Wise Investment For Ever'. The consumer culture of 'use and throw' seems to have influenced our matrimonial relationships also. Live-in-relationships are on the rise, just to say good-bye when they fell apart".
The judgment authored by Justice Sophy Thomas was delivered in a matrimonial appeal filed by a husband seeking divorce.
According to the factual matrix of the case, the husband had filed an OP (Divorce) before the Family Court, at Alappuzha, on the ground of matrimonial cruelty. The couple who had married as per Christian rites, and had three daughters, were living in Saudi Arabia. It was submitted by the appellant/petitioner, represented by Advocates  Mathew Kuriakose, J. Krishnakumar, and Moni George, that his wife developed some behavioural abnormalities and picked up quarrels with him alleging that he had illicit relationship with other women. It was alleged by him that due to this abusive and violent behaviour of the respondent-wife, he became mentally stressed and physically ill, and hence, filed the petition for divorce. 
The respondent however, represented by Advocates J. John Prakash, P. Pramel, Nimmi Shaji, and Balasubramaniam R., contended that the appellant was merely concocting reasons to keep himself away, and that she never displayed any cruelty, nor had she ever physically assaulted or threatened him, as per his allegations. 
The Court at this juncture could not concede to the appellant's submissions that the behaviour of the wife amounted to matrimonial cruelty, and observed, 
"When the wife had reasonable grounds to suspect the chastity or fidelity of her husband, and if she questions him, or expresses her deep pain and sorrow before him, it cannot be termed as a behavioural abnormality, as it is the natural human conduct of a normal wife. The normal human reactions or responses from a wife, on knowing that her husband was having illicit connection with another lady, cannot be termed as behavioural abnormality or cruelty from the part of the wife, so as to dissolve their marriage".
It was relying upon the testimonies of the witnesses produced, including the mother of the appellant, that the court arrived at its observation. 
It was added that the Courts of the land "could not come to the aid of an erring person to legalise his activities, which are per se illegal". Hence, it was observed that if the husband had indeed, developed an illicit relationship with another woman, he could not rely upon the Courts of the land to come to his aid by dissolving his legally solemnized marriage.
Importantly, it was observed by the Court that in order to amount to 'cruelty' to amount to ground of divorce under Section 10 (1)(X) of the Divorce Act, the appellant would have to establish that since the solemnisation of the marriage, the respondent has treated him with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in his mind that it would be harmful or injurious for him to live with the respondent. 
"Mere quarrels, ordinary wear and tear of matrimonial relationships or casual outburst of some emotional feelings cannot be treated as cruelties warranting a divorce", it was observed.
It was in this light that the court observed that in the instant case, the factual situation clearly showed that the appellant had developed an 'unholy alliance' with another lady, which caused disturbances in their family life, and hence, no such matrimonial cruelty, as able to cause a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the appellant that it would be harmful or injurious for him to live with the respondent was proved by the appellant. In such circumstances, the Court did not find cause to interfere with the finding of the Family Court, Alappuzha that the appellant was not entitled to decree of divorce on the ground of matrimonial cruelty, and the appeal, was thus, dismissed.

The Delhi High Court recently allowed the regular bail application of a man, co-accused in a criminal case filed against rape of a US national.
 A Single Bench of Justice Anu Malhotra allowed the bail plea after it was informed that the prosecutrix has refused to pursue the matter any further.
 The Bench observed that counsel for the prosecutrix, appointed by the Trial Court, had sought discharge in the matter in as much as the Attorney in the US Department of Justice had informed her that the prosecutrix does not seek to pursue with the matter any more.
 The State Government had also told the Court that it is in receipt of some emails forwarded by the Ministry of Home Affairs, which it received from the Consulate General of India, Chicago and the US Department of Justice, informing that the prosecutrix no longer wished to provide testimony or to have any further involvement in the matter, and she had asked not to be contacted about this matter again by the Indian authorities for any reason.
 The FIR lodged at Safdarjung Enclave Police Station under Sections 376D (intercourse by management/ staff of a hospital with any woman in that hospital) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC named two men—Shamim and Amit Balguhar (Applicant) in the alleged rape of the prosecutrix on 2nd September, 2017 during her visit to India. 
 Whereas Shamim is already out on interim bail, Balguhar had sought bail on the ground that his child is suffering from abdominal TB. The State had also vouched for the correctness of the documents that were submitted by the Applicant qua the ailment of his child.
 Taking note of totality of the circumstances, the Court said that the accused is entitled to bail subject to furnishing a personal bond of Rs.1 lac with two sureties of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court.
 Advocates Akshai Malik and Khawar Saleem appeared for the petitioner/accused.

The Gujarat High Court has recently observed that normally, Courts would be loath to interfere in contractual matters unless a clear-cut case of arbitrariness or malafides or bias or irrationality is made out. 
A bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Shastri observed that needless interference in commercial matters can cause havoc and hence, the Courts must realize their limitations in such matters.
"But, at the same time, it is also the proposition of law that Constitutional Court being the guardian of the fundamental rights, is duty bound to interfere when there is arbitrariness, irrationality, malafides and bias and as such, a duty is cast upon the Court in such circumstances that whenever any specific arbitrariness or irrationality is visible in public interest, Court can exercise powers of judicial review," it added.
This significant observation was made in a petition under Article 226, seeking to quash a communication dated 23.03.22 which declared the action of the Respondent holding the Petitioner's bid to be invalid. 
The Petitioners sought that the Court declare the Petitioner's bid to be valid, responsive and entitled for consideration in respect of the pertinent tender and also prohibit the Respondent from issuing any Letters of Acceptance to any other bidders for the same tender.
 The Petitioner herein, a registered vendor to public organisations for the past several years, had bid for the tender floated by the Respondent for procuring aluminium wound, amorphous core distribution transformers with BIS marking and certification. The total quantity of the transformers required was changed and the last date for submission of online bid was extended. However, the Petitioner claimed that it was not informed about the new date for opening the technical and price bids by the authority. 
Subsequently, there was a similar tender floated by the Respondent for procuring copper wound but through a corrigendum, the quantity required and the deadline for submission of bids were revised. Yet again, per the Petitioner claimed that the revised dates were not informed to the Petitioner. Even though the Petitioner qualified the preliminary round of scrutiny, its bid was rejected since the Petitioner had lapsed in uploading a few documents and it had not communicated the names of new Directors. 
This communication declaring the Petitioner's bid as invalid was challenged by the Petitioner by mentioning that the change of directors was already informed to the Respondent earlier. It was the Petitioner's allegation that the Respondents had created a 'new theory' of lack of documents to reject the Petitioner's bid. It was also submitted that the Petitioner was undertaking the work of supplying transformers to the Respondent arising from the Letter of Acceptance and the Respondent was aware of the authority of the directors. Therefore, the impugned communication was 'arbitrary, illegal and perverse.'
 The Respondent opposed the petition stating that in contractual matters, the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be exercised which was a settled proposition of law. Further, the Petitioner was aware of the terms and conditions of the tender and about the disqualification clause, as well. Therefore, it cannot raise the grievance about the non-assigning of a detailed reason for disqualification. The change of directors 'substantially altered the control of the firm' which, per the Respondent, should have been brought to their notice.
 The Bench noted that the Petitioner had clearly communicated to the Respondent authority on 19.09.2021 about the change of directors but the only issue was that the Petitioners had not informed of the change telephonically. Further, the Respondent had been in business with the Petitioner with regard to another agreement and yet under the guise of lack of information about the directors, rejected the instant bid of the Petitioner. The High Court also rejected the averment that there was a material change of ownership because of the change in directors in the Petitioner firm.
 While accepting the position that Constitutional courts cannot be expected to interpret or modify the terms of the tender but on the basis of material, the High Court cautioned that if the decision-making process is found to be 'somewhat unfair', reflects 'clear arbitrariness and unreasonableness', the Court cannot shut its eyes to such processes particularly, where the work relates to public importance. 
Opining that the decision-making process was not 'germane to law', the High Court placed reliance on Silppi Constructions Contractors Vs. Union of India and Another to conclude that Courts must give fair play in the joint sector undertakings of the Government in matters of contract. However, the Courts must not interfere where such interference will cause unnecessary loss to public exchequer.
 Similarly, the High Court emphasised the 'enlarged role' of the Government in economic activity and how the PIL jurisdiction can be invoked is there is arbitrariness, violation of fair play or whimsicalness in the tender contracts (Uflex Limited Vs. Government of Tamil Nadu and others).
 Owing to these precedents and reasons, the High Court allowed the petition and directed that the Respondents consider the Petitioner's bid with gravity and take an appropriate decision at the earliest. The High Court cautioned that no opinion with regard to merits was passed and that the Respondent is at liberty to take decision on merits as per the tender terms and conditions.
 Case Title: SUMESH ENGINEERS PRIVATE LIMITED v/s MADHYA GUJARAT VIJ COMPANY LIMITED

'Non-payment of dues, the delays in project completion, and not paying transit rent for months together speaks to an inherent, and constantly growing, social injustice'In a judgement that lays bare the reality of 'redevelopment' in Mumbai, the Bombay High court has held that even the slightest delay in project completion or payment in rent is sufficient to warrant the termination of a developer's contact.
 A single bench of Justice Gautam Patel has observed that in matters of redevelopment, which are in the realm of private law, there is no such thing as 'substantial compliance.'
 The slightest delay in project completion, unless specifically accepted by the society, and even one single default in payment of transit rent or other dues is actually sufficient to warrant a termination. There is no such thing in these matters as 'substantial compliance'. That is not the principle of obligations in the realm of private law.
 The Case
 The court was hearing a petition by Rajawadi Arunodaya Co-op Housing Society Ltd. from Ghatkopar (east) under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act for interim reliefs before the arbitral proceedings begin, regarding a six-year delay in completion of the project and non-payment of rent by developer Value Projects Pvt Ltd. 
 The original building with 20 residential and seven commercial units was built before 1985 on 1000 sq meters of land. The Society entered into a deed of redevelopment on April 5, 2013, and handed over vacant possession of their flats in 2015. However, a severe default in rent and contractual obligation by the developer, including the creation of third-party rights compelled them to terminate the contract in 2019 and approach the High Court, last year. 
 Justice Patel has granted a mandatory injunction to the society and ordered the developer to hand over peaceful possession of the property by April 19, appointed a Court Receiver who remain in symbolic possession until completion of the project and also appointed an arbitrator to decide the disputes between the society and developer arising out of the 2013 contract. 
 The developer's petition for interim reliefs, a status-quo so that his investment remained protected, was dismissed. "This order is not a final determination of the developer's final contentions or claims. It may in arbitration seek suitable reliefs," Justice Patel held.
 Observations
 Justice Patel observed that re-development involves a very real issue of human displacement and an associated trauma caused to an entire community by the delay in project completion. Where people who have lived together for generations suddenly lose contact forever. 
 This is what has been lost in translation. This is what delayed redevelopment projects do not begin to let us understand. There is a very real human tragedy unfolding in case after case, and it is tearing apart the social fabric of this city. It is all very easy to say in a Court of law that "arrears of transit rent" have not been paid. What does this actually mean? Digits and commas on a page in a lawsuit do not let us comprehend the terrifying reality of what that non-payment of rent month after month after month must mean to ordinary middle-income people."
 Describing a typical middle-class community, with its open-doors and families celebrating festivals together, Justice Patel observes that "development" in a dryly-worded contract, does not tell us what has happened — that this community has been literally splintered and torn apart. The contact that has persisted through generations has almost certainly been lost.
 This city is really nothing but an agglomeration of these communities [Maharashtrian, Gujarati, Tamil, Kannada, Parsi or otherwise] working together.
 He ruled that the balance of convenience would lie in the society's favour, as a development project would be a gamble for a developer but a matter of survival for a society. 
 The hardship to the members is real and immediate; the so-called hardship to the Developers is notional. When it spent in the project, this was no altruism or charity…The Developer gambled on the project. Receiving monthly rent is not a sop, not a matter of 'convenience'. It is a matter of survival. Therefore, the non-payment of dues, the delays in project completion, and not paying transit rent for months together speaks to an inherent, and constantly growing, social injustice.
 Justice Patel said that there are different categories in re-development cases. However, in a case where the developer has left the job mid-way and the society comes to court for termination, the developer must bring forward a proposal covering, (i) accumulated arrears of transit rent and other dues; (ii) the obligation to pay ongoing transit rent until possession with an occupation certificate; (iii) payment of statutory and corporation dues, including property tax and (iv) a demonstration of the financial means to bring the project to completion.
 And in its absence, be ready for termination of the contract, ejectment from site and liability to pay all the accumulated debts.

Quashing a detention order the Jammu and Kashmir & Ladakh High Court recently held that using the same grounds and material for passing a subsequent detention order without actually mentioning that the detenue had already been detained on the basis of this very material, not only amounts to an illegality but also shows lack of application of mind on part of the detaining authority.
The observations were made by Justice Sanjay Dhar while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had challenged a detention order whereby he had been placed under preventive detention in order to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security, sovereignty and integrity of the State.
The petitioner premised his plea inter alia on the ground that the Statutory procedural safeguards had not been complied with in the instant case as whole of the material that formed basis of the grounds of detention and the consequent order of detention has not been provided to the detenue and that there has been total non-application of mind on the part of the detaining authority while passing the impugned detention order.
Contesting the plea the respondents justified the passing of the order by contending that the detenue was a habitual criminal, inasmuch as there were various FIRs pending against him and on this basis, the Detaining Authority was well within its jurisdiction to pass the impugned order of detention as there was every likelihood of the detenue indulging in similar activities.
Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Dhar observed that the execution report, which forms part of the detention record suggests that the copy of the police dossier has not at all been supplied to the detenue. 
The bench also noted that the grounds of detention had made reference to three FIRs, i.e., FIR Nos.183/2016, 191/2016 and 313/2017 and it was incumbent upon the respondents to furnish not only the copy of these FIRs but also the statements of witnesses recorded during investigation of these FIRs and other material on the basis of which petitioner’s involvement in the said FIRs was shown. 
Deliberating on the contention of the petitioner that the impugned order of detention had been passed on the basis of stale incidents having no proximate link with the activities alleged to be prejudicial to the security, sovereignty and integrity of the State, the bench noted that grounds of detention revealed that the incidents referred therein pertain to the year 2016, 2017 and 2018, that is more than six years, five years and four years respectively prior to the passing of impugned order of detention. 
"In fact, the incidents and FIRs which formed basis of the grounds of detention have been the basis of earlier detention of petitioner which was made in terms of order No.19/DMK/PSA/2018 dated 04.10.218, which has been quashed by this Court while disposing of HCP No.363/2018", the bench recorded. 
Pointing out towards the illegality in the detention order the bench explained that using the same grounds and material for passing subsequent detention order without actually mentioning that the petitioner had been previously detained on the basis of this very material clearly suggests non application of mind on the part of detaining authority and hence renders the same unsustainable. 
While allowing the petition, the court directed immediate release of the detenu provided he is not required in any other case. 
Case Title: Khalid Nazir Wagay Vs UT of J&K 
Coram: Justice Sanjay Dhar 

The Orissa High Court has held that entitlement of an employee or an ex-employee to his salary or pension, as the case may be, is an intrinsic part of his right to life under Article 21 and right to property under Article 300A of the Constitution.
 While allowing payment of interest on the arrears of a retired government employee, a Single Bench of Justice Sanjeeb Kumar Panigrahi observed,
 "Moreover, the employees cannot be allowed to suffer because of inaction on the part of the employer for no fault of the employees. The employee is definitely entitled to get the payment as per the service conditions on due dates and/or in a given case within reasonable time. The employees, had the payment received within time and/or on due dates, could have utilised the same for various purposes."
 Factual Background:
 The petitioner joined service as the Headmaster in Panchayat High School, Chandanbhati, in the district of Bolangir, which was a non-government aided educational institution. However, the school was taken over by the Government with effect from 07.06.1994 and, thus, the petitioner was rendering his services as a government servant till his superannuation on 28.02.2001.
 It was submitted on behalf of the petitioner that being a 74-year-old man, he was made to run from pillar to post to get his legitimate dues but owing to administrative latches, the same could not materialize. Therefore, it was claimed, the redressal of grievance of the petitioner would remain incomplete if he were to be denied of the interest component that is payable to him as a result of delay.
 The grievance of the petitioner, insofar as payment of arrears was concerned, had already been redressed but the interest component of the amount which had been held up for the last twenty-one years, was required to be paid. Hence, he filed this petition.
 Court's Observations:
 The Court, at the outset, observed that it is well-settled that salaries and pensions are due as a matter of right to employees and also to the former employees who have served the State. Since, the petitioner rendered his services till superannuation as a government servant, his entitlement to the payment of salary is intrinsic to the right to life under Article 21 and to right to property which is recognized by Article 300A of the Constitution.
 The Court then quoted the Apex Court, which in the case of State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr v. Smt. Dinavahi Lakshmi Kameswari, held, 
 "The direction for the payment of the deferred portions of the salaries and pensions is unexceptionable. Salaries are due to the employees of the State for services rendered. Salaries in other words constitute the rightful entitlement of the employees and are payable in accordance with law. Likewise, it is well settled that the payment of pension is for years of past service rendered by the pensioners to the State. Pensions are hence a matter of a rightful entitlement recognised by the applicable rules and regulations which govern the service of the employees of the State."
 It then acknowledged that the payment in favour of the petitioner was withheld for insufficient reasons. There was no material justification to take such time for fixing arrears of the petitioner. On this undisputed position, the court did not incline to accept the submissions of the Opposite Party regarding non-payment of interest due to absence of any specific provisions in the service conditions. 
 Further, it held that the late decision taken by the opposite party is attributable to administrative latches across different levels and the same cannot be the reason to withhold the payment to the employees who admittedly worked at the relevant time. It stressed, the fact remains that there was delay in making payment of arrears of salary and other benefits, thus, with or without intention, is immaterial. In view of the admitted position on record that the payment was not made on due dates according to service conditions, there is no disputed question of facts involved, it added. 
 The Court then cited D.D. Tewari v. Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited & Ors., wherein the Supreme Court held that denial of interest from the date of entitlement till the date of actual disbursement would take away the valuable rights of the retired government servant. It was reiterated in that decision that pension and gratuity are not bounty to be distributed by the government to its employees on their retirement, but are valuable rights and property in its hands and any culpable delay in settlement and disbursement thereof is to be visited with penalty of payment of interest.
 The court formed the considered opinion that as there was a delay in the payment of arrears of salary for which the petitioner was not at all responsible, he is entitled to the interest on the delayed payment. Because of the administrative latches, there was a delay in the payment of arrears of salary and/or settling the dues and hence, the retired employee should not be made to suffer for no fault of his, it held.
 Applying the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in various cases to the facts of this case, the Court observed, there was a delay of about 21 years in settling the salary arrears payable to the petitioner. Even after multiple representations to the opposite party, the petitioner's claim was not entertained, owing to the callous attitude of the opposite party. Therefore, the Court held that the delay on the part of the opposite party in settling the arrears of salary payable to the petitioner for about 21 years purportedly due to administrative latches cannot be accepted. It lamented,
 "The present case is a clear example of inexcusable departmental delay. Even if it is assumed that the representations made by the petitioner were actively catered to, this cannot be an excuse for lethargy of the department because rules/instructions provide for initiation of process much before retirement. The exercise which was to be completed much before retirement was in fact started long after petitioner's retirement."
 Consequently, the Court, having regard for the decision of the Supreme Court in State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr v. Smt. Dinavahi Lakshmi Kameswari (supra), directed the State to pay simple interest to the petitioner, computed at the rate of 6% per annum on account of deferred salaries within a period of 30 days from the date of the order.
 Accordingly, the petition was allowed.

The Supreme Court has observed that a long delay in lodging FIR can be a valid consideration for grant of anticipatory bail.
The bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan observed thus while allowing the anticipatory bail plea of former Director General of Police (DGP), Punjab, Sumedh Singh Saini who had sought the bail relation to the 1991 Balwant Singh Multani murder case.
"However, considering the fact that the impugned FIR has been lodged/filed by the brother of the deceased after a period of almost 29 years from the date of incident and after a period of 9 years from the date of decision of this Court in the case of Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar (supra) and nothing is on record that in between he had taken any steps to initiate criminal proceedings and/or lodged an FIR, we are of the opinion that at 11 least a case is made out by the appellant for grant of anticipatory bail under Section 438, Cr.P.C. Many a time, delay may not be fatal to the criminal proceedings. However, it always depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. However, at the same time, a long delay like 29 years as in the present case can certainly be a valid consideration for grant of anticipatory bail.", the bench also comprising Justices R. Subhash Reddy and MR Shah observed.
The FIR alleged that Balwant Singh Multani was killed in State-managed elimination around the month of December 1991. Allegedly, during the tenure of Sumedh Singh Saini as SSP, Chandigarh on the early morning of 11.12.1991 the police of Chandigarh swooped upon the residence of the deceased and took him away forcibly and illegally without assigning any reason.
The Punjab and Haryana High Court had dismissed his application seeking anticipatory bail. In appeal before the Apex Court, Saini contended that the present FIR is filed with a malafide intention to harass him at the instance of the present party in power in the State. It was submitted that the present FIR is not maintainable as being a second FIR on the same set of facts and has been registered after delay of 29 years of the alleged incident.
The court noted that whether the fresh/present proceedings are permissible in law are yet to be considered by this Court in the pending proceedings for quashing the impugned FIR.  While granting him anticipatory bail, the bench observed:
"Looking to the status of the appellant and it is reported that he has retired in the year 2018 as Director General of Police, Punjab after 30 years of service and the alleged incident is of the year 1991 and even in the present FIR initially there was no allegation for the offence under Section 302 IPC and the allegations were only for the offences under Sections 364, 201, 344, 330, 219 and 120­B of the IPC, for which there was an order of anticipatory bail in favour of the appellant and subsequently the offence under Section 302 IPC has been added on the basis of the statements of Jagir Singh and Kuldip Singh – approvers only, we are of the opinion that the appellant has made out a case for anticipatory bail."

The Kerala High Court has ruled that sanction stipulated under Section 197 Code of Criminal Procedure is not necessary to prosecute police officers in cases of police brutality since such acts are not related in any manner to the discharge of their official duties.
Justice Mary Joseph remarked:
"...the accused can only be taken to have exercised their authority for committing some illegal acts, under the guise of exercise of lawful discharge of their official duties and therefore are not liable to be afforded with the protection envisaged under Section 197. Sanction contemplated under the above provision is not intended to safeguard illegal acts."
The Court added that sanction as a protective measure was incorporated in CrPC to save a public servant acting in bonafide without exceeding the jurisdictional limits and also duly exercising the authority recognized by law:
"What is intended by the incorporation of Section 197 in Cr.P.C is an assurance to a public servant that for whatever things bonafide done by him in the lawful exercise of the authority conferred on him, protection would be afforded to him."
Background:
The petitioners herein were police officers of the Ezhukone Police Station. They were accused of brutally assaulting a man in custody causing inter alia cigarette burns on his tongue, making him unable to speak when produced before the Magistrate.  
The injured complainant had narrated gory details of the assault inflicted on him by the accused police officers.
The Judicial First Class Magistrate, Kottarakaram found them guilty and passed an order of conviction against them for offences punishable under Sections 323 and 324 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The appellate court confirmed this conviction.
The revision petition was preferred on the primary contention that despite being public servants cognizance was taken by the trial court and they were prosecuted without getting the sanction from the State Government as contemplated under Section 197 CrPC. and therefore, the process of taking cognizance and conduct of the trial is vitiated. 
Both the trial court and the appellant court had taken the view that sanction, as contemplated under Section 197 CrPC, is unwarranted in the case on hand since the acts alleged to have been committed by the accused are not related in any manner to the discharge of their official duties. 
Observations:
The Court opined that the sanction contemplated under Section 197 was not meant to protect a public servant dealing with the life or personal liberty of a man out of the purview of law or procedure established by law. Therefore, a policeman had to act within the limits of the legal domain recognized by the Code or any other enactments. 
"For the mere reason that the Policemen arrived there in a Departmental vehicle during hours of their official duty, and took the complainant along with them to the Police Station, it cannot be said that, they were discharging their official duties. There must be some legal basis while depriving the personal liberty of a person, since it being the mandate of our Constitution under Article 21 that a person's life or liberty shall not only be curtailed or abridged without the support of a procedure established by law."
The Court further noted that the accused cannot take the advantage of Section 197 after committing mischievous acts under the guise of lawful discharge of official duties. 
"The fact that the incident occurred within the Police Station and during the course of discharge of official duty by the Policemen will not legalise it if it turns out as an exercise of excess power by them for illegal gain."
Therefore, the Bench held that sanction is absolutely unwarranted in the context of taking cognizance of the offence against the accused and prosecuting them.
"This Court ... was convinced that the injuries inflicted were of barbarous nature and unwarranted by the circumstances that exist at the relevant time, for discharging the official duty by them as Policemen. The context being so, sanction, as contemplated under Section 197 CrPC, cannot be a precondition for taking cognizance of the offences against the accused and for prosecuting them. The trial court undoubtedly is justified in holding so and this Court finds no reason to interfere with that finding."
In the light of the foregoing discussions, the High Court held that the trial and the appellate courts were not in error and were perfectly justified in finding the accused guilty for the offences under Sections 323 and 324 read with Section 34 IPC, convicting them and imposing punishments on them for those by the impugned judgment.
Accordingly, the revision petitions were dismissed. 
Senior Advocate K Gopalakrishna Kurup and Advocate S. Rajeev appeared for the petitioners in the matter while Public Prosecutor E.C. Bineesh represented the State.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently allowed the appeal by the husband against the order of the Trial Court wherein his petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (HMA) for dissolution of marriage was dismissed.
The bench comprising Justice Meenakshi I Mehta held that the respondent-wife has subjected the petitioner to cruelty hence, it would be impossible for the petitioner to live with her anymore.
 The court further observed that facts and circumstances unequivocally suggest that the wife has incessantly been filing the complaints against the petitioner and his family members that led to petitioner's arrest and he had to go behind the bars. This all has resulted in harm/damage to his image and reputation in the eyes of their relatives and the society at large.
 The above-discussed facts and circumstances unequivocally speak volumes of the fact that the respondent has incessantly been filing the complaints against the petitioner as well as his family members and the petitioner even had to go behind the bars in connection with one of those complaints, resulting in harm/damage to his image and reputation in the eyes of their relatives and the society at large.
 The petitioner alleged that the respondent-wife used to quarrel over petty matters, frequently threatened to commit suicide, and even threatened to involve him in some false complaint/case. He claimed that she lodged a complaint with the Crime Against Women Cell against him, his mother and sister as well as his uncle but later-on, she made a statement before the police authorities to the effect that she did not want to pursue her complaint further.
Subsequently, it is alleged that the respondent again submitted a complaint against him and his family members there also and in pursuance of the same, the police arrested him by invoking the provisions of Sections 107/151 CrPC. However, the respondent did not make any statement before the said Authority and finally, he was discharged in the said proceedings. Even thereafter, it is alleged that the respondent kept on moving false complaints against him and his family members at Crime Against Women Cell.
Court placed reliance on Apex Court's judgement in Joydeep Majumdar v. Bharti Jaiswal Majumdar 2021 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 289 and held that the respondent has subjected the petitioner to cruelty after their marriage.
 The present case is squarely covered by the above-discussed observations and in the light of the same, it is held that the respondent has subjected the petitioner to cruelty after their marriage. 
 Even otherwise, the court noted that the parties are living separately for the last 7 years and therefore, their marriage can be termed as a "dead marriage".
As a sequel to the foregoing discussion, the court allowed the present appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and decree passed by the trial Court.
 Furthermore, the court allowed the petition filed by the petitioner-husband under Section 13 of the Act and dissolved the marriage between the parties under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.

Punjab and Haryana High Court on April 28, 2022, while dealing with a revision petition, held that it is well-settled law that in light of statutory provisions under Section 41(h) of the Specific Relief Act, where a more efficacious remedy is available, the party is under a legal obligation to opt for that remedy. The bench comprising Justice Fateh Deep Singh appreciated the submissions of the counsel that the husband is trying to seek a mere declaration and mandatory injunction with consequential relief of permanent injunction on the ground that judgment and order passed in an application under Section 125 CrPC is an outcome of fraud and so the other petitions under the cruelty, maintenance, alteration in the maintenance allowance and proceedings under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 are misuse of the process of Court. Appreciating the submissions of the counsel, what the husband is trying to seek in the suit (Annexure P5) is a mere declaration and mandatory injunction with consequential relief of permanent injunction for a decree that judgment and order dated 26.08.2010 is an outcome of fraud and so the other petitions under the cruelty to married women; maintenance and alteration in the maintenance allowance including proceedings under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 have been termed to be the misuse of the process of Court. The battle between the petitioner-husband and respondent-wife did not subside even after divorce and proceedings under Section 127 Cr.P.C. were invoked by the petitioner-husband along with the present revision petition challenging the orders rejecting application for grant of a temporary injunction against the respondent-wife. The court noted that by the judgment and order dated 26.08.2010, maintenance allowance has been granted to the wife and the minor child and under the relevant provisions of Cr.P.C., only a revision lies under Section 397, 398, and 399 Cr.P.C. which has not been brought to the notice of this Court, therefore mere challenge to a finding in a civil suit is not permissible in light of the well-settled principles of law that provide that recourse has to be laid to the provisions enshrined under the law. The judgment and order dated 26.08.2010 (Annexure P11) is passed in an application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. for grant of maintenance allowance whereby maintenance allowance has been granted to the wife and the minor child by the Court of learned District Judge, Family Court, Faridabad. Under the relevant provisions of Cr.P.C., only a revision lies under Section 397, 398 and 399 Cr.P.C. and which has not been assailed of nor brought to the notice of this Court by learned counsel for the petitioner and therefore, mere challenging such a finding in a civil suit certainly is not permissible in view of the well-enunciated law that recourse has to be laid to the provisions enshrined under the law and since the statute provides a remedy to challenge this order, the same needs to be followed which the petitioner has failed to do so. By virtue of the order dated 31.05.2018, an ad-interim injunction was sought in this suit which was declined because there is a specific remedy under Order 42 CPC which has never been assailed of. Moreover, to seek enforcement and grant of maintenance, provisions of Chapter IX have been laid down under Cr. P.C that needed to be followed by the petitioner which he did not. Thus, in the light of well-settled law and the statutory provisions under Section 41(h) of the Specific Relief Act, the party is under a legal obligation to choose the more efficacious remedy available there. 
The Punjab and Haryana High Court has granted bail to a man, allegedly found in conscious possession of 500 kgs of poppy husk without any licence, after three years of custody as an undertrial.
Justice Pankaj Jain observed,
"Right to speedy trial is one of the objectives of NDPS Act and is rather one of the checks and balances provided under the Act. Section 36 NDPS Act recognizes the need for speedy trial. The provision contained in Section 36 providing for constitution of Special Courts is a means to achieve the end objective of speedy trial. Section 36 well recognizes the need for speedy trial."
The Petitioner, in custody since November 2019, sought regular bail in connection with the FIR registered against him for the offences punishable under Sections 15(c) and 27(a) of the NDPS Act. He submitted that he has been behind the bars for around three years and the trial had not progressed for over a year and a half, given that there were 18 witnesses in the matter and none had been examined.
 As per the petitioner, even though he was caught with commercial quantity contraband, Section 37 of the NDPS Act (which provides for non-bailable offences) was still subservient to the guarantee under Article 21, which guarantee was also recognized by the NDPS Act itself.
 The petitioner relied on Supreme Court's decision in Shariful Islam @ Sarif v. State of West Bengal, to establish that undertrials under NDPS Act are entitled to regular bail despite custody under Section 37. Reliance was also placed on Sujit Tiwari v. State of Gujarat and Another, where the Supreme Court held that a person in custody for more than 2 years was entitled to bail.
 The State, on the other hand, submitted that the trial could not proceed because some co-accused persons could not be arrested till date. 
 The single bench of Justice Pankaj Jain ordered for granting of bail to the petitioner, adding that, "the petitioner had already suffered prolonged incarceration of about three years, there was no other case under the provisions of NDPS Act registered against him, and that there were 18 cited witnesses," who had to be examined.
 Case Title: Naib Singh v. State of Haryana 
 Coram: Justice Pankaj Jain

The Delhi High Court has said that sick or infirm persons need not satisfy the twin conditions for the grant of bail under Section 45(1) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The twin conditions are that when an accused applies for bail under PMLA, the public prosecutor has to be given an opportunity to oppose the same and if the court is considering grant of bail, there must be reasonable grounds for it to believe that the person is not guilty and is unlikely to commit any offence while on bail. However, a proviso to the provision states that a person who is sick or infirm may be released on bail.
After perusing the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the PMLA, Justice Jasmeet Singh in an order on a bail application said the inclusion of the proviso for grant of bail shows the legislative intent to incorporate relaxations for persons below 16 years of age; a woman or those who are sick and infirm.
The court also referred to the Supreme Court's decision in Gautam Kundu v. Directorate of Enforcement wherein it has been emphasised that the legislature has carved out the exception for these categories.
"Thus, the proviso to Section 45(1) of PMLA carves out an exception from the rigours of Section 45 for persons who are sick or infirm. Once a person falls within the proviso of Section 45(1), he need not satisfy the twin conditions under section 45(1) as elucidated in the dicta of Gautam Kundu (supra)," said Justice Singh.
The Enforcement Directorate had earlier argued that the test required is whether the applicant in custody suffers from a condition which cannot be addressed from the jail.
Justice Singh made the observations while granting bail to one Devki Nandan Garg in the money laundering case registered by the ED in connection with Shakti Bhog loan fraud case. Garg has been suffering from multiple ailments since 2001, his bail plea said.
In December 2020, CBI had registered an FIR against Shakti Bhog Foods Limited under Section 120B, 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 along with section 13(2), 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 after receiving a complaint from the State Bank of India. Since the offences were scheduled offences under PMLA, a money laundering case was registered in January 2021. 
ED's investigation revealed that Garg allegedly fabricated transport bills and used fake PAN account details in the fake invoices provided by him by Shakti Bhog Foods Limited through various shell companies. Garg is alleged to have been actively involved in rotation and layering of bank funds in dummy entities. 
According to the ED, Garg acquired 'proceeds of crime' of Rs.15.76 Crores for fake bills worth Rs.1576 Crores as commission. As per the agency, the said funds were proceeds of crime under Section 2 (u) of the PMLA. 
Senior Advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for Garg, argued that he was entitled for bail as he was covered within the definition of sick and infirm person under proviso to Section 45(1) of the PMLA. 
The court was apprised that Garg has one kidney, which is also non-functional, and the other one is impaired; has serious heart condition and had also undergone various surgeries. It was also stated that he was suffering from spondylitis, vertigo, syphilis and also contracted COVID-19 earlier this year while he was in judicial custody. 
The ED argued the medical conditions of Garg are "historical" as he has been suffering from them since 2001. 
"Even during the period of alleged offences i.e., from the year 2007 to 2012, the applicant was suffering from these ailments," the central agency counsel told the court, adding he was getting proper and satisfactory medical facilities in the jail. 
Perusing the medical reports, Justice Singh said there is no doubt that Garg is sick and infirm. The court added that some of the medical conditions are serious and life threatening. Noting that 'sick' and 'infirm' are not defined under PMLA, the court relied upon the dictionary meaning of the words.
"He is functioning on 30% capacity of one kidney and the other kidney is dead. He requires constant monitoring otherwise his fluctuations can cause death. He has undergone multiple surgeries for removal of his large intestine, gall bladder, peptic ulcer, colostomy and even a hernia operation. He has a pacemaker installed due to his heart condition and is also suffering from Spondylitis and Vertigo. During his period in jail, the applicant contracted Syphilis on 27.10.2021 and Covid-19 on 17.01.2022," said the court.
Dealing with ED's argument on whether Garg suffered from a condition which could not be addressed from the jail, the court said there cannot be a squabble with the proposition that the accused is entitled to proper and adequate medical attention and assistance. 
While prisons provide medical facilities, the services are not comparable to or equivalent to the level of treatment and care one can avail from private hospitals, said the court.
"The facilities in the jail are of a general nature and character which is inadequate to monitor proper health of the applicant who is suffering from multiple serious ailments. The jail is not equipped to provide special and intensive treatment and care that the applicant is in need of," it added. 
The court further said that Garg's condition is such that he requires emergent medical assistance which could not be provided in jail in a prompt and efficient manner vis-à-à-vis hospital atmosphere. 
"Syphilis is a bacterial infection which can remain inactive in the body for decades before becoming active again. If untreated, syphilis can severely damage the heart, brain or other organs, and can be life threatening. The risk of kidney failure is high and can be triggered by the slightest of infection. The applicant needs constant daily monitoring to check that the parameters of 30% kidney function do not collapse," the court said. 
Rejecting the argument on the ailments being "historical" in nature, the court said ailments aggravate with age. 
"I have already discussed that ailments which, coupled with old age brings the applicant within the purview of "Infirm Person". The level of care, attention, minute to minute monitoring, emergent response which the applicant can get from a hospital cannot be provided at the jail," said the court.
Title: DEVKI NANDAN GARG v. DIRECTORATE OF ENFORCEMENT

The Court found that the applicant and her sister were accused in 19 criminal cases."It is trite law that initiation of contempt proceedings is a serious step; same cannot be exercised in a routine manner. Unless there is a definite material and clear case made out, this Court would refuse to exercise contempt jurisdiction", the Gujarat High Court has held while dismissing a false application filed under Section 10 of the Contempt of Courts Act by the applicant through her sister (minor).
 The Applicant herein had approached the Court to initiate contempt proceedings against the State authorities for the wilful and deliberate disobedience of the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in DK Basu vs State of West Bengal for the alleged physical abuse endured by her sister and herself.
 It was averred that the an Activa vehicle belonging to the employee of the Applicant's sister was detained by the traffic police. On the subsequent payment of the fine, the sister reached the police station to take possession of the vehicle along with the Applicant wherein the authorities delivered blows on them resulting in serious injuries. After being admitted to the hospital, the Applicant claimed that an FIR was lodged against them along with two other Accused persons for offences under Section 447, 379 and 114 of the IPC. The Applicant insisted that no theft or trespass was committed by her.
 The State opposed the allegations relying on the CCTV camera footage which showed no signs of any abuse or atrocity being committed by the police authorities. Further, the vehicle was detained due to a violation of the provisions of the Prohibition Act. The sister of the Applicant also took possession of the vehicle unauthorizedly and therefore, an FIR for theft was lodged against her. 
The Applicant and the other Accused persons had also accompanied her to take possession of the vehicle and hence they were arraigned as accused. It also came to light that the Applicant's sister was in the habit of raising frivolous issues before officers of administration with false allegations and was an accused person in 19 offences. Per the State, due process was followed and injury was caused to the Applicant and her sister. 
 While noting these facts, Justice Shastri and Justice Kumar also noted that the injuries sustained by the Applicant and her sister were not a result of police atrocity but rather a result of a collision between two bikes. It also emerged that the sister had unauthorizedly attempted to take possession of another vehicle, as well. There were 19 criminal cases pending against her for various offences under IPC and the Prohibition Act. This led the Bench to hold:
 "On a conjoint reading of the assertion made by respondents in their reply affidavit coupled with the documents as well as stand taken by the authority, we are of the concerned opinion that it is not possible for this Court to arrive at a definite conclusion that alleged act which has been attributed against the officers can be construed as having occurred."
Refusing to exercise contempt jurisdiction "in the absence of any positive material", the Bench dismissed the Miscellaneous Civil Application.for this Court to arrive at a definite conclusion that alleged act which has been attributed against the officers can be construed as having occurred.
 Case Title: NATHIBEN LALITBHAI VEGADA Versus STATE OF GUJARAT
 Case No.: C/MCA/178/2022

The Allahabad High Court recently directed the Uttar Pradesh Government to grant a minimum pay (at par with regular employees) to 4 IVth class contractual employees who are working with U.P. State Legal Services Authority since 2005.
This order came from the bench of Justice Alok Mathur which relied upon the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of State of Punjab Vs. Jagjeet Singh (2017) 1 SCC 148 where it was observed that the employees, who are continuously discharging duties commensurate with regularly appointed persons, are also entitled to be paid the same wages in accordance with the provisions of 'equal pay for equal work'.
"...the petitioners have been working for a substantially longer length of time and are getting only Rs.7500/- per month which admittedly is below the minimum wages fixed by the State Government and accordingly, this Court is of the considered view that the petitioners are also entitled to being granted a minimum of pay scale as is being granted to regular employees as the same services are being rendered by them," the court observed in its order.
Essentially, the Court was dealing with a writ plea moved by 4 contractual employees attached to the High Court Legal Services Sub Committee, Lucknow and who were appointed to the posts of Peon and Clerk in the year 2005. They were being made a sum of Rs. 5K per month, recently, the amount was increased to Rs. 7.5K.
Earlier, the petitioners had moved to the High Court in 2015 seeking a direction to the Government to increase their pay, however, the same was disposed of by the High Court in 2018 directing the respondents to decide the representation of the petitioner.
The said representation was dismissed by the authorities and even, their case was not considered for a grant of a minimum of the pay scale, therefore, the petitioners moved to the High Court with the instant plea seeking a grant of a minimum of the pay scale.
However, relying upon the decision of the Apex Court in the case of State of Punjab v. Jagjeet Singh, and considering the fact that the petitioners have been working for a substantially longer length of time and are getting only Rs.7500/- per month, the Court directed the state government to pass fresh orders granting a minimum of the pay scale to the petitioners, within four weeks.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently ruled that only an assertion that the corpus has been abducted by some unknown miscreants, is not sufficient to seek issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.
The Bench of Justice S. A. Dharmadhikari further held that the condition precedent for instituting a writ of habeas corpus is that the person for whose release, the writ of habeas corpus is sought must be in detention and he must be under detention by the Authorities or by any private individual.
The case in brief
A Habeas corpus writ plea was instituted before the High Court by one Chhaya Gurjar submitting that certain miscreants have abducted her sister-in-law (namely Aarti), as well as, Aarti's daughter Kajal from the campus of High Court.
Further, it was contended that when mother-in-law of corpus Aarti had come to High Court in connection with some case, the accused persons abducted Aarti and her daughter Kajal. 
Lastly, it was alleged in the plea that the respondent-Authorities are having all the information in respect of both of them, but are not providing any information. It was also alleged that despite lodging a missing person report at Police Station, to date no action had been taken in that behalf.
On the other hand, the Government pleader submitted that the writ of habeas corpus can't be issued in this matter as there is no allegation that the corpus and her daughter are in illegal confinement of any private respondent. It was also submitted that the Petitioner had not impleaded any suspect as party respondent.
Court's observations 
The Court noted that the controversy in the instant matter was regarding whether a writ of habeas corpus can be issued against an unknown abductor in respect of a missing person?
At the outset, the Court said that under the writ of habeas corpus, the fundamental right and liberty is to be protected, only if there is an illegal detention, either by State or by a private individual.
Importantly, stressing that in such matters, there must be illegal detention or at least there must be some substantiated grounds regarding suspicion, the Court further remarked thus:
"In the absence of any such contention, no habeas corpus petition can be entertained under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Habeas Corpus is a writ in the nature of an order calling upon the person who has detained another to produce the latter before the Court, in order to let the Court know on what ground he has been confined and to set him free if there is no legal jurisdiction for the imprisonment."
Lastly, referring to various judgments of the Apex Court, the Court concluded thus:
"The only assertion that the corpus have been abducted by some unknown miscreants, is not sufficient to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court for issuance of writ of habeas corpus, which though a writ of right, is not a writ of course."
The petition was accordingly, dismissed, however, this Court directed the respondents/Police Authorities to bring the investigation pursuant to the missing person report to its logical end, as expeditiously as possible.
In related news, the Gauhati High Court recently held that missing person cases would not come within the ambit of a habeas corpus petition (without strong suspicion of illegal detention), but such cases are required to be registered under the regular provisions of the Indian Penal Code.

Punjab and Haryana High Court on March 11, 2022, dismissed the plea for regular bail of the petitioner who is involved in a case of honour killing of the minor daughter.
 The bench of Justice Gurvinder Singh Gill rejected the bail plea of the petitioner and directed the Trial to be expedited.
 The prosecution shall ensure the presence of the prosecution witnesses on the dates, as may be fixed by the trial Court for recording their statements so that there is no further delay in the proceedings of trial. The Trial Court may make a schedule in advance for summoning the PWs and fix short dates for the witnesses to be summoned. Special messengers be deputed for securing presence of the witnesses. If deemed necessary, a request be also be made to Senior Superintendent of Police concerned for ensuring that the presence of all the PWs is secured for the dates as may be fixed by the Trial Court."
 The case came up as a result of a conspiracy between the petitioner-mother and adoptive parents of the minor daughter who hired professional killers to get their daughter killed for 'compromising their honour' by eloping with a Balmiki boy. This is the case of double murders where in the event minor daughter along with Police personnel died.
 The undisputed facts of the case are that Sarita is the biological mother of the deceased-Juvenile Mamta who was given in adoption to her paternal uncle and aunt. Mamta eloped with a boy who belonged to a Balmiki caste. Her decision was not welcomed by the family and they saw it as an act of embarrassment and disgrace. They entered into a conspiracy to hire professional killers and kill Mamta.
 When Mamta was produced before Juvenile Justice Board, the complainants named SI Narender and Constable Sushila were accompanying her. The professional killers came on a motorcycle and fired on Mamta. As a result of which Mamta died and SI Narendra eventually succumbed to his injuries. Therefore, the present FIR was registered on the complaint of the complainant.
 Petitioner's counsel tried to carve out the possibility of motive on the part of Savita by arguing that once Savita gave away Mamta in adoption to her paternal uncle and aunt, she had nothing to do with her daughter anymore which makes Mamta's conduct not embarrassing for Savita.
 On the other hand, the State counsel while pointing strongly at the motive part submitted that since the petitioner and adoptive parents were closely related, the possibility that Mamta's conduct would affect the petitioner cannot be carved out completely. It was further submitted that the alleged act of honour killing was the result of the petitioner and other co-accused feeling that their 'honour' was compromised by Mamta having an alliance with the Balmiki boy. This fact is further concreted by the co-accused who in his disclosure statement, clearly named the petitioner as one of the co-accused.
 The court after hearing both the counsels and rejecting the contentions of the petitioners held that the facts stated above have been corroborated with various events do not leave any room for leniency. As far as the argument regarding parity with the case of other co-accused is concerned, the court stated that the petitioner cannot claim any benefit on stating that said accused were granted bail because they were not related to the deceased, unlike the petitioner being the biological mother and during the proceedings of the trial, two eye-witnesses have supported the prosecution case.
 Case Title : Savita V State Of Haryana 

The Delhi High Court has said that judges must not act in any manner which gives rise to slightest of doubt in the minds of lawyers and litigants as their conduct is noted and observed by the litigants. 
Justice Dinesh Kumar Sharma made the said observation while expressing displeasure over the conduct of a Family judge who had shared his personal mobile number with both the parties and admittedly met one of the parties in chamber, which had unnecessarily given a cause of reasonable apprehension of bias.
The Court was dealing with a plea challenging the impugned order passed by Judge, Family Court in a Guardianship Petition which had restrained the petitioner wife from removing her minor child from Delhi. The petitioner had also prayed for transfer of the proceedings and all pending applications before the Family court to any other court.
It was the case of the petitioner mother that the impugned order focused solely on the rights of the father and his family ignoring the comforts of the minor child. It was also stated that the minor child had lived alone with the mother since she was 18 months old and was heavily dependent on her and had never been separated from her. 
It was argued that separating the minor child from the mother for overnight visitation or vacation was sudden, drastic and would have a negative impact on the psyche and comfort of the minor child.
The grievances of the petitioner mother was that the Judge, Family court had shared his personal mobile number with the parties during the proceedings and the respondent father had met the judge unilaterally in his chamber. This had created an apprehension in the mind of the petitioner mother. 
The High Court thus noted that it was not advisable for the judge, Family Court to have shared his personal mobile number with the parties. 
"It is a settled proposition that justice must not only be done but must also appear to have been done. The conduct of the judge while conducting the judicial proceedings should be above board," the Court said. 
The Court was of the view that mere adverse orders are not sufficient to invoke the power of transfer and that the allegation of bias needs to be evaluated on the premises of reasonable apprehension of bias. 
The Court reiterated the proposition that mere apprehension of bias and not actual bias may be sufficient to exercise the power of transfer. 
"However, unfortunately on account of the conduct of the judge for sharing his personal mobile number with both the parties and admittedly having met one of the party in the chamber has unnecessarily given a cause of reasonable apprehension of bias. The judges have to remind themselves time and again that each and every conduct is observed and noted by the litigants and therefore, knowingly or unknowingly they may not act in any manner which gives rise to even slightest of doubt in the minds of the litigants and lawyers," the Court observed. 
The Court thus set aside the two impugned orders passed by the Family Court while directing the Principal judge, Family Court to keep the matter with himself or herself and decide the same in accordance with law without being influenced by the earlier orders passed by the Judge, Family court. 
"The principal judge, Family Court is requested to decide the said guardianship petition as expeditiously as possible preferably within four weeks. Learned Principal Judge, Family Court may also take assistance of the Child Counselor and interact with the child before deciding the visitation rights," the Court added. 
Advocates Arundhati Katju, Bhabna Das and Shristi Bor Thakur appeared for the petitioner. Senior Advocate Geeta Luthra with Advocates Asmita Narula and Apoorva Maheshwari appeared for the respondent.
CaseTitle: ADITI BAKHT v. ABHISHEK AHUJA

The Allahabad High Court has clarified that a party has the option to attract the jurisdiction of the Lucknow seat of the Allahabad High Court even if a part of the cause of action arises in the specified Oudh areas.
It is important to note that Oudh areas are those areas of the Uttar Pradesh State where the Lucknow Seat of the HC has the jurisdiction. Earlier, the Lucknow seat was known as Chief the Court in Oudh, and vide The United Provinces' High Courts (Amalgamation) Order, 1948, the Chief Court of Oudh (Presently Lucknow Seat) and Allahabad High Court were amalgamated.
Now, in the instant case, the Bench of Justice Subhash Vidyarthi held that an application under Article 226 of the Constitution of India will lie at the Lucknow seat even if the petitioners allege that only a part of the cause of action arose within the areas of Oudh. 
In other words, the court held that matters falling outside Oudh areas could very well be dealt with by the Lucknow seat of the High Court if only a part of the cause of action arises within the areas known as Oudh areas. 
Here, it is also important to note that in total 3 Mandals form part of the Oudh Areas: Lucknow Mandal, Ayodhya Mandal and Gonda Mandal. It means that all the districts falling under three mandals are part of the Oudh Areas.
These districts are: Barabanki, Faizabad/Ayodhya, Sultanpur, Hardoi, Rae Bareli, Pratapgarh, Unnao, Gonda, Bahraich, Balrampur, Shravasti, Sitapur, Ambedkar Nagar, Amethi and Lakhimpur Kheri.
The case in brief
Petitioners had taken a loan from the respondent bank at Lucknow. Thereafter, the recovery proceedings were initiated by the respondent Bank at Lucknow. The petitioners moved the Securitisation Application before the DRT at Lucknow and the DRT passed an interim order dated in April 2022 in favor of the petitioners.
Now, this very order was vacated by means of the order passed by the DRT at Lucknow in May 2022. In furtherance of the aforesaid order, the SDM concerned sent a letter on June 6, 2022 to the Inspector, Incharge of the Police Station Ghazipur, Lucknow for taking possession of the petitioners' property situated at Lucknow.
Now, the petitioners challenged the order dated before the DRAT at Allahabad and they moved the HC being aggrieved by the order of DRAT (passed on May 20, 2022) whereby the matter has been posted for JUly 28, 2022. 
It was their case that order vacating the stay was passed hastily, without application of mind and that it would result in the petitioners' property being taken away without adjudication of the respective rights of the parties.
Before the Court, a preliminary objection was raised that since the DRAT is situated in Prayagraj (outside the Oudh area) and therefore, the Lucknow seat wouldn't have the juridiction to deal with the instant plea of the petitioners and the Allahabad HC at Prayagraj shall have the jurisditction.
Court's observations 
The Court primarily relied upon the ruling of the apex court in the case of Nasiruddin vs State Transport Appellate Tribunal, 1975 (2) SCC 671, wherein it was categorically held thus:
"38… If the cause of action arises wholly within Oudh areas then the Lucknow Bench will have jurisdiction. Similarly, if the cause of action arises wholly outside the specified areas in Oudh then Allahabad will have jurisdiction. If the cause of action in part arises in the specified Oudh areas and part of the cause of action arises outside the specified areas, it will be open to the litigant to frame the case appropriately to attract the jurisdiction either at Lucknow or at Allahabad…."
The Court noted that in the instant case, though the petitioners were challenging DRAT's order passed in Prayagraj, however, the bundle of facts leading to the filing of the instant Writ Petition made it clear that a cause of action did arise within the Oudh area.
"...the petitioners' had taken a loan from the respondent no. 3 Bank situated at Lucknow, for recovery of the aforesaid amount the Additional District Magistrate (Administration), Lucknow passed an order on 28.03.2022 for taking possession of the petitioners' property situated at Lucknow, in an appeal filed by the petitioners the DRT sitting at Lucknow had passed an interim order on 28-04-2022 and the same has been vacated on 02-05-2022 at Lucknow. Therefore, it cannot be said that the cause of action for approaching this Court, or at least a part thereof, has not accrued to the petitioners at Lucknow..."
Further, the Court observed that though the order vacating stay was challenged before the DRAT Allahabad, however, the alternative remedy available before the DRAT had proved not to be an efficacious remedy as the matter had been posted for further hearing on July 27, 2022, even though the relief was required to be given immediately.
Consequently, the order of the DRT passed on May 2, 2022, was quashed and the order dated 28-04-2022 passed by the DRT in the matter was revived and the order granting interim relief was directed to remain in operation till a final order is passed after the conclusion of arguments of the parties.

The Karnataka High Court has directed the Karnataka State Mental Health Authority to take appropriate and necessary steps for providing proper medical treatment to the mentally ill inmates of rehabilitation centres, aged homes, destitute centres, reception centres, asylums, orphanages centres, etc.A division bench of Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Suraj Govindaraj... The Karnataka High Court has directed the Karnataka State Mental Health Authority to take appropriate and necessary steps for providing proper medical treatment to the mentally ill inmates of rehabilitation centres, aged homes, destitute centres, reception centres, asylums, orphanages centres, etc. A division bench of Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Suraj Govindaraj while disposing of a petition filed by the Member Secretary, High Court Legal Services Committee said, "We deem it appropriate to direct the 9th respondent - Karnataka State Mental Health Authority to take appropriate and necessary steps for providing proper medical treatment to the mentally ill inmates of the aforementioned centres within period of one month from today." The direction was given after the counsel for the legal services authority informed the court that the inmates of rehabilitation centres are not receiving proper medical treatment. Advocate B V Vidyulatha informed the court that from time to time several directions have been issued to the State authorities for improving the living conditions of the inmates and considerable improvements have been made. However, more than 30% of the inmates are mentally ill and no proper treatment is being given to them. The Court noted that the petition filed in 2010 had sought directions to the respondents to immediately extend proper treatment, medical care and aid to all the inmates, forthwith improve the living conditions, periodically inspect and report regarding the amenities provided in such institutes and monitor implementation of the welfare schemes meant for the socially deprived classes of the society. A direction was also sought to provide basic amenities and improve living conditions of inmates of all rehabilitation centres where beggars, destitutes and other under privileged classes of the society are lodged in different Institutions in the State. The court on going through the petition said, "The purpose for which the Writ Petition was filed in the year 2010 has been fulfilled. The learned counsel for the petitioner herself admits that the reason for which this petition was filed in the year 2010 no more exists. However, the mental condition of the inmates in the centres aforementioned still require medical attention and as such, directions be issued to the authorities concerned." It added that, "Considering the entire aspects of the matter and going through the records, we are of the view that we cannot keep this petition alive for an indefinite period, once the cause for which it was filed no more exists, the Writ Petition needs to be disposed of. However, while disposing of this petition, we deem it appropriate to direct the 9th respondent - Karnataka State Mental Health Authority to take appropriate and necessary steps for providing proper medical treatment to the mentally ill inmates of the aforementioned centres."

The Supreme Court has upheld the threshold limit on homebuyers - introduced by way of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code(Amendment) Act 2020 - as an attempt to "shield the corporate debtor(builder) from avoidable and frivolous applications".
A bench comprising Justices R F Nariman, Navin Sinha and KM Joseph upheld Section 3 of the IBC(Amendment) Act 2020 which introduced provisos to Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 to mandate that there should be at least one hundred real estate allottees or ten percentage of the total number of allottees, which ever is lesser, to maintain an insolvency petition in respect of a real estate project.
The judgment authored by Justice Joseph rejected the petitioners' contentions that such conditions on homebuyers amounted to hostile discrimination violating the equality principle under Article 14 of the Constitution. The Court held that a homebuyer, though treated as an unsecured creditor as per the judgment in Pioneer case, stands on a different footing from other creditors.
"When an allottee invests money in a real estate project, his primary and principal concern is that the project is completed and he gets possession of the apartment or the flat. The problem really arises as there are many stakeholders whose interests are affected", the Court observed.
On homebuyer's application can affect the entire project
The Court noted that an action under Section 7 of the Code is an action in rem. The recovery of the amounts paid is not what is primarily contemplated under the Code.The consequences of the insolvency application would be that it may land the applicant and also all the stakeholders, in liquidation of the corporate debtor. Therefore, the court said that public interest would include safeguarding the interests of all the stakeholders. 
"This may necessarily include the corporate debtor as a stakeholder, being protected from applications, which are perceived as frivolous or not representing a critical mass", the Court observed.
The Court also noted that the homebuyer has remedies under the RERA Act and the Consumer Protection Act against the builder for non-delivery of the apartment.
Supreme Court Upholds Sections 3, 4 & 10 Of IBC Amendment Act 2020
The Court also said that the amendment has sought to strike a balance between completely taking away an allottees right to initiate insolvency and "giving an unbridled license to a single person to hold the real estate project and all the stakeholders thereunder hostage".
"If the Legislature felt that having regard to the consequences of an application under the Code, when such a large group of persons, pull at each other, an additional threshold be erected for exercising the right under Section 7, certainly, it cannot suffer a constitutional veto at the hands of Court exercising judicial review of legislation", the judgment stated.
"It is to be noted also that it is not a case where the right of the allottee is completely taken away. All that has happened is a half-way house is built between extreme positions, viz., denying the right altogether to the allottee to move the application under Section  of the Code and giving an unbridled license to a single person to hold the real estate project and all the stakeholders thereunder hostage to a proceeding under the Code which must certainly pass inexorably within a stipulated period of time should circumstances exists under Section 33 into corporate death with the unavoidable consequence of all allottees and not merely the applicant under Section 7 being visited with payment out of the liquidation value, the amounts which are only due to the unsecured creditor".
The apex court observed that the legislature in its wisdom has felt that "greater good lies in conditioning an absolute right which existed in favour of an allottee by requirements which would ensure some certain element of consensus among the allottees".
"It must be remembered that the requirement is a mere one-tenth of the allottees. This is a number which goes to policy and lies exclusively within the wisdom of the Legislature. Hence, we have no hesitation in repelling the contentions in this regard".
Imposing threshold will halt indiscriminate litigation
The SC observed :
"Insisting on a threshold in regard to these categories of creditors would lead to the halt to indiscriminate litigation which would result in an uncontrollable docket explosion as far as the authorities which work the Code are concerned. The debtor who is apparently stressed is relieved of the last straw on the camel's back, as it were, by halting individual creditors whose views are not shared even by a reasonable number of its peers rushing in with applications. Again, as in the case of the allottees, this is not a situation where while treating them as financial creditors they are totally deprived of the right to apply under Section 7 as part of the legislative scheme. The legislative policy reflects an attempt at shielding the corporate debtor from what it considers would be either for frivolous or avoidable applications.
What we mean by avoidable applications is a decision which would not be taken by similarly placed creditors keeping in mind the consequences that would ensue not only in regard to persons falling in the same category but also the generality of creditors and other stakeholders. All that the amendment is likely to ensure is that the filing of the application is preceded by a consensus at least by a minuscule percentage of similarly placed creditors that the time has come for undertaking a legal odyssey which is beset with perils for the applicants themselves apart from others. As far as the percentage of applicants contemplated under the proviso it is clear that it cannot be dubbed as an arbitrary or capricious figure. The legislature is not wanting in similar requirements under other laws. The provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and its predecessors contained similar provisions. Allowing what is described as 'lone Ranger' applications beset with extremely serious ramifications which are at cross purposes with the objects of the code. This is apart from it in particular spelling avoidable doom for the interest of the creditors falling in the same categories. The object of speed in deciding CIRP proceedings would also be achieved by applying the threshold to debenture holders and security holders. The dividing line between wisdom or policy of the legislature and limitation placed by the Constitution must not be overlooked"(paragraph 220)
'Malice' Is Not A Ground To Challenge A Law Made By Legislature : Supreme Court
While agreeing that the homebuyers had a "vested right" to move the application without conditions before the amendment, the Court said that such a "vested right" can also be taken away by the legislature.
"We cannot also lose sight of the fact that the Legislature has power to impair and take away vested rights", the SC observed.

A public interest litigation has been filed in the Supreme Court, underscoring the issue of long pendency of cases in Subordinates Courts in India, inter alia seeking formal guidelines and rule of procedures for the appointment of judges within the time-bound duration.
 The petition has been filed by a final year law student, Shrikant Prasad, stating that the delay in the administration of justice causes mental harassment to both victims and accused, and amounts to denial of Right to Life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. [Hussainara Khatoon (IV) v Home Secretary, State of Bihar [(1980) 1 SCC 98]
 The Petitioner pointed out that about 3.5 crore cases are pending in Indian District Courts, out of which about 2.5 crore cases are of criminal nature. Moreover, about 56,000 cases pending since more than 30years.
 "The issue of judicial backlog and delay is widely acknowledged and extensively written about, but it seems to be nowhere close to being resolved. Today, a litigant can be stuck in court corridors for decades…the original litigant may not even be alive by the time the court resolves the issue. It is a stretch to describe any verdict given after decades as 'justice'," states the plea.
 The petition identifies that the primary reason behind such delay in justice is lack of Judges & corresponding Staff in subordinate Courts. Relying on a 2019 report published by the Union Law Ministry, the Petitioner submitted that there are merely 20 judges per 10 lakh people in the country, as compared to 17 in 2014.
 This results in listing of too many cases before a Judge on each day, and it becomes impossible to meaningfully hear so many cases, thus inevitably leading to multiple adjournments, the plea avers.
 Further, as per a report published by the Supreme Court, the subordinate judiciary requires more than 5,000 courtrooms to accommodate more than 20,000 judicial officers. There is also a need to fill more than 40,000 staff positions, which have been lying vacant for many years.
 In this backdrop, the Petitioner has urged the Court to direct the concerned authorities to fill the vacant posts of subordinate courts and also increase the number of Judges in proportion laid down in All India Judges Association & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., 2002 SC 247. 
 In this case, the Top Court had directed the Central Government as well as the State Governments to increase the number of judges in Trial Courts, to curb the delays.
 Further, the Petitioner has suggested that the Supreme Court and the High Court may, in exercise of their powers under Article 127 of the Constitution, appoint effective and efficient Judges as AD-HOC Judges.
 A further direction is sought to make sure that infrastructures of Subordinate Courts is maintained properly.

The Tripura High Court has observed that people who have received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, including both Covishield or Covaxin, cannot be made to wait indefinitely for receiving their second dose after the mandatory interval is over. It therefore asked the State administration to raise the number of vaccination doses.
The observation came from a division bench comprising of Chief Justice Akil Kureshi and Justice S Talapatra. It stated,
"…what causes concern is that those who have already received first vaccine, would qualify for administration of second doze upon completion of 12 weeks or 4 weeks depending on the vaccine administered (Covishield or Covaxin as the case may be). These people, who have already received their first doze, cannot wait indefinitely for receiving the second doze after the mandatory period is over." 
Furthermore, it said: 
"In our State, surely there are large number of people (about 14 lakhs going by the figures of the vaccine bulletin) who have received the first vaccine but not the second vaccine. The State administration must think about raising sufficient number of vaccine dozes to cover this population within the recommended period." 
The Court also asked the State Government to take up the aforesaid issue with the committee looking into the aspect of allocation of vaccines. 
Relying on two newspapers articles published on June 25, quoting the National Health Mission Director of the State that around 80% of population in all groups and 98% from the age group of 45 have received their first doses, the Court observed that neither of the claims were accurate. 
Stressing on the need for transparency and accuracy in public information distribution by the State, the Court said:
"When an officer as responsible as the Mission Direction of National Health Mission, Tripura, is quoted to have provided information which was inaccurate, we expected him to issue correction statement to the press." 
"At least, an official statement to the press pointing out that either there was an error on his side in providing the information or there was a misunderstanding on part of the press should have been issued. We expect him to do so without any further delay." The Court directed. 
Furthermore, the Court noted that drop in the positivity rate has plateaued out and the same is lingering around 5% since some time. It thus asked the State Government to implement Covid-19 safety guidelines and also the people to scrupulously follow them. "These figures plainly suggest that there is no place for complacency in dealing with the Covid situation," the Court said.

The Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Wednesday said that a mere right to change ruler once every few years need not be a guarantee against tyranny."The idea that people are the ultimate sovereign is also to be found in notions of human dignity and autonomy.

The Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Wednesday said that a mere right to change ruler once every few years need not be a guarantee against tyranny.
"The idea that people are the ultimate sovereign is also to be found in notions of human dignity and autonomy. A public discourse, that is both reasoned and reasonable, is to be seen as an inherent aspect of human dignity and hence essential to a properly functioning democracy", the Chief Justice of India said.
Referring to the fact that in 17 general elections held so far in India, people have changed the ruling government 8 times, which is nearly 50% of the elections, the CJI said that this was an indication that the people of India are "intelligent and up to the task" despite large scale inequalities, poverty and backwardness.
"The masses have performed their duties reasonably well. Now, it is the turn of those who are manning the key organs of the State to ponder if they are living upto the Constitutional mandate", he added.
He was delivering an online lecture as part of 17the Justice PD Desai Memorial Lecture. The topic of the lecture was "rule of law".
Judiciary cannot be controlled directly or indirectly by legislature or executive
The CJI underscored that for judiciary to apply checks on governmental power and action, it has to have complete freedom.
"Judiciary cannot be controlled, directly or indirectly, by legislature or executive, or else rule of law would become illusory", CJI Ramana said. The Chief Justice also cautioned that judges should not get swayed by the "emotional pitch of public opinion, which is often amplified by social media platforms".
"Judges have to be mindful of the fact that the noise thus amplified is not necessarily reflective of what is right and what majority believes in. The new media tools that have enormous amplifying ability are incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, good and bad and the real and fake. Therefore, media trials cannot be a guiding factor in deciding cases. It is therefore extremely vital to function independently and withstand all external aids and pressures. While there is a lot discussion about the pressure from the executive, it is also imperative to start a discourse as to how social media trends can affect the institutions", he said.
 When law was used a toll of political repression
In his lecture, the CJI referred to the colonial regime when "law was used as a tool of political repression".
"The British used the law as a tool of political repression, enforcing it unequally on the parties, with a different set of rules for the British and for the Indians.It was an enterprise famous for "Rule by Law", rather than "Rule of Law" as it aimed at controlling the Indian subjects. Judicial remedies lost their significance,as they were administered keeping in view the best interests of the colonial power, rather than what was just or legal", he said.
The concept of "Rule of Law" changed with a growing consciousness about the values of liberty, equality, fraternity and justice after the adoption of the Indian Constitution. 
"The move from a colonial past to the present required a shift from the colonial idea of laws imposed by foreign rulers for their benefit, to laws given by our people to govern themselves, laws which are not merely commands but are also embodied by a sense of justice", he said.
The CJI said said it was time to pause and ask to what extent the Rule of Law was used to protect ordinary lives during the pandemic.
"I do not intend to provide an evaluation of the same. Both my office and my temperament prevent me from doing so. But I began to feel that this pandemic might yet be a mere curtain raiser to much larger crises in the decades to come. Surely, we must at least begin the process of analysing what we did right and where we went wrong," the CJI said.

The Kerala High Court recently observed that constant and repeated taunts of the husband that his wife did not meet his expectations and comparisons with other women would amount to mental cruelty as contemplated under Section 10(x) of the Divorce Act, 1869 for the purpose of dissolution of marriage.
A Division Bench of Justice Anil K Narendran and Justice C. S. Sudha observed that for the conduct of a spouse to fall within the ground of cruelty, it should be 'grave and weighty' to the extent that the petitioner's spouse cannot be reasonably expected to live with the other spouse, and should be serious that "ordinary wear and tear of married life".
"The constant and repeated taunts of the respondent/husband that the petitioner is not a wife of his expectations; the comparisons with other women etc. would certainly be mental cruelty which a wife cannot be expected to put up with."
The marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was solemnized in January 2019 and the petition for dissolution of marriage was filed within 10 months from the marriage. A decree of dissolution of marriage was granted by the lower court under section 10(vii) of the Indian Divorce Act i.e., non-consummation of marriage.
Aggrieved by this decree, an appeal was filed by the husband alleging that the court below had erroneously concluded that the marriage has not been consummated and so granted the petitioner-wife a decree of dissolution under Section 10(vii) of the Act.
Counsel appearing for the respondent-husband, Advocates Thushara James and Amal Darshan, contended that the point framed itself is incorrect, because, unless the petitioner pleads and proves willful abstinence/refusal by the respondent to consummate the marriage, she cannot succeed. However, the court below never went into the said aspect. Further, it was submitted that in the petition originally filed, the petitioner never had a case of non-consummation of marriage. It was also pointed out that there are no sufficient pleadings to establish the grounds under section 10(vii) of the Act. 
However, it was submitted by the counsel appearing for the petitioner, Advocates K.P. Sreeja and M. B. Sandeep, that the omission of the incorporation of the ground under Section 10(vii) in the petition initially filed was an inadvertent mistake on the part of the counsel. Further, the counsel contended that necessary pleadings have been brought in by way of the amendment carried out, which amended pleadings contain the necessary ingredients to make out a case under Section 10(vii) of the Act. 
The petitioner had also challenged the findings of the lower court rejecting the ground of cruelty raised under Section 10(x) of the Act. The petitioner contended that under Order XLI Rule 24 and Rule 33 give ample power to this Court to "resettle the issues and determine the case for meeting the ends of justice" and the Court sided with the contention raised by the petitioner.
In the petition, the petitioner had referred to instances of physical cruelty as well as mental cruelty. It was alleged that the respondent, a man of short temper, was a person who gets easily provoked. He used to pick quarrels with the petitioner even on trivial matters. When he loses his temper, he turns violent and physically assaults his family members. Yet another allegation against the respondent was that he was always in the habit of belittling and humiliating the petitioner by comparing her with other women.
The Court while answering the question as to whether the conduct of the respondent amounts to cruelty, referred to a number of Apex Court decisions and observed that it is difficult to give a comprehensive definition of cruelty, as it changes according to the changes and advancement of social concepts and standards of living. 
"Continuous ill-treatment, cessation of marital intercourse, studied neglect, indifference on the part of the husband, and an assertion on the part of the husband that the wife is unchaste, are all factors which lead to mental or legal cruelty." 
Reliance was placed on Shoba Rani v. Madhukar Reddi, in which the concept of cruelty was examined in the context of the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, the Court observed that cruelty may be mental or physical, intentional or unintentional. If it is physical, it is a question of fact and degree. If it is mental, the enquiry must begin as to the nature of the cruel treatment and then as to the impact of such treatment on the mind of the spouse. Whether it caused reasonable apprehension that it would be harmful or injurious to live with the other, ultimately, is a matter of inference to be drawn by taking into account the nature of the conduct and its effect on the complaining spouse. 
It has been further held that the cruelty alleged may largely depend upon the type of life, the parties are accustomed to or their economic and social conditions and their culture and human values to which they attach importance. The Court, therefore, observed that since each case has to be decided on its own merits, it would be better to place less reliance upon precedents.
 A set of facts stigmatized as cruelty in one case may not be so in another case. The cruelty alleged may largely depend upon the type of life the parties are accustomed to or their economic and social conditions. It may also depend upon their culture and human values to which they attach importance. Judges and lawyers, therefore, should not import their own notions of life. It would also be better there  is less reliance upon precedents.
 The Court further observed that to constitute cruelty, the conduct complained of should be "grave and weighty" so as to come to the conclusion that the petitioner's spouse cannot be reasonably expected to live with the other spouse. It must be something more serious than "ordinary wear and tear of married life". 
The conduct, taking into consideration the circumstances and background has to be examined to reach the conclusion whether the conduct complained of amounts to cruelty in the matrimonial law, opined the Court. 
Furthermore, it was observed by the Court that physical violence is not absolutely essential to constitute cruelty and a consistent course of conduct inflicting immeasurable mental agony and torture may well constitute cruelty within the meaning of Section 10 of the Act. 
"Mental cruelty may consist of verbal abuses and insults by using filthy and abusive language leading to constant disturbance of mental peace of the other party and in the present case from the pleadings and testimonies adduced before the Court, the Court observed that the petitioner cannot be expected to put up with the demeaning attitude and behaviour of the respondent towards her."
However, the Bench added that there may be cases where the conduct complained of itself is bad enough and per se unlawful or illegal. Ins uch cases, the impact or the injurious effect on the other spouse does not have to be enquired into or considered; cruelty will be established if the conduct itself is proved or admitted. 
"The absence of intention should not make any difference in the case, if by ordinary sense in human affairs, the act complained of could otherwise be regarded as cruelty. Intention is not a necessary element in cruelty. The relief to the party cannot be denied on the ground that there has been no deliberate or wilful ill-treatment."
Since the matrimonial bond between the parties seemed beyond repair and the marriage between the parties was only in name and the marriage has been wrecked beyond the hope of salvage, public interest and interest of all concerned lies in the recognition of the fact, the Court opined that to keep the sham is obviously conducive to immorality and potentially more prejudicial to the public interest than a dissolution of the marriage bond.
Thereby, the Court dismissed the appeal but modified the decree granted by the Lower Court for dissolution of marriage as one under Section 10(x) of the Act.

The Supreme Court has held that Consumer Courts can grant relief to flatbuyers who are aggrieved with the delay in delivery of the apartment as per the agreement.
Consumer Courts have the power to direct refund and compensation to a consumer for the deficiency in not delivering the apartment as per the terms of Agreement, the Court held.
"A consumer invoking the jurisdiction of the Commission can seek such reliefs as he/she considers appropriate. A consumer can pray for refund of the money with interest and compensation. The consumer could also ask for possession of the apartment with compensation.", the bench comprising Justices UU Lalit, S. Ravindra Bhat and PS Narasimha observed.
In this case, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission directed a Developer to refund an amount of Rs. 2,06,41,379 with interest @ 9% p.a. to the Consumer for its failure to deliver possession of the apartment within the time stipulated as per the Apartment Buyers Agreement. The issue raised in the appeal by the builder are the following:
I. Whether the terms of the Apartment Buyers Agreement amount to an 'unfair trade practice' and whether the Commission is justified in not giving effect to the terms of Apartment Buyer's Agreement as laid down in the Pioneer case? 
II. Whether the Commission has the power under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 to direct refund of the amount deposited by the Consumer with interest?
Regarding the first issue, the bench upheld the Commission's finding that the clauses of the agreement are one-sided and that the Consumer is not bound to accept the possession of the apartment and can seek refund of the amount deposited by her with interest.
On the second issue, the bench first considered the submission of the appellant that the Consumer, having elected to proceed under the Act, the provisions of the RERA Act will have no application. Referring to Imperia Structures Ltd v. Anil Patni (2020) 10 SCC 783 and IREO Grace Realtech (P) Ltd. V. Abhishek Khanna (2021) 3 SCC 241, the bench observed that Consumer Protection Act and the RERA Act neither exclude nor contradict each other. In this regard, the court observed:
"When Statutes provisioning judicial remedies fall for construction, the choice of the interpretative outcomes should also depend on the constitutional duty to create effective judicial remedies in furtherance of access to justice. A meaningful interpretation that effectuates access to justice is a constitutional imperative and it is this duty that must inform the interpretative criterion.. When Statutes provide more than one judicial fora for effectuating a right or to enforce a duty-obligation, it is a feature of remedial choices offered by the State for an effective access to justice. Therefore, while interpreting statutes provisioning plurality of remedies, it is necessary for Courts to harmonise the  provisions in a constructive manner."
Referring to Section 14 of Consumer Protection act, the bench , while dismissing the appeal filed by the developer, observed:
15. We may hasten to clarify that the power to direct refund of the amount and to compensate a consumer for the deficiency in not delivering the apartment as per the terms of Agreement is within the jurisdiction of the Consumer Courts. Under Section 14 of the Consumer Protection Act, if the Commission is satisfied …that any of the allegations contained in the complaint about the services are proved, it shall issue an order to the opposite party directing him to, return to the complainant the price or as the case may be, the charges paid by the complainant. 'Deficiency' is defined under Section 2(g) to include any shortcoming or inadequacy in performance which has been undertaken by a person in pursuance of a contract or otherwise relating to any service. These two provisions are reproduced hereinbelow for ready reference.13 It is clear from the statutory position that the Commission is empowered to direct refund of the price or the charges paid by the consumer
A consumer invoking the jurisdiction of the Commission can seek such reliefs as he/she considers appropriate. A consumer can pray for refund of the money with interest and compensation. The consumer could also ask for possession of the apartment with compensation. The consumer can also make a prayer for both in the alternative. If a consumer prays for refund of the amount, without an alternative prayer, the Commission will recognize such a right and grant it, of course subject to the merits of the case. If a consumer seeks alternative reliefs, the Commission will consider the matter in the facts and circumstances of the case and will pass appropriate orders as justice demands. This position is similar to the mandate under Section 18 of the RERA Act.

The Supreme Court observed that quantity of narcotic substance recovered is a relevant factor that can be taken into account for imposing higher than the minimum punishment under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.
The bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah observed that the Court has a wide discretion to impose the sentence/imprisonment ranging between 10 years to 20 years and while imposing such sentence/imprisonment in addition, the Court may also take into consideration factor as it may deem fit other than the factors enumerated in Section 32B (a) to (f) of the Act.
In this case, the accused was found to be in possession of 1 kg heroin which is four times more than the minimum of commercial quantity. The minimum sentence for commercial quantity shall not be less than 10 years, which may extend to 20 years with fine which shall not be less than Rs.1 lakh but which may extend to Rs.2 lakhs. The Special Court convicted the accused for the offence punishable under Section 21 of the Act and sentenced him to undergo 15 years R.I. and to pay a fine of Rs.2 Lakhs and in default of payment of fine, to further undergo one year R.I. As the High Court dismissed his appeal, the accused approached the Apex court.
The appellant's contention was that while imposing a punishment of 15 years R.I. which is  higher than the minimum term of imprisonment of 10 years R.I., neither the Special Court nor the High Court have assigned any reasons taking into account the factors mentioned in Section 32B of the Act. 
To answer this contention, the bench referred to Section 32B of the Act provides for factors to be taken into account for imposing higher than the minimum punishment. The court noted that the Section 32B of the Act itself further provides that the Court may, in addition to such factors as it may deem fit, take into account the factors for imposing a punishment higher than the minimum term of imprisonment or amount of fine as mentioned in Section 32B of the Act. Referring to the judgment in Rafiq Qureshi vs. Narcotic Control Bureau, Eastern Zonal Unit, (2019) 6 SCC 492 , the bench observed.
"Therefore, while imposing the punishment higher than the minimum term of imprisonment or amount of fine, the Court may take into account such factors as it may deem fit and also the factors enumerated/mentioned in Section 32B of the Act. Therefore, on fair reading of Section 32B of the Act, it cannot be said that while imposing a punishment higher than the minimum term of imprisonment or amount of fine, the Court has to consider only those factors which are mentioned/enumerated in Section 32B of the Act..."
"Therefore, quantity of substance would fall into "such factors as it may deem fit" and while exercising its discretion of imposing the sentence/imprisonment higher than the minimum, if the Court has taken into consideration such factor of larger/higher quantity of substance, it cannot be said that the Court has committed an error. The Court has a wide discretion to impose the sentence/imprisonment ranging between 10 years to 20 years and while imposing such sentence/imprisonment in addition, the Court may also take into consideration other factors as enumerated in Section 32B (a) to (f). Therefore, while imposing a punishment higher than the minimum sentence, if the Court has considered such factor as it may deem fit other than the factors  enumerated in Section 32B (a) to (f), the High Court has to only consider whether "such factor" is a relevant factor or not"
In the present case, the court noted that, the accused was found to be in possession of 4 times higher than the minimum commercial quantity. "Therefore, the sentence imposed by the Special Court imposing the sentence of 15 years R.I. with fine of Rs.2 lakhs, confirmed by the High Court is not required to be interfered with by this Court. It cannot be said that while imposing such punishment the Court has taken into consideration any irrelevant factors", the bench said.
The bench also considered the the submission on behalf of the accused on mitigating and aggravating circumstances and the request to take lenient view and not to impose the punishment higher than the minimum sentence provided under the Act. While dismissing appeal, the bench observed: 
It should be borne in mind that in a murder case, the accused commits murder of one or two persons, while those persons who are dealing in narcotic drugs are instruments in causing death or in inflicting death blow to number of innocent young victims who are vulnerable; it cause deleterious effects and deadly impact on the society; they are hazard to the society. Organized activities of the underworld and the clandestine smuggling of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances into this country and illegal trafficking in such drugs and substances shall lay to drug addiction among a sizeable section of the public, particularly the adolescents and students of both sexes and the menace has assumed serious and alarming proportions in the recent years. Therefore, it has a deadly impact on the society as a whole. Therefore, while awarding the sentence/punishment in case of NDPS Act, the interest of the society as a whole is also required to be taken in consideration. Therefore, while striking balance between the mitigating and aggravating circumstances, public interest, impact on the society as a whole will always be tilt in favour of the suitable higher punishment. Therefore, merely because the accused is a poor man and/or a carrier and/or is a sole bread earner cannot be such mitigating circumstances in favour of the accused while awarding the sentence/punishment in the case of NDPS Act. Even otherwise, in the present case, the Special Court, as observed hereinabove has taken into consideration the submission on behalf of the accused that he is a poor person; that he is sole bread earner, that it  is his first offence, while not imposing the maximum punishment of 20 years R.I and imposing the punishment of 15 years R.I. only.

Expressing its shock over the incident wherein a girl, who was allegedly sexually assaulted and ravaged was left on a railway platform, the Bombay High Court directed the Investigating officer to take corrective measures and trace the victim girl.
 Reminding the state of its duty to take preventive measures to stop youth exploitation, the Bench of Justice Bharati Dangre remarked,
 "There are legislations, which mandate the State in consonance with the imperative mandate contained in the Directive Principles of State Policy, to ensure that the youth is not exploited."
 Facts in brief
 The Court was hearing the Bail Application, where the Applicant was arraigned as an accused under Sections 354, 363, and 376 of the IPC and Sections 8 and 12 of POCSO Act.
 The FIR was lodged by a passer-by who, in June 2018 noticed an auto-rickshaw with black curtains on all sides and could overhear cry of a girl. 
 When inquired, the auto-rickshaw driver responded by saying that his vehicle was having passengers, however, as the cries of the girl still continued.
 As alleged by the complainant, he pulled out the curtain of the auto-rickshaw and noticed that one man was forcing himself upon a girl, noticing this, he asked the person to come out of the auto-rickshaw and when he refused, he pulled him out. 
 At that time, the traffic police reached there and the said person was apprehended and the person, who was allegedly apprehended, is the instant Bail Applicant.
 Girl's statement
 The statement of the victim girl was recorded, wherein she submitted that she was 16 years, however, the court noted that not a single document was filed to establish that the girl is of 16 years, and the Investigating Officer did not conduct any ossification test.
 She referred to the entire incident in great detail and stated that she knew the auto-rickshaw driver for 5 to 6 months and another person, to whom she referred to as the person who committed the sexual assault on her, was alleged to be the brother of the auto-rickshaw driver. 
 She admitted that she was given beer to drink and some food was also served and she relished the food and drink and was in a drunken state.
On the other hand, the Applicant submitted that the Girl was into flesh trade and whatever had happened it was with her consent.
 Court's observations
 The Court, at the outset, observed,
 "Some strange things have surfaced, which surely calls for introspection of all the stakeholders dealing with issues of women, particularly minor girls."
 When A.P.P. was asked about the victim and her present status, it was submitted that she continued to dwell on Platform No.1 of Andheri Railway Station.
 Importantly, the Court remarked,
 "It is surprising, rather shocking to note that a girl, who had met with a sexual assault and ravage is left on a railway platform in such a manner."
 The Court also observed that the Investigating Officer wasn't aware of any of the provisions of the law, which would have ensured the girl to be taken to some rehabilitation home or correction home.
 The Court also observed that when it is the case of the prosecution that the girl is a minor, the assistance of the Juvenile Justice Board should have been taken, but nothing had been done.
 Further, the Court directed the IO,
 "At least now, some corrective steps be taken to trace the victim girl and take necessary steps as regards the said girl."
 The Court also directed that she be subjected to the Ossification Test if no document is available with her as proof of her age. 
 Importantly, regarding the Bail application, the Court said that in any case, till the said picture becomes clear, the Applicant must wait.

The Kerala High Court has held that if a party enters into a second marriage when the appeal of the decree of divorce of the first marriage is still pending, he/she will not be guilty of the offence of bigamy under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code if the appeal is subsequently dismissed. While allowing a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash...
The Kerala High Court has held that if a party enters into a second marriage when the appeal of the decree of divorce of the first marriage is still pending, he/she will not be guilty of the offence of bigamy under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code if the appeal is subsequently dismissed. 
While allowing a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the complaint alleging bigamy, the Court ruled that Section 15  of the Hindu Marriage Act does not override Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, which confers a right of appeal. 
 Justice P. Somarajan while allowing the Criminal Miscellaneous Petition, observed: 
"Once the appeal ends in dismissal confirming the decree of divorce of the Family Court, it would come under the third limb of Section 15 of the Act irrespective of the fact that the marriage was solemnized either before the presentation of appeal or before the culmination of appeal." 
This observation came in a matter where a woman had alleged that her husband entered into a second marriage during the pendency of the appeal against the decree of divorce. 
The man was accordingly booked for offences under Sections 494, 114 r/w Section 34 IPC. Aggrieved by this, the man approached the Court. 
The petitioner's second marriage was solemnized after the decree of divorce by the Family Court but during the pendency of an appeal and a stay order. 
The question before the Court was whether the offence under Sections 494 and 114 IPC would stand attracted when a second marriage was solemnized after the decree of divorce of the first marriage but before the culmination of its appeal.
Upon exploring the offence of bigamy, the Court laid down the statutory pre-requisites essential to constitute the offence:
(i) the accused must have contracted first marriage 
(ii) he must have married again 
(iii) the first marriage must be subsisting
(iv) the spouse must be living 
Additionally, as per the dictum laid down in Gopal Lal v. State of Rajasthan [AIR 1979 (SC)713], the second marriage should be void by reason of its taking place during the lifetime of the first husband or wife.
The Court also noted that amended Section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act deals with the stage in which a divorced person can validly enter into a second marriage.
 It says that after the decree of dissolving the marriage, either there is no right of appeal or if there is such a right, the time for appealing has expired without an appeal having been presented or an appeal has been presented, but has been dismissed, it shall be lawful either of the party to the marriage to marry again.
In the instant case, although the husband had entered into a second marriage during the stay order, the appeal ended in dismissal subsequently confirming the decree of divorce. 
The Court ruled that under such circumstances, the doctrine of merger would come into play and the decree of the Family Court will stand merged in the appellate decree. Therefore, the decree would operate not from the date of the first appellate decree, but from the date of the decree of divorce granted by the Family Court.
"The decree of divorce confirmed in appeal would stand effective from the date of the original decree of divorce of the Family Court and the appellate decree will revert back to the date of the decree of divorce of the Family Court."
The Court referred to the decision of the Apex Court in Lila Gupta v. Laxmi Narain and Others (AIR 1978 SC 1351) to substantiate its position. 
It was also noted that once the appeal ends in dismissal confirming the decree of divorce of the Family Court, it would come under the third limb of Section 15 of the Act irrespective of the fact that the marriage was solemnized either before the presentation of appeal or before the culmination of appeal. 
Hence, in such matters, the offence under Section 494 IPC will not stand attracted. 
"On account of the confirmation of decree of divorce in appeal, the first marriage will stand dissolved from the date of decree of Family Court and thereafter it cannot be said that there exists a subsisting marriage relationship or a living spouse for the purpose of Section 494 IPC." 
Allowing the petition, the Court held that the perfunctory offence alleged under Section 114 IPC will not stand attracted when the main substratum under Section 494 IPC becomes inoperative and non-est.
Hence, the cognizance taken for the offence under Section 494, 114 r/w Section 34 IPC will not stand in the eye of law and the same was quashed. 
Advocates P.K Priya and Moncy Francis represented the petitioner. Advocates M.S Letha, Rajit and Government Pleader Noushad K.A appeared for the respondents.  
Case Title: Manoj v. State of Kerala & Ors. 

The Jammu and Kashmir & Ladakh High Court has said that unlike in the cases of malicious prosecution relating to criminal proceedings no action can be brought as a general rule in the cases of civil proceedings even though the same are malicious and have been brought without any reasonable cause.
"It is only in exceptional circumstances that a suit for damages on account of malicious prosecution in civil proceedings can be maintained,"Justice Sanjay Dhar added.
The Single bench was dealing with an appeal seeking compensation for malicious prosecution.
The bench noted that the very first suit for recovery was filed by the Appellant herein and that the defendant did not initiate the prosecution. The defendant had only preferred appeals and revision petitions against the award granted in favour of the Appellant herein in the recovery suit.
In this backdrop the High Court said that in order to succeed in a case for recovery of damages for malicious prosecution, it has to be first shown that it is the defendant who has initiated the prosecution. In the instant case, admittedly, the litigation was initiated by the plaintiff and not by the defendant. 
The Bench further held that the Appellant failed to show that the litigation was resorted to by the defendant without any reasonable cause. "In the instant case, once an award was passed against the defendant, he had no choice but to challenge the same by way of appropriate proceedings. Therefore, it cannot be stated even on the basis of the admitted facts that the defendant had filed these proceedings without any reasonable cause."
Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.
 Case Title : Jagdish Giri Vs Talib Hussain.
 Coram: Justice Sanjay Dhar
 Counsel For Petitioner : Mr Prince Hamza
 Counsel For Respondent : Mr TH Khawaja

The Delhi High Court recently passed a summary judgment in favour of the Dream11 parent company Sporta Technologies Private Limited against a person who was operating the domain name 'www.dream11.bet' allegedly as a gambling website.
Justice Navin Chawla said the plaintiffs have been able to prove that they are the registered proprietor of the 'Dream11 Marks' and that the domain name adopted by the defendant is deceptively similar to that of the plaintiffs and is clearly intended to ride on the goodwill and reputation of their marks.
"The adoption of the domain name www.dream11.bet is a clear case of infringement of the marks of the plaintiffs and amounts to passing off the services of the defendant as that of the plaintiffs. The defendant not only intends to take unfair advantage of the marks of the plaintiffs and ride on the reputation of the plaintiffs' marks, but also deceive unwary consumer of their association with the plaintiffs. Such acts of the defendant would also lead to dilution of the mark of the plaintiffs," said the court.
Suit
Sporta Technologies in the suit filed in 2020 had sought a permanent injunction against the defendant from using 'Dream11' in the domain name or in any other manner which amounts to the infringement or passing of the plaintiff's trade marks. 
The company runs Dream11, which is an online multi-player game where the participants draft virtual teams of real players of a professional sport and get points based on the performance of the players in actual games. The top teams of each contest are rewarded monetarily from a Prize Pool, where the amount won can be withdrawn by a participant from their verified Bank Account, according to the suit.
The court was told that in December 2019, they learnt about the domain name 'www.dream11.bet,' which was being operated by the defendant including as a YouTube Channel, containing match-prediction videos, touting their website to be a gambling website, offering contact details to enable users to obtain login credentials to place bets, using which credentials and upon payment of a sum of money, one could access the defendant's betting website. The website contained plaintiffs' 'Dream11' Trademarks.
 Interim Relief
 The high court on February 6 in 2020 had directed the domain name registrar GoDaddy to immediately disable and suspend the website 'www.dream11.bet.' A direction was also issued to YouTube to "suspend/remove/take down" the channel 'Dream11.bet' from its platform. 
 Since the defendant failed to file its written statement, its right to file the same was closed by the Joint Registrar (Judicial) in July 2022. The defendant was proceeded against ex-parte.
 Contentions of the plaintiffs
 The plaintiffs argued that the adoption of the 'Dream11 Marks' by the defendant as a part of their trade name and domain name was mala fide and was intended to trade upon the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiffs, amounting to infringement and passing off. 
 They argued that the adoption of their trademarks by the defendant for the activities of betting and gambling was illegal under the Public Gambling Act, 1867. It was further submitted various High Courts — Varun Gumber v. Union Territory of Chandigarh, 2017 SCC OnLine P&H 5372 and Gurdeep Singh Sachar v. Union of India and Others, 2019 SCC OnLine Bom 13059, have held that the business being carried out by Dream11 has an element of skill, and thus the platform is not illegal.
Ruling 
 The high court said that in Anugya Gupta v. Ajay Kumar and Another, 2022 SCC OnLine Del 1922, it has been held that the right of a proprietor in a domain name is entitled to equal protection, applying the principles of the trade mark law. 
"The use of the same or similar domain name may lead to diversion of users, which could result from such users mistakenly accessing one domain name instead of another. Therefore, a domain name may have all the characteristics of a trade mark and could found an action for passing off," it added, while quoting from the judgment.
The court said the defendant has chosen neither to file its written statements nor to enter appearance in the suit to defend the same. 
"In my opinion, therefore, this is a fit case where a Summary Judgment in terms of Order XIII-A of the CPC, as applicable to commercial disputes of a specified value, read with Rule 27 of the IPD Rules deserves to be passed in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendant," said Justice Chawla.
Ruling that the plaintiffs have been able to make out a case, the court said, "the Suit is decreed in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendant in terms of prayers made in paragraph nos. 33 (A) and (B) of the plaint. The plaintiff is also held entitled to the costs of the Suit." 
 Case Title: Sporta Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and Another v. Virat Saxena

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) Principal bench comprising of Justice Ashok Bhushan, Ms. Shreesha Merla, Mr. Naresh Salecha in the case of Puneet Kaur versus K V Developers Private Limited has held that the claims of those homebuyers who could not file their claims within stipulated time but the same were reflected in the record of the Corporate Debtor ought to have been included in the information memorandum and the Resolution Applicant ought to have been take note of the same and deal with the in the Resolution Plan.
 NCLAT was adjudicating the appeal filed by homebuyers of KV Developers (KVD) who either filed their claim after the stipulated time period or after the approval of the Resolution Plan by the Committee of Creditors (COC). 
 Brief Facts
 LIC Housing Finance Limited filed an Insolvency Petition against KVD and the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process of KVD was initiated by NCLT vide its order dated 28.10.2020. The Resolution Professional invited claims from creditors on or before 11.11.2020. 
 Resolution Plan submitted by a consortium of Sumit Kumar Khanna and Brij Krishore Trading Pvt. Ltd. (Successful Resolution Applicant/SRA) was put to e-voting from 13.07.2021 to 19.07.2021 and the same was approved by 100% voting by the COC on 20.07.2021 and thereafter, the Resolution Professional filed application before NCLT for approval of the Resolution Plan. 
 One of the Appellant Homebuyers filed its claim on 14.07.2021 (during voting on resolution plan) whereas three Appellant homebuyers filed their claim on 23.07.2021 (after the approval of Resolution Plan by COC) and one Appellant homebuyer filed its claim on 09.11.2021 (after filing of plan approval application before NCLT).
 These Appellant homebuyers filed different interlocutory application before NCLT seeking direction to admit their claims but the same was rejected by NCLT on the ground that claims are filed after a gap of eight months and thus cannot be admitted and the also the COC had approved the Resolution Plan.
 Contentions Of Appellant Homebuyers 
 It was contended on behalf of the Appellant Homebuyers that the thought the Homebuyers did not file their claims but the details of their allotment and payment already existed in the record of the Corporate Debtor and therefore, the Resolution Professional could have included the claims of these homebuyers in the Information Memorandum.
 It was further contended that huge prejudice is caused to homebuyers due to non-inclusion of their claim in Information Memorandum and the Homebuyers shall be treated differently from Financial Creditors.
 Contentions Of The Resolution Professional
 It was contended on behalf of the Resolution Professional all the homebuyers have belatedly filed their claim and subsequent to the approval of the Resolution Plan by the COC. It was also contended that no error has been committed by the Resolution Professional as the claim were filed beyond the period of 90 days as prescribed under the code and furthermore, there is no obligation on the Resolution Professional to specifically informed the Homebuyers to file their claims apart from making publication.
 Contentions of Successful Resolution Applicant 
 The SRA supported the submissions of Resolution Professional and further contended that the Resolution Plan is submitted as per the information memorandum and no new claim can be entertained after the approval of the Resolution Plan. It was also contended that the CIRP is a time bound process and the admission of belated claims will delay the CIRP.
 Issues Framed By NCLAT
 NCLAT framed two questions of law for its consideration that;
 Whether the Resolution Professional was obliged to include the details of Homebuyers as reflected in the records of the Corporate Debtor in the Information Memorandum, even though they have not filed their claim before the Resolution Professional within time?
 Whether Resolution Applicant ought to have also dealt with Resolution Plan regarding Homebuyers, whose names and claims are reflected in the record of the Corporate Debtor, although they have not filed any claim?
 Decision/Analysis by NCLAT
 NCLAT noted that the homebuyers have now been recognised as the Financial Creditors under the IBC and the amendment was brought to mitigate the misery of the homebuyers and to give them participation in the CIRP of a real estate company. 
 NCLAT further observed that due to the procedure prevalent regarding the filing of claims by the Financial Creditors, a large no. of homebuyers are unable to file their claims within time due to various genuine reasons. 
 The Bench ruled that all the documents pertaining to the homebuyers are on record of the Corporate Debtor and the Resolution Professional also takes charge of all the records of the Corporate Debtor. 
  "19…Even though, Interim Resolution Professional/Resolution Professional are not obliged to include the name of such Homebuyers, who have not filed the claim within the time in their List of Creditors, but there is no reason for not collating the claims of such Homebuyers whose claims are reflected from the records of the Corporate Debtor, including their payments and allotment."
 NCLAT further held that Regulation 36(2) of the CIRP regulations obliges the Resolution Professional to include the details of Corporate Debtor regarding assets and liabilities.
 "21…The liability towards those Homebuyers, who have not filed their claim exists and required to be included in the Information Memorandum…"
 The Bench further held that the purpose of CIRP of the Corporate Debtor is to find out all liabilities of the Corporate Debtor and take steps towards resolution and unless all liabilities of the Corporate Debtor are not known or included in the information memorandum, no CIRP will be completed.
 "Non-consideration of such claims, which are reflected from the record, leads to inequitable and unfair resolution as is seen in the present case."
 NCLAT concluded that;
  "23. We thus are of the considered opinion that Information Memorandum ought to have included the claim of those Homebuyers, who have not even filed their claims to correct liabilities of the Corporate Debtor for its appropriate resolution…"
 NCLAT disposed off the appeal by directing the Resolution Professional to submit the details of homebuyers whose details are reflected in the record of the Corporate Debtor to the Successful Resolution Applicant and the SRA shall prepare an addendum to resolution plan which may be placed before the COC for consideration. Bench directed that this exercise to be completed within a period of three months. 
 Counsel for the Appellant : Mr. Mahesh Kumar and Ms. Simran Soni, Advocates.
Counsel for the Respondents: Mr. Abhinav Vasisht, Sr. Advocate with Mr. Rakesh Kumar Bajaj and Mr. Harish Taneja, Advocates for R-1 & 2., Mr. Nitin Kumar and Mr. Gagan Gulati, Advocate for R-3.Mr. Sumesh Dhawan and Ms. Vatsala Kak, Advocates for R-4. 

The Delhi High Court, consisting of Justice Manmohan and Justice Manmeet Preetam Singh Arora, has remanded the matter to the assessing officer for a fresh decision as the department mailed the show cause notice to the wrong email address.
The petitioner/assessee submitted that the department alleged that the petitioner's claim for IGST Refund was incorrect and, hence, the amount "is required to be disallowed." An IGST refund, being a balance sheet item, is not a claim made in the profit and loss account and it cannot be termed as "income chargeable to tax having escaped assessment". Hence, in terms of Section 147 of the Income Tax Act as well as the first proviso to Section 148, the show cause notice was patently illegal.
 The petitioner stated that the order passed under section 148A (d) of the Income Tax Act and the notice issued under section 148 of the Income Tax Act were issued in gross violation of the principles of natural justice. The order does not even mention that the petitioner had filed an application seeking an adjournment so as to enable it to file a reply on merits.
 The petitioner contended that the petitioner became aware of the show cause notice dated March 15, 2022 for the first time on March 24, 2022 as it was sent to the wrong email address. The order reeks of non-application of mind since the order records incorrect facts.
 The department argued that because the petitioner did not have the opportunity to file a reply and the order under Section 148A(d) was not based on merits, the respondent has no objection to the matter being remanded back to the Assessing Officer for a new decision.
 The court directed the petitioner to file its additional reply to the show cause notice issued under Section 148A (b) of the Income Tax Act within two weeks. The Assessing Officer was directed to decide the matter by way of a reasoned order in accordance with the law within eight weeks.
 Case Title: M/s Schneider Electric India Pvt. Ltd. Versus ACIT
 Dated: 01.06.2022
 Counsel For Appellant: Advocate Deepak Chopra
 Counsel For Respondent: Advocate Puneet Rai 

The Kerala High Court on Friday, while allowing the anticipatory bail applications of former Police and Intelligence Bureau officers-including former Gujarat ADGP RB Sreekumar and former Kerala DGP Siby Mathews- in the case relating to the alleged framing of former ISRO scientist Nambi Narayanan in the 1994 ISRO Espionage case, observed that prosecution has failed to prima facie establish any element of conspiracy to hold that a foreign power had a hand in persuading the petitioners in the registration of the two crimes against Narayanan.
When the matter was being heard, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju appearing for the Central Bureau of Investigation had submitted before the Court that the entire conspiracy in ISRO espionage was to derail the development of Cryogenic Technology. ASG further contended that the matter is of serious nature involving national security and foreign powers may be involved in the conspiracy to foist a false case against eminent scientists of ISRO and custodial interrogation was necessary for proper investigation.
Justice K. Babu, after perusing the Case Diary and DK Jain Committee Report, observed that he was unable to find any credible material to prima facie find any elements of conspiracy as contended by the Additional Solicitor General.
I am of the view that the prosecution has so far not prima facie established any element of conspiracy as projected by the learned Additional Solicitor General...have carefully examined the Case Diary and the Justice D.K.Jain Committee Report. I am unable to find any credible material to prima facie find any elements of such conspiracy. There is absolutely no indication or credible material to prima facie hold that a foreign power had a hand in persuading the petitioners/accused in the registration of the two crimes referred to above.
Advocate C Unnikrishnan, appearing for Narayanan, also made a similar submission as that of ASG. The Counsel alleged that the arrest was a part of a larger conspiracy to stall the development of cryogenic rocket technology.
Advocate Kaleeswaram Raj, Counsel appearing for P.S. Jayaprakash on the contrary had contended that Nambi Narayanan had no role in the Cryogenic Project of ISRO at any time.
The Court while considering the question as to whether the prosecution has established the non-bailable offence punishable under Section 120-B of IPC, observed that the following ingredients constitute the offence of criminal conspiracy:
(i)There should be an agreement (concert or league) between two or more persons;
(ii) Such an agreement should be (ii.i) either for doing an illegal act
(ii.ii) or for doing an act by illegal means, (ii.iii) or for breaking the law, i.e., an act which is made punishable by this Code;
Furthermore, the Apex Court in Zakia Ahsan Jafri v. State of Gujarat held that every act of commission and omission would not result in hatching criminal conspiracy unless the acts have been done deliberately and there is meeting of minds of all concerned.
In this case, after perusing the records produced before it, the Court pointed out that even prior to the registration of the crime, the Kerala Police brought in the Central Agencies like Intelligence Bureau and R&AW and allowed them to interrogate Mariyam Rasheeda to ascertain her involvement in espionage without any legal authority and without creating any records on the interrogation. Even after the IB and other Central Agencies had concluded that there was no evidence to show that Mariyam Rasheeda was connected with espionage activities in relation to VSSC scientists, the Kerala Police proceeded with the conclusion of criminality in her connection with the VSSC scientists.
"Even when the Additional Public Prosecutor concerned gave an opinion that it would not be possible to take Ms.Mariyam Rasheeda into police custody, at the directions of the higher authorities ...the Maldivian women were taken into custody, based on the espionage theory, though there was no material on record showing their involvement and thereafter, Sr.D.Sasikumaran was arrested without any material. Sri.Nambi Narayanan and Sri.K.Chandrasekharan were tortured in police custody," the Court noted. 
From the materials produced, the Court inferred that Nambi Narayanan was arrested based on the suspicion that he had attempted to resign from ISRO just after the arrest of one of the Maldivian ladies with intent to join a private firm in France and also in the backdrop of the fact that the Maldivian ladies had contacted two scientists attached to ISRO. The Court said that the aforesaid facts point to the circumstances in which the Kerala Police and the IB at the time of registration of the crime and immediately thereafter before the transfer of the case to CBI, had some suspicion regarding the allegations they raised in the respective FIRs even though ultimately the CBI concluded that the allegations raised by the Kerala Police and the doubt maintained by the IB Officials were false and baseless.
The Court, thereby, observed even though that there is a lack of professionalism in the discharge of duties by the accused especially by the officials of the Kerala Police, no mental element of the accused in the commission of the alleged offences or of their alleged participation in a conspiracy has been established by the CBI. 
What appears from the materials is that there was a glaring lack of professionalism in the discharge of duties by the accused especially by the officials of the Kerala Police. However, the mental element of the accused in the commission of the alleged offences and their alleged participation in a conspiracy as projected by the prosecution is yet to be established by the CBI.
The High Court re-heard the bail applications of the five accused after its earlier orders granting them pre-arrest bail in 2021 were set aside by the Supreme Court in December 2022. The Supreme Court had remanded the matters for fresh decision by the High Court after observing that the previous orders were passed without considering certain aspects.
In the first order granting bail also, the High Court had observed that the arrest of Narayanan was influenced by foreign elements and that the concerns of the Kerala Police at that time cannot be said to be without basis.

The Supreme Court has granted bail to Sandeep Gururaj, Former Deputy General Manager of Manipal Education and Medical Group (MEMG), accused of siphoning off funds (reportedly 62 Crores) from the company accounts.
While granting bail, the court noted that the instant case is not one of public money being involved but monies of the concerned corporate entities. 
"We have given a thought to the matter in issue and in view of the investigation being complete and supplementary charge sheet being filed, we are inclined to grant bail to the appellant who has been in custody for over two years subject to certain terms and conditions", the bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy observed.
Sandeep, while he was working as Deputy General Manager of Manipal Integrated Services Private Limited, allegedly diverted certain amount of Manipal Group Companies and also personal account of the Chairman of Manipal Group Companies in favour of other accused. He was arrested on 26th December 2018.
His first bail application was dismissed by the Karnataka High Court which was confirmed by the Supreme court in March, last year. Thereafter, he again filed another bail application on the ground of changed circumstances, which was also dismissed by the High Court. 
Before the Apex Court, it was contended that he is being made a scapegoat arising from what appeared in public domain in pursuance to what has been called "paradise papers" where the conduct of the management was being called into question in respect of mobilization of resources through offshore entities. Solicitor General opposed his bail plea contending that prima facie case is made out against the appellant, the amounts in question have not been brought back by the appellant, some of the co-accused are absconding and there is a possibility of the appellant fleeing from justice in view of his strong connects outside the country.
"We have given a thought to the matter in issue and in view of the investigation being complete and supplementary charge sheet 3 being filed, we are inclined to grant bail to the appellant who has been in custody for over two years subject to certain terms and conditions. We would not like to further comment on the merits of the controversy as that has the propensity to affect trial. Suffice to say that that the assets in the country of the appellant are attached, his passport is stated to be with the complainant company which shall be deposited in Court and no public money is involved. The fact that the appellant is being called to trial for criminal offences is a matter which would be adjudicated during the criminal trial and the only endeavour can be is to ensure that the appellant remains within the country to face the trial", the court said while granting him bail on terms and conditions to the satisfaction of the trial Court.
Read Order

The Delhi High Court has said that it is imperative for a court to look at a Will from the eyes of a layman rather than a lawman for reaching a final outcome.
A division bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Saurabh Banerjee observed that it is the foremost duty of the Court to carefully give a purposeful meaning to the words and logical interpretation to the language used in a Will to infer and draw the real intention of the testator.
"A Will will be a Will only when it will lay to rest the wishes of who is at rest. We will endeavor to proceed so that the Will of who lays at rest is put to rest," the bench said in the beginning of its ruling dated October 11.
The court observed that as far as possible, all the clauses in a Will must be given equal importance, benefit and uniformity in conjunction with each other and not disjointly.
"The clauses in a Will are like Sailors on a ship sailing in the same direction. Each clause has an individual value like each Sailor has an individual role to play. Thus, a Will has to be harmoniously construed under all circumstances," said the court.
At the outset, the court noted that disputes regarding interpretation of a Will have been knocking the legal doors since time immemorial and though such doors have been successfully closed by numerous pronouncements, but, unfortunately the said issue will always be burning as there can be no closure to it.
Since a meaning is sought to be given to the testator's intention as to what he must have meant when he was alive while making the Will, due importance has to be given to the surrounding circumstances including the testator's background, status and relations with the family and society, the court said.
"The purpose must be to derive the real intention of the testator and recognize the dispositive rights of the beneficiaries for reaching a conclusion as far as practically possible. The Court is to look behind the cloak and lift the veil," it added.
Furthermore, the court observed that a Will has to be read as a whole, adding that any contradictions, inconsistencies or variations have to be brought to variance with each other on a level playing field. 
"The intention ought to be inferred from the words and the language used in the Will without reading into them or drawing any preconceived notion and without tinkering with the basic structure of the Will for deciphering their true literal meaning. The words in the Will ought to be given a plain, simple and grammatical meaning as per Dictionary without any if(s) or but(s)," said the court.
The court also said some clause(s) in the Will are or can be overstepping on each other and as the same cannot be altered or no explanation can be sought from the testator. 
"It should be made sure that such clause(s) do not trample upon each other so as to negate any one of them. In case the clause(s) are inconsistent and a divergent meaning is possible, the order of precedence should be followed, i.e., the more powerful/meaningful clause(s) is to take precedence over the less meaningful clause(s)," the bench said.
The court also opined that when a Will contains a clause bequeathing absolute rights, then the same cannot be followed by other clauses with restricted rights. It observed that an absolute right is an outright recognition which cannot be fettered by imposing a condition in the form of a restrictive right. 
"Where words in a clause can be interpreted in more than one way, it would be in the interest of things to choose and give the best possible, plausible, constructive meaning in the overall interest of everybody so as to draw a "single straight line‟ with no breakers rather than falling back on something which is implausibly destructive against the interest of everybody. In such situations, the meaning which furthers the cause ought to be chosen rather than which goes against the cause," the court said.
It added, "The Court steps into the shoes of a kapellmeister and at the end of the day as everybody likes a melodious song, it is the duty of the Court to choose the music which is ears to the soul."
Furthermore, the bench observed that the words and clauses of the same Will must not be picked or chosen out of context, adding that all the words must be regarded as essential whereas all the clauses should be reconciled with each other and must be read together 'as being part and parcel of the same document'.
However, the court added that in case where it is not possible to do the same, a more beneficial interpretation should be adopted so as to bring a hiatus to the conflicting situation. 
The court made the observations in a case related to a will declaring that the house shall belong to all the four children with each having 25 percent share in the property.
Title: VIKRANT KAPILA & ANR. v. PANKAJA PANDA & ORS.

The Gujarat High Court while allowing the petition against the order of detention of the Petitioner has held that offences under Section 27 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Sections 30 and 35 of the Gujarat Medical Practitioner Act by itself cannot bring the detenu within the fold of the Gujarat Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act, 1985.
 The detenu had contested that illegal activity likely to be carried out or alleged to have been carried out could not have any nexus or bearing with the maintenance of public order and at the most, it could be said to be a breach of law and order. It could not be said that the activities of the detenu had 'affected the tempo of the society' or caused threat to the very existence of the normal and routine life of the people at large. The activities did not disrupt the rule of law by disturbing public order.
 Per contra, the AGP supported the detention by submitting that the detenu was in the habit of indulging in such activities and thus his activities could be brought under Section 2(c) of the Anti-Social Activities Act. 
 Justice S Vora and Justice Sandeep Bhatt opined that the detention cannot be legal, valid and in accordance with law since the offences registered against the detenu could be dealt with under the provisions of the relevant penal laws and the relevant legislation. The Bench remarked:
 "Unless and until, the material is there to make out a case that the person has become a threat and menace to the Society so as to disturb the whole tempo of the society and that all social apparatus is in peril disturbing public order at the instance of such person, it cannot be said that the detenue is a person within the meaning of section 2(c) of the Act."
 There was no evidence on record to show that the acts of the detune had disturbed the whole tempo of the society or disrupted public order as within the meaning of Section 2(c) of the Act, per the Bench. Reference was made to Pushker Mukherjee v/s. State of West Bengal [AIR 1970 SC 852] to provide the distinction between 'law and order' and 'public order':
 "In this connection we must draw a line of demarcation between serious and aggravated forms of disorder which directly affect the community or injure the public interest and the relatively minor breaches of peace of a purely local significance which primarily injure specific individuals and only in a secondary sense public interest. A mere disturbance of law and order leading to disorder is thus not necessarily sufficient for action under the Preventive Detention Act but a disturbance which will affect public order comes within the scope of the Act."
 Accordingly, the petition was allowed and the order of detention was quashed. 
 Case Title: SUBHASHCHANDRA SANATAN MALLIK THROUGH BABITA SUBHASHCHANDRA MALLIK v/s STATE OF GUJARAT

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has recently ruled that the insurer cannot escape its liability to pay compensation to the claimants on the ground that the legal heirs of the deceased owner were not made parties to the claim petitions.
A bench of Justice Sanjay Dhar made these observations while hearing a bunch of appeals in terms of which the appellant insurance company had assailed the award passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Jammu. 
The appellant challenged the impugned award on the grounds that the claimants had not impleaded the legal heirs of deceased owner of the offending vehicle as party to the claim petitions and hence the claim petitions were not maintainable. 
Appellants submitted that the owner cum driver of the offending vehicle had died in the same accident and the claimants, after deleting him from array of the parties, did not take steps to implead his LRs, thereby rendering the claim petitions and the consequent award untenable under law. 
Appellants further contended that since no FIR relating to the accident was registered by the concerned Police Station, hence the accident was not established.
Deliberating on the primary ground of the appeal, Justice Dhar observed that Section 155 of the Motor Vehicles Act is amply clear that if the death of an insured has occurred after the happening of accident which has given rise to a claim, the same would continue to survive against the estate of the insured or against the insurer. 
In order to address the question as to whether, in the face of aforesaid provision, the present claim petitions without impleading the LRs of the deceased owner as parties, are maintainable, the bench referred to an earlier pronouncement of the coordinate bench of the J&K High Court in Bajaj Allianz General. Insurance. Co. Ltd. vs. Naresh Kumar and another 2021 wherein it was held that Section 155 of the Act of 1988 clearly states that in case of death of the person, in whose favour a certificate of insurance had been issued, after the happening of the accident, which gave rise to filing of claim petition cannot bar the proceedings and, therefore, proceedings do not abate. 
Deliberating further on the argument of the appellant that since the insured had died in the same accident which was the subject matter of the claim petitions, as such, Section 155 of the Act of 1988 would not come to the rescue of claimants, the bench observed that the said argument is misconceived for the reason that, in section 155 of the Act, the expression used is “if it occurs after the happening of an event which has given rise to a claim” which implies that if death of the insured has taken place after the accident which gives rise to cause of action for filing a claim petition, the petition can survive against the insurer without impleading the legal heirs of the owner.
Applying the said position of law to the instant matter the court said that no doubt, death of the insured has taken place in the same accident which has given rise to cause of action in favour of the claimants, but it cannot be stated that death of the owner had taken place prior to the accident. 
"His death certainly took place after the occurrence of the accident and not prior to that, so, at the time of the accident, the certificate of insurance issued by the appellant-Insurance company in favour of the deceased owner was in force. Therefore, provisions of Section 155 of the Act would certainly save the claim petitions filed by the claimants in the instant case", the bench underscored. 
Declining the other contention of the appellant that no FIR had been registered in thd matter and hence the accident was not established, Justice Dhar observed that the police has conducted the inquest proceedings under Section 174 of Cr.P.Cand merely because FIR was not registered, but only inquest proceedings were conducted by the police, it cannot be stated that the occurrence has not been proved .
Accordingly the bench found the appeal devoid of any merit and dismissed the same. 
Case Title: IFFCO TOKIO General Insurance Co. Ltd Vs Om Prakash. 

In a relief to the Chief Minister of Jharkhand Hemant Soren, the Supreme Court on Monday held that the Public Interest Litigation petitions filed in the Jharkhand High Court seeking probe against him for alleged money laundering are not maintainable.
The Top Court set aside the order of the High Court which held as maintainable the PILs which sought probe against Soren for alleged money laundering through shell companies and obtaining a mining lease while he was in power.
The order was reserved by a bench comprising Chief Justice of India Uday Umesh Lalit, Justice S Ravindra Bhat and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia. Justice Dhulia, who pronounced the judgment today, stated that the Court has allowed the appeals moved by Jharkhand State government and CM Soren assailing the High Court's order which accepted maintainability of the PILs. The State and the CM moved the Supreme Court after the High Court accepted the sealed cover documents produced by the Enforcement Directorate in the PILs.
"We have allowed the appeals holding that the PILs are not maintainable", Justice Dhulia stated. The judgment is yet to be uploaded.
During the hearing, Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal appearing for State government submitted an array of submissions which included, showcasing the questionable conduct of the original petitioner, how the High Court looked into the merits of the matter despite the Supreme Court order which asked it to consider maintainability first and how the Enforcement Directorate produced materials in a sealed cover without there being any incriminating evidence against Soren.
Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi for the CM Soren submitted how no credentials were shown to the satisfaction of the court , how the petitioner and his advocate suppressed the PILs that were filed by them and how there was no prima facie satisfaction of the High Court in the matter.
Countering these submissions, Additional Solicitor General SV Raju, appearing for the Enforcement Directorate argued the petitions which raise serious issues of criminal activities should not be thrown out on the technical grounds.
The Supreme Court, on May 23, had directed the Jharkhand High Court to first decide the maintainability of three PILs seeking CBI/ED investigation against Jharkhand CM Soren in relation to grant of mining lease, allegations of MNREGA scam and transfer of money into shell companies.
State of Jharkhand v. Shiv Shankar Sharma| SLP(C) 10622/2022, Hemant Soren v. Shiv Shankar Sharma SLP(C) No.11364-11365/2022

The Allahabad High Court on Monday directed the private schools to adjust/pay back the excess money (15% of the total fee) that was charged from students during the COVID Pandemic period (2020-21 session).
 The bench of Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice J. J. Munir ordered thus while hearing a bunch of petitions filed by aggrieved parents from all over the State seeking regulation of fees in all government and private schools in Uttar Pradesh.
 The grievance raised by the petitioners was that certain facilities were not provided during the COVID-19 pandemic hence they are not liable to pay for that. 
 Appearing for the petitioners, Advocates Shashwat Anand and Yanendra Pandey argued that fees is a matter of quid pro quo and during the 2020-21 session, no services, except online tuition, were provided in private schools.
 Hence, it was submitted that charging even a single rupee over and above the tuition fee by private schools was nothing but profiteering and commercialization of education. 
 In support of their contentions, the counsels had cited the 2021 judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Indian School, Jodhpur Vs. State Of Rajasthan LL 2021 SC 240 wherein it was held that private schools demanding fees without providing any services amounts to profiteering and commercialization of education.
 In fact, in this very case, the Top Court had, instead of relegating the parties to any regulatory authority to refix the school fee for the academic year 2020-21, balanced the equities by issuing a one-time direction for the academic year 2020-21 that the fee payable by the students shall be 15% less than what was paid for the academic year 2019-20. 
 The court had also ordered that if any excess had been paid, the same would have to be adjusted in the fee to be paid in future.
 Taking note of the Apex Court’s judgment and referring to the directions issued therein, the High Court, in its order, directed the private school that in case any fee has been paid in excess of what has been determined by the Supreme Court in the Indian School case (supra) judgment, in the case of the students still studying, the same may be adjusted in the fee to be paid in future. 
 In the case of students who have passed out or left the school, the Court has ordered that the amount may be calculated and returned to those students. As per the court’s order, this exercise has to be done within two months.
 In other words, as per the order of the High Court, all the schools will have to calculate 15% of the total fees charged during the year 2020-21 and adjust the same in the academic next session. 
 As far as the students who have left the schools are concerned, 15% of the said fees will have to be refunded to them.

 Considering that if not used timely, the Remdesivir injections are likely to go waste, the Court deemed it appropriate to direct the State authorities to get the seized Remdesivir injections tested through the State Forensic Science Laboratory or any other appropriate agency, to find out whether or not, the drugs, which have been seized, are genuine Remdesivir injections. Further, the Court directed, 
 "…to the extent the seized vials of the Remdesivir are found to be genuine, the Chief Medical & Health Officer of the concerned district would make an application before the appropriate Court for taking delivery of such seized drugs, which shall pass the required orders in that behalf, within a period of three days from the date of filing of the application, so that the medicine can be provided to needy patients before its expiry." Apart from this, the Amicus Curiae Naman Nagrath stated 76 ventilators at Bundelkhand Medical College, Sagar; 24 ventilators at Government Hospital, Shahdol; 2 ventilators at Alirajpur; 2 ventilators at Katni are either lying uninstalled or unused. He further submitted that most of these ventilators could not be used on account of the non-availability of expert technicians. To this, Mr. P.K. Kaurav, Advocate General submitted efforts are being made to make all these ventilators functional in the entire State and he undertook to apprise the Court about the current situation of these and other ventilators lying at Alirajpur and Katni on the next date of hearing.

The Gauhati High Court, while hearing an appeal against a judgment of a Civil Court, has held that agreement of settlement arrived at Lok Adalat is deemed a decree of a civil court and as such it is binding upon the parties.
It further held that no appeal lies against it to any court and if any party wants 
to challenge such an award based on settlement, it can be done only by filing a petition under Article 226 and/or Article 227 of the Constitution.
Background
The Court was hearing a civil appeal challenging an order of the civil court, which had in effect reversed the settlement arrived at between parties at the Lok Adalat.The parties were siblings involved in a family property dispute. At the Lok Adalat it was agreed that the sister is the owner of the property. However, later, the brother 
filed a Declaratory Suit before the civil court claiming ownership of the suit land. The civil court eventually allowed the suit.
Hence, the sister moved the High Court in present appeal.Findings
At the outset, the High Court noted that the award passed by Lok Adalat was duly signed by both parties and there was no allegation of duress or fraud. Thus, a settlement was arrived at amicably between the parties as envisaged in section 21 of the Legal Services Authority Act, 1987.In appreciating the above provision of law, the Court observed that in the instant cases the parties have clearly come to an amicable settlement and the award is deemed a decree of a civil court which, if not duly executed by any of the parties can be filed in the court concerned with a request to execute it.
In this backdrop, it remarked,"if any of the parties is aggrieved by the award of Lok Adalat for genuine reasons, the remedy available would be by filing a petition under Article 226 and/or Article 227 of the Constitution as has been held by the Apex Court in State of Pubjaband Another -vs- Jalour Singh and Others."
Accordingly, the appeal was disposed of.

The Rajasthan High Court has directed a woman, who was married off while a minor and now wishes to part her ways, to file a representation before the Superintendent of Police, Jodhpur (Rural) for appropriate security. 
Notably, the woman has approached the court with the grievance that her parents are pressuring her to live with the person with whom her marriage was solemnised while she was a child. She argued that such marriage was illegal, as she was not of marriageable age at the relevant time.
Moreover, the woman informed the court that though she wants to pursue her studies, her family members would get her arrested or forcefully take her to her village and restrict her movement due to which she would be unable to complete her studies.
Justice Dinesh Mehta, observed,
"Having regard to the apprehension expressed by the petitioner that her parents and family members will intrude in her life and liberty, instant petition is being disposed of with a direction to the petitioner to file a representation before the Superintendent of Police, Jodhpur (Rural) for appropriate security so as to enable her to take up her examinations at Jaipur which are going to be scheduled from 11.06.2022 to 06.07.2022."
The court ordered that if any such representation is made by the woman, then the Superintendent of Police, Jodhpur (Rural) shall consider the same, in accordance with law.

The Supreme Court observed that no one can be permitted to take the benefit of the wrong order passed by the court which has been subsequently set aside by the higher forum/court.
In this case, some excess amount were paid to writ petitioners (applicants for the course of General Nursing Training) pursuant to the order passed by the Single bench of the High Court, which was subsequently set aside by the Division Bench. While allowing the appeal, the Division Bench also directed that the State shall be at liberty to recover the excess amount paid to the original writ petitioners during their period of training as a period of leave permissible to him/her in easy equal installments. Against this direction, the writ petitioners approached the Apex Court.
Dismissing the appeal, the court noted that the amount paid in excess has to be refunded and/or returned by the original writ petitioners and the State is entitled to recover from them on the principle of restitution. Referring to the principle of Restitution, the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna observed:
"The restitution principle recognizes and gives shape to the idea that advantages secured by a litigant, on account of orders of court, at his behest, should not be perpetuated... In the case of Ouseph Mathai v. M. Abdul Khadir, reported in (2002) 1 SCC 319, it is observed and held that after the dismissal of the lis, the party concerned is relegated to the position which existed prior to the filing of the petition in the court which had granted the stay. . Even otherwise, no one can be permitted to take the benefit of the wrong order passed by the court which has been subsequently set aside by the higher forum/court. As per the settled position of law, no party should be prejudiced because of the order of the court."
Dismissing the appeal, the court directed that whatever amount is paid in excess to the original writ petitioners shall be recovered from the original writ petitioners in thirty-six equal monthly installments, to be deducted from their salary commencing from April, 2022.

The Allahabad High Court on Wednesday upheld the life sentence awarded to an accused in connection with the murder of an eight-time National Badminton Champion Syed Modi, who represented India in various international championships.
The Bench of Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Saroj Yadav took into the record the evidence adduced before it to conclude that Modi was killed by firing made by convict/appellant along with one another accused by using fire arm.
The case in brief 
On July 28, 1988, Modi came to play badminton in the badminton hall situated inside the stadium of Lucknow. After playing, when he was going back on his scooter, somebody fired upon him with the intention to kill him. 
One Prem Chand Yadav (P.W. 9) who was working in the canteen at the gate, came to him raising an alarm and told him that two persons were running in a white color Maruti Car after firing upon Syed Modi. He was taken to the Medical College in an injured condition where the doctor declared him dead.
The investigation of the case was transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation. After investigation, CBI came to the conclusion that Sanjay Singh, Ameeta Kulkarni Modi, Akhilesh Singh, Amar Bahadur Singh, Bhagwati Singh alias Pappu (applicant), Jitendra Singh alias Tinku and Balai Singh were the miscreants who were behind the commission of murder of Modi.
However, the Court of Sessions discharged accused Sanjay Singh and Ameeta Kulkarni Modi and that order of discharge of Sanjay Singh and Ameeta Kulkarni Modi was upheld first by the High Court and thereafter by the Supreme Court.
Accused Akhilesh Singh was also discharged and Accused Balai Singh Amar Bahadur Singh were murdered and the case against him stood abated. Now only, two accused were left to be tried namely Bhagwati Singh alias Pappu (present applicant) and Jitendra Singh alias Tinku.
Later on, Pappu was convicted under Section 120-B of I.P.C. and Section 302 of I.P.C. read with Section 34 of I.P.C by sessions court. Challenging the same, he moved to the High Court.
Arguments put forth
It was argued by him that there was no evidence against him, he was not named in the FIR, and his name allegedly surfaced on the basis of the statement of one Prem Chand Yadav who, after about one month identified the convict in the jail during test identification parade.
It was also argued that there was no motive for the convict/appellant to commit the murder of the deceased and the car (allegedly used by miscreants) was found belonging to one Mr. Akhilesh Singh against whom charges were framed, but the High Court quashed the charges against him.
Court's observations 
The Court noted that the evidence of PW9 Prem Chand Yadav showed that he remained resolute and undeterred. The Court observed that while most of the witnesses of facts turned hostile, he (PW9) remained unswayed even in the condition when he was recalled after a gap of about four years of recording of his examination-in-chief that too in a condition when he became blind and one of his foot was amputated up to the heel.
"This witness has again and again reaffirmed that he saw the convict alongwith one another person firing upon the deceased Syed Modi. Nothing could be brought in his evidence by the defence counsel in crossexamination so as to create doubt on his testimony. This witness stood during his examination-in-chief and also cross examination unswayed, unyielded, and unbended. The direct evidence of this witness is sufficient enough to hold the convict/appellant guilty of committing the murder of Syed Modi."
Regarding the identification of the convict by PW9, the Court noted that he knew the convict prior to the incident by appearance but not by name because he used to come to the stadium occasionally. 
He said that he was the first person who informed the Officer working in the stadium about the incident after witnessing the incident, thereafter, he identified the convict/appellant in jail during the test identification parade, and finally, he identified the convict/appellant before the trial court while deposing in the case.
Further, the Court noted that in spite of his inability to see the witness, he stressed that he correctly identified the convict during his previous statement made in the Court and also confirmed that he saw the killers of Syed Modi by his own eyes. His testiomony was also corraborated by the medical evidence.
Consequently, the court came to the conclusion that the deceased Syed Modi was killed by firing made by convict/appellant alongwith one another accused by using fire arm in contravention of Section 5 of the Arms Act, which is punishable under Section 27 of the Arms Act.
Hence, the conviction and sentence of the convict/appellant awarded by the trial court punishable under Section 302/34 of I.P.C. and under Section 27 of the Arms Act was confirmed and upheld.

"One aspect of this report is to give us another narrative on the person who has been convicted of a crime is.""This report points out that you need to acknowledge the person you are dealing with at least at the stage of sentencing that person to death."
Orissa High Court Chief Justice Justice Muralidhar made the above remarks at a panel discussion organized to mark the release of Project 39A's report on Mental Health and Death Penalty called 'Deathworthy: A mental health perspective of the death penalty.' The report presents empirical data on the existence of psychiatric illnesses and intellectual disability among death row prisoners the psychological consequences of living on death row. The report finds that an overwhelming majority of death row prisoners interviewed (62.2%) had a mental illness and 11% had an intellectual disability. The report documents instances of adverse childhood experiences- childhood abuse, physical assault, childhood neglect, the sudden death of close one, deviant peers, disturbed family environment, low educational attainment in their life.
 Pointing out the report's finding that at least 62.2% of the death row convicts have been diagnosed with a mental illness, Ms Maitreyi Misra, the lead author of the report, pointed out: "These individuals are already entering the prisons as already vulnerable individuals…being on the death row adds an additional layer of trauma." She further pointed out that the findings of 'Deathworthy' raise questions over the ability of the legal system of to accurately hold people worthy of the death penalty given the findings on mental disability of death row prisoners. The objective of the report, she explained, was to have a conversation over the question of whether we want to inflict pain in the garb of justice.
 Dr Pratima Murthy, Director NIMHANS, referred to the evidence of pre-existing intellectual disability, child abuse, lack of parental care and support, and socio-economic adversity among the death row prisoners and offered her insights that "multiple and long-term exposures to negative events can increase the risk to psychiatric illness and have an effect on subsequent behaviour." Professor Murthy pointed out that the Deathworthy report underscored the need not only for the judiciary but also for society to approach these issues with more nuance.
 Talking about the effect of incarceration on mental health, Professor Sanjeev Jain, Senior Professor, Deptt of Psychiatry, NIMHANS, pointed out the debilitating impact that having to spend a lifetime on death row can have on the mental health of convicts. 
"When mercy petitions are left pending for years along with forced to live a life of social isolation produces long term damage to the brain leading to high rates of mental distress, anxiety and suicidal tendencies. This is kind of unnecessary mental cruelty": he shared. 
 Justice S. Muralidhar, Chief Justice of the Orissa High Court, spoke about the need to look at the accused as an individual and the complexity of the exercise of death sentencing. Recalling a lecture delivered by Justice Albie Sachs in 1998 where he talked about the four kinds of truths- logical, experiential, dialogic and microscopic- Justice Muralidhar explained that microscopic truth is what judges arrive at through the process of a trial.
"A trial will exclude things that are not relevant, what evidence is admissible…don't allow witnesses to answer except yes and no to many close-ended questions. Many of the things which would otherwise become essential for appreciating what happened somehow gets excluded in the process of law because we are strict about the law of evidence, Criminal Procedure Code and how you interpret the law."
 This, tendency of the law to keep out things that are considered irrelevant deprive the judges of the perspective of the accused, he opined. 
 He further expressed that the Deathworthy report has a Rashomon like effect in providing a fresh perspective to the issue.
"When a same event is looked at from four different angles, you get four different narratives. One aspect of this report is to give us another narrative on the person who has been convicted of a crime is."  "This report points out that you need to acknowledge the person you are dealing with at least at the stage of sentencing that person to death."
 Within the framework of the law as it exists, he explained that the death penalty sentencing framework provided an opportunity for the judge to undertake a searching enquiry into an individual's life and look at them as an individual in their own right without comparing them to multitude others on which there is no real information. 
 Elaborating further, Justice Muralidhar explained that there the criminal law jurisprudence accommodates the concern that we need to get to know the criminal or the accused than just the nature of the crime committed via the triumvirate structure of the crime test, the criminal test and the rarest of the rare test. "The Apex Court has, starting with Bachan Singh and a host of other judgements, developed a complex set of factors that need to be considered by the court while at the stage of awarding death sentence", he explained. 
 He also pointed out the longstanding dialogue that has existed between law and psychiatry from the passing of the Lunacy Act to the Sheela Barse Case. He expressed his belief that this dialogue needs to be carried forward.
 Drawing attention to the recent order of the Supreme Court in Manoj Jain v State of Madhya Pradesh where a 3 judge bench called for psychiatric evaluation of the prisoners on death row, Justice Muralidhar hoped that there would be more such exercises in the future. 
 Speaking a judge, he shared that it has been his experience that the death sentencing exercise is a complex exercise for a judge to undertake. 
 "It's a very difficult task for the judge to perform. I think we need input from the field of psychiatry…we need to have a 360 degree understanding of the victim, the accused, the victim's family perspective."
 However, he pointed out that sentencing rightly should be a complex exercise because the sentences are irreversible in nature. 
 "Sentencing should be a socio-legal exercise and take into account a 360 degree understanding of the victim's perspective, the victim's family perspective, the accused's history and the wider impact of the society at large", he concluded.

Observing that Veterinary Doctors are at par with Medical Doctors, the Himachal Pradesh High Court on Thursday ruled that State cannot deny the grant of 4-tier pay scale to the Veterinary Officers on a flimsy ground, that they are dealing with animals and the doctors serving in the Health and Family Welfare Department are dealing with humans.
The observations were made by a bench comprising Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Mr. Justice Virender Singh, while hearing a bunch of petitions challenging cabinet decision of not granting 4 tier pay scale to the petitioner veterinary officers. 
The petitioners, holding Bachelor’s degrees in Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry (B.V.Sc. & AH) had been appointed as Veterinary Officers on contract basis whereafter their services got regularized. 
In consonance with the 4 tier pay scale guidelines formulated by the Finance department the length of service of each officer was to be determined on the basis of completion of 4, 9 and 14 years of service counted from the initial date of regularization in service. 
However, the respondent-State while counting such service had ignored the service rendered by the petitioners prior to regularization on contract basis unlike their counterparts, who fall within the categories of H.P. Health Services Class-I (General List) and H.P. Health Services Class-I (Dental). This in turn had constrained the petitioners to file these writ petitions. 
In their petition, the petitioners prayed for directions upon the respondents to count the service rendered by the petitioners on contract basis before their respective regularization be counted for the purpose of grant of benefit under 4, 9,14 years (Assured Carrier Progression Scheme) pay scale on the pattern the same has been extended to other Medical Officers (General), Medical Officers (Dental) and Veterinary Officers (Regular). 
Per contra, respondents submitted that the contractual services of the petitioners (Veterinary Officers appointed on contract basis) on the analogy of Medical Officers (appointed on contract basis) in the Health and Family Welfare Department for the purpose of granting 4-tier pay scale cannot be counted as the petitioners are dealing with animals, whereas the Doctors of Health Department are dealing with humans where stakes are much higher and the duties and responsibilities are round the clock and thus are not equivalent. 
After considering the rival contentions the bench referred toDr. Arun Sirkeck and Ors. vs. State of Himachal Pradesh, decided 2009, when this Court had observed that that the Veterinary Officers appointed on contract basis cannot be discriminated by the State by not counting the ad-hoc service at par with the Medical Officers serving in the Himachal Pradesh Health Services Class-I (Generalist) and (Dental) and accordingly, the State had been directed to count the services of the Veterinary Officers on adhoc basis for all intents and purposes.
Observing that since this court has already recognized parity between MBBS doctors and Veterinary Officers in the matters of counting of ad-hoc service and also grant of NPA to the Veterinary Officers at par with the MBBS doctors, the bench decimated the denial of grant of 4-tier pay scale to the Veterinary Officers that too on the flimsy ground that the petitioners are dealing with animals and the doctors serving in the Health and Family Welfare Department are dealing with humans. 
Pointing out to the discrimination meted out by the state by denial of due benefits to the petitioners the court said that we have no hesitation in concluding that the respondent-State while denying the benefit of 4-tier pay scale to the petitioners from the initial date of appointment at par with the medical officers have indulged in hostile discrimination and thereby violated Article 14 of the Constitution of India. 
Accordingly, the impugned decision taken by the cabinet rejecting the claim of the petitioners was quashed and set aside. The respondent-State is directed to count the services rendered by the petitioners contract basis before their respective regularization for the purpose of benefit under 4-tier pay scale on the same pattern as has been extended to the Medical Officers (Generalist) and (Dental) and Veterinary Officers (Regular), the bench concluded. 
Case Title: Pankaj Kumar Lakhanpal & ors Vs State of HP & Ors. 

The Kerala High Court recently directed the Guruvayur Devaswom Managing Committee to ensure that any entry restrictions imposed into the Nalambalam of Guruvayur Sree Krishna Temple are strictly complied with and are not flouted by any individual, including its members, Administrators or former officers.
The Division Bench of Justice Anil K. Narendran and Justice P.G Ajithkumar also ruled that a worshipper was bound to exercise their right to worship subject to the traditions and restrictions in place. 
"Right to worship is a civil right, of course in an accustomed manner and subject to the practise and tradition in each temple. A 'worshipper', who shows reverence and adoration for Lord Guruvayurappan, is duty-bound to exercise his right to worship in an accustomed manner and subject to the practise and tradition in Guruvayur Sree Krishna Temple. He is duty-bound to obey the restrictions, if any, imposed by the Managing Committee."
The Court was adjudicating upon a suo moto case registered after a former administrator of the Managing Committee and two of its members entered the Nalambalam in 2021 violating the decision imposing absolute restrictions on the entry of devotees into the premises for Vishukani darshan. The current Administrator had initially lodged a complaint about the incident to the Station House Officer which was later withdrawn. Therefore, no further action was taken in the matter.
The Court observed that it is the duty of the Committee to arrange for the proper performance of the rites and ceremonies in the temple and to provide facilities for the proper performance of worship by the worshippers. Therefore, it was held that when entry restrictions are imposed based on the decision taken by the Managing Committee, its members, the Administrator or hereditary employees cannot flout such restrictions and they are bound to obey any such restrictions.
The Court also expressed its displeasure over the fact that no security staff in the temple had prevented them from entering the Nalambalam. This implied that the entry restrictions imposed by the Managing Committee were being flouted openly in the presence of the security staff in the temple and that they could not control it effectively. 
Hence, it was found that the Managing Committee had committed a grave irregularity by not taking any action against them. The Committee's decision to withdraw the complaint made by the Administrator was never brought to the notice of the Court though it was reported to the Registrar General. The Bench strongly deprecated this conduct of the Managing Committee which failed to discharge its statutory duties.
The Court had also enquired about the action taken against the entry of actor Mohanlal's vehicle into the premises through the northern gate in 2021 allegedly in the presence of three members of the Managing Committee. This incident had ignited controversy on social media. 
It was found that restricted vehicle entry is permitted through southern and northern gates. From the statements of the security personnel, it was discerned that a class of worshippers are permitted to bring their vehicles up to Bhagavathy Temple, through the Nadapathal, with the active support of the Members of the Managing Committee or the Administrator. 
The Bench opined that Nadapanthal is not intended for the movement of worshippers in vehicles since it will cause inconvenience to other worshippers and that such practice should be suspended instantly:
"Restricted entry of vehicles through the northern gate, causing least inconvenience to the worshippers moving through the Nadapathal, can be permitted for disabled persons or aged persons with restricted movement. Similarly, restricted movement of vehicles for the supply of articles to the temple for offerings .. can also be permitted. In addition to this, the movement of ambulance through Nadapanthal, in case of emergency, can also be permitted. However, the practise of permitting a class of worshippers to bring their vehicles upto Bhagavathy Temple, through the Nadapathal, with the active support of the members of the Managing Committee or the Administrator, has to be stopped with immediate effect."
As such, the matter was disposed of. 
Case Title: Suo Motu v. The Managing Committee & Ors. 

The Orissa High Court has recently held that the homicidal nature of death need not always be proved through direct evidence. A Division Bench of Chief Justice S. Muralidhar and Justice B.P. Routray noted that a homicidal death must be inferred from the circumstances and the nature of injuries noticed on the dead body.
The observation was made in an appeal preferred by a man convicted for the murder of his wife and sentenced to life imprisonment. He had argued that in the absence of specific opinion concerning the exact time of death and nature of injuries homicidal nature of the deceased is not proved.
Noting that the instant case is about the death of a wife committed by the husband within four walls of the house., the Court noticed that the alleged murder was committed in the absence of any other adult member in the house except the deceased and Appellant. It was noted that the external features of the dead body, as seen during the inquest and post-mortem examination, speak of homicidal death. Further, the two fractures noticed on the skull over the temporoparietal bone and occipital bone support the prosecution's case about the assault on the head of the deceased by means of any blunt object. 
It was held that when the assailant is the husband, and he tried his best to screen the evidence by attempting to burn the dead body after committing the offence, it is difficult to get direct evidence on the nature of the injuries. The Court concluded that the deceased died homicidal death by noting that, 
"It should not be forgotten here that, the inquest and post mortem examination were conducted after a clear gap of three days of the occurrence and keeping the same in mind, the features noticed on the dead body of the deceased, external as well as internal, are found supportive with the conclusion of homicidal death of the deceased. It is thus concluded that the deceased died homicidal nature death."
On the evidence of eye-witnesses, who are the appellant's children, the Court noted that since they are child witnesses, their assault evidence could not be believed as they have admitted to having heard the same from another 12-year-old boy. However, the 12-year-old's evidence was clear, compelling, trustworthy, and corroborated by medical evidence.
The court noted that no allegation of tutoring those child witnesses is there. It remarked that the law is well settled that while appreciating the evidence of a child witness, the court must be cautious enough to examine any possibility of tutoring the child. It noted, 
"Section 118 of the Evidence Act speaks that every person is a competent witness unless the court considers them incompetent due to lack of understanding to give rational answers either by tender years or for any other reason. Whether a child is competent enough to understand the questions and answer them rationally depends on the facts of each case."
Dismissing the appeal, it was held that there is direct and cogent evidence concerning the assault further substantiated by the accused's conduct, clearly establishing murder charges under Section 302/201 of the IPC against the appellant.

In an important direction, the Allahabad High Court recently instructed the Advocate General for the State of Uttar Pradesh to not accept any case diary unless a certificate is appended to the same by the Investigating Officer that complete original or true copy of the same is being produced.
 The Bench of Justice Vivek Agarwal has further directed the Addl. Advocate General to communicate the copy of the order to all the Superintendents Of Police for its immediate compliance w.e.f. August 16, 2021. 
 The Court was hearing the plea of a constable accused under the POCSO Act wherein he claimed that he was at the place of his duty during the commission of the crime.
 He relied upon the information received by him under the Right to Information Act, that he was on duty as traffic police personnel (during the relevant time of the incident) and that his duty timings were from 3:00 to 10:00 pm at Ghaziabad and he was dispatched for duty at 2:00 pm.
 However, the advocate for the private respondent, on the other hand, argued that as per the probe of the Investigating Officer, the location of the mobile number carried by the accused was found close to the place of the incident.
 However, when the Government Advocate was asked to supply a copy of the Purcha No. SCD-02 enclosed with the case diary (in which the presence of the accused near the place of the incident was claimed), it was submitted that the complete case diary had not been sent to the office of Advocate General.
 In this backdrop, the Addl. Advocate General was requested by the Court to look into the matter and the Court directed thus:
 "…the office of Advocate General shall not accept any case diary unless a certificate is appended by the Investigating Officer of the case that he is producing a complete original or true copy of the case diary containing pages from 1 to ....along with an Index of the documents which form part of the case diary, and in case it is found that incomplete case diary is accepted without the endorsement of the I.O. causing inconvenience to the court and wastage of precious time then the office of Advocate General may be held responsible and consequences may follow"

The Bombay High Court has ruled that an order granting permission or sanction to prosecute an individual under the Prevention of Corruption Act must demonstrate that the Sanctioning Authority has applied his mind and not passed the order "mechanically".

The Bombay High Court has ruled that an order granting permission or sanction to prosecute an individual under the Prevention of Corruption Act must demonstrate that the Sanctioning Authority has applied his mind and not passed the order "mechanically".
 A single  bench of Justice SK Shinde held that ordinarily the Sanctioning Authority is the best person to judge, based on the investigation report placed before him, whether the government employee should or should not be prosecuted under the PC Act. A pre-requisite to provide a safe-guard to a public servant against frivolous and vexatious litigants.
 "Indisputably, application of mind on the part of Sanctioning Authority is imperative and therefore, order granting sanction must be demonstrative of the fact that there had been proper application of mind on the part of Sanctioning Authority", the bench observed.
 Justice Shinde cited the Supreme Court's judgement in the case of Ashok Tshering Bhutia v. State of Sikkim, which states that there should not be a hyper technical approach to test a sanction's validity, unless it results in failure of justice.
 The Court was examining Section 19(3) in The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, which reads.
 (3) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),—
 (a) no finding, sentence or order passed by a special Judge shall be reversed or altered by a court in appeal, confirmation or revision on the ground of the absence of, or any error, omission or irregularity in, the sanction required under sub-section (1), unless in the opinion of that court, a failure of justice has in fact been occasioned thereby. 
 Justice Shinde made the observations while acquitting a senior clerk, from the Town Planning Authority, in Pune, Maharashtra, convicted for accepting a bribe of Rs. 1500. The clerk who was convicted and sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment, in 2004, was allegedly caught red handed soon after he accepted the money from an ex-employee to submit her salary bills to the treasury.
 The clerk, Anand Salvi, appealed to the High Court against his conviction on the grounds that the sanction to prosecute him signed by the Director of Town Planning, Maharashtra State, was invalid. He relied heavily on the Director's testimony during the proceedings.
 The prosecution on the other hand said that there was no failure of justice, and therefore the sanction to prosecute was a valid sanction. 
 Justice SK Shinde observed that in Salvi's case, Sanctioning Authority plainly and simply put its signature on the draft sanction order by bringing out clerical mistakes. The Director's cross-examination showed he did not even remember or re-collect whether he had perused the investigation papers. 
 "It appears and in this fact situation and in consideration of the evidence, I do not hesitate to hold and conclude that the irregularity attached to the Sanction Order was not 'mere' irregularity but 'gross' in nature and failure of justice has been occasioned thereby," the court observed. 
 The court held that the Director's testimony and Sanctioning order revealed that on May 9, 2001, Superintendent of Police, Anti-Corruption Bureau, Pune sent the proposal to prosecute Salvi. The Director, who considered the proposal only on May 30, 2001, admitted that the draft sanction order was prepared and drafted by two other officers, independently, without his instructions. Moreover, the Director didn't remember if he had a chance to peruse the investigation papers.
 The court noted that only a few grammatical changes were made. The judge compared the draft sanction order with the final one to note that the latter was merely a copy. 
 "Thus, upon reading the testimony of the Sanctioning Authority along with the draft Sanction and Final Sanction Order, I hold, the Sanctioning Authority did not independently apply its mind while according the sanction," the court noted.

The Bombay High Court has held that writ petitions filed by employees against Air India Limited (AIL) are no longer maintainable due to subsequent privatisation of AIL even though they were maintainable at the inception of the case."The writ petitions, although maintainable on the dates they were instituted, have ceased to be maintainable by reason of privatization of AIL which takes it...
The Bombay High Court has held that writ petitions filed by employees against Air India Limited (AIL) are no longer maintainable due to subsequent privatisation of AIL even though they were maintainable at the inception of the case.
"The writ petitions, although maintainable on the dates they were instituted, have ceased to be maintainable by reason of privatization of AIL which takes it beyond our jurisdiction to issue a writ or order or direction to it", the court held.
Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice M. S. Karnik passed the judgment on September 20 in a batch of writ petitions filed by now retired AIL employees against AIL and the Union of India. The dispute in the petitions related to wages or promotion of the employees. All petitions alleged violation of Articles 14, 16, and 21 of the Constitution.
The question of maintainability didn't arise at the time of institution of the suits. However, AIL was privatized during the pendency of the matter raising to objection to its maintainability under Article 226 of the Constitution.
"With its privatization, AIL has ceased to be an Article 12 authority. There is and can be no doubt that no writ or order or direction can be issued on these writ petitions against AIL for an alleged breach of a Fundamental Right," said the court.
The question before the court was –
"Whether it is an invariable rule that a writ petition has to be decided on the basis of the facts as they were on the date of its institution or whether intervening/subsequent event(s), having a fundamental impact on exercise of jurisdiction for granting relief by this Court, may render the writ petition non-maintainable?"
Senior Advocate Sanjay Singhvi for the petitioners urged that the question of maintainability of the writ petitions must be decided with reference to facts as they existed on the date the case was filed. In the interest of justice and equity, the subsequent privatization of AIL should not render the writ petitions non-maintainable, it was contended
"The present writ petitions are maintainable since they pertain to the discharge of "public duties" by the respondents," argued Singhvi.
The petitioners also argued that the nature of their employment always. Singhvi also alleged collusion between AIL and Centre to defeat the rights of the petitioners as they were being kept in the dark about who has taken over the liabilities arising out of the present writ petitions.
Senior Advocate Darius Khambatta for AIL said the question of jurisdiction under Article 226 must be decided considering events subsequent to the filing of a writ petition up to the stage of issuance of a writ. He cited a number of judgments in which courts accepted that a writ petition is no longer maintainable if the government company is privatised during the pendency of the case. 
The court in the ruling said that the that the issue of maintainability of the writ petitions owing to the privatization of AIL during the pendency of the case, is no longer res integra. It relied on various High Court judgments which have been upheld by the Apex Court and said, "with to the privatization of AIL our jurisdiction to issue a writ to AIL, particularly in its role as an employer, does not subsist".
The change in the status of the 'authority' against whom the writ was initially claimed plays a significant role in determining the issue of maintainability," said the court. 
The court also noted that howsoever wide and expansive the jurisdiction might be "to reach injustice wherever found", such jurisdiction has to be exercised within well-defined self-imposed restrictions and limitations of jurisdiction as carved out by judicial pronouncements.
"We say that whether or not AIL was discharging public functions or the petitioners were in public employment need not be examined in these proceedings because, as the matter presently stands, no writ can be issued by us to AIL," said the court further.
The bench also noted that the long years of pendency of the case was bound to have shattered the hopes and aspirations of the retired employees. "However, at the same time, such inability to decide these writ petitions prior to privatization of AIL was due to reasons absolutely beyond the control of this Court, as admitted by Mr. Singhvi even. Notwithstanding the same, this Court, through its Chief Justice, regrets its inability to so decide prior to privatization of AIL," it said.
However, while disposing of the petitioners, the court said time of the pendency of the case be not counted for calculating limitation period in case the petitioners wish to pursue any other remedy in accordance with the law.

Dispute of a civil nature has been given colour of criminal offence, the Supreme Court observed in a judgment delivered last month while it quashed criminal proceedings initiated against a property purchaser.
The bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and JK Maheshwari observed that while considering a petition seeking quashing of criminal proceedings, the High Court should examine whether a complaint discloses criminal offence or not depends on the nature of the allegation and whether the essential ingredients of a criminal offence are present or not.
 Section 482 is designed to achieve the purpose of ensuring that criminal proceedings are not permitted to generate into weapons of harassment, the court reiterated.
In this case, an FIR was lodged against the power of attorney of the complainant and the purchaser of the property. Examining the FIR, the court observed that the criminal proceedings are being taken recourse to as a weapon of harassment against the purchaser. "The FIR does not disclose any offence so far as the Appellant is concerned. There is no whisper of how and in what manner, this Appellant is involved in any criminal offence and the charge sheet, the relevant part whereof has been extracted above, is absolutely vague", the court observed.
The court further observed that the charge sheet is totally vague. While allowing the appeal and, the bench observed thus:
There can be no doubt that jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. should be used sparingly for the purpose of preventing abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. Whether a complaint discloses criminal offence or not depends on the nature of the allegation and whether the essential ingredients of a criminal offence are present or not has to be judged by the High Court. There can be no doubt that a complaint disclosing civil transactions may also have 18 a criminal texture. The High Court has, however, to see whether the dispute of a civil nature has been given colour of criminal offence. In such a situation, the High Court should not hesitate to quash the criminal proceedings as held by this Court in Paramjeet Batra (supra) extracted above. 34. The given set of facts may make out a civil wrong as also a criminal offence. Only because a civil remedy is available may not be a ground to quash criminal proceedings. But as observed above, in this case, no criminal offence has been made out in the FIR read with the Charge-Sheet so far as this Appellant is concerned. The other accused Rajan Kumar has died.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that even if prima facie case is established against an accused, the approach of the court in granting bail should be that the accused should not be detained by way of punishment as pre-trial punishment as the same clearly falls foul of the principles of criminal jurisprudence.
 A bench comprising Justice Mohan Lal was hearing a plea seeking indulgence of the Court for grant of bail in an FIR registered with Police Station CBI, ACB, Jammu for commission of offences under section 7 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 r/w 120-B IPC. 
 Counsel for the Petitioner vehemently argued, that the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence is that the presumption of innocence always lies in favour of the accused until proved and found guilty, and keeping the petitioner/accused in judicial custody in further incarceration will amount to inflicting pre-trial punishment which is against the principle of criminal jurisprudence. 
 The petitioner further contended that the personal liberty as enshrined in the Constitution of India is of paramount importance which should not be deprived, petitioner/accused cannot be kept in detention for an indefinite period only upon the belief/mere apprehension that he will tamper with the prosecution evidence which cannot be expected as all the witnesses of the case are the officials of the CBI Department and none can expect that they will be influenced by petitioner/accused. 
 Contesting the bail application the respondent CBI argued that the words "reasonable grounds for believing" used by the Legislature for the purpose of granting bail means, that the Court while dealing with the grant of bail can only satisfy itself as to whether there is a genuine case against the accused and moreover due to involvement of government officials in accepting the illegal gratification/bribe the confidence of common person gets shaken. 
 Perusal of the record revealed that case FIR registered with Police Station CBI, ACB, Jammu for commission of offences under section 7 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 r/w 120-B IPC against petitioner/accused on the basis of complaint for demand of bribe of Rs. 12,000/-. Record further revealed that on receipt of the complaint the verification thereof was carried out by Sh. Sanjay Kumar SI wherein the demand of bribe by Davinder Sharma, Plant Protection Officer, Jammu from the complainant was confirmed, pursuant to which a trap was laid and the accused person namely Davinder Sharma was caught red-handed while accepting bribe of Rs. 12,000/- from the complainant and thereafter the said accused person was arrested on 11.05.2022. 
 The moot question before the court for determination was that even when there is a prima-facie case against the accused, what should be the approach of court in the matter of grant or refusal of bail
 Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Mohan Lal observed that from the allegations set out in the FIR, it clearly transpires, that there is a prima-facie case against the petitioner/accused. Elaborating on the legal position on the matter the bench observed legal provisions vis-à-vis bail abundantly clear, that the principle rule to guide release on bail is, ―to secure the presence of accused during trial, the object of bail is neither punitive nor preventative, deprivation of liberty must be considered a punishment, the courts owe more than verbal respect to the principle that punishment begins after conviction and that every man is deemed to be innocent until duly tried and duly found guilty. 
 Deliberating on the matter the court found it worthwhile to record the observations of supreme court in Sanjay Chandra versus Central Bureau of Investigation (2012) wherein SC while enlarging the accused in 2G spectrum case observed 
 "Deprivation of liberty must be considered a punishment, unless it can be required to ensure that an accused person will stand his trial when called upon. The courts owe more than verbal respect to the principle that punishment begins after conviction, and that every man is deemed to be innocent until duly tried and duly found guilty"
 Dealing with the contention of bail in offences under Prevention of Corruption Act the bench took support from the observations of the High Court of J&K&L in Mohd. Razak & Anr Vs State of J&K & Anr 2007 wherein High Court while dealing with a similar situation observed. 
 "Prevention of Corruption Act, 2006, cannot, in my opinion, be treated differently to deny them consideration for bail during investigation and trial merely because they were alleged to be involved for infraction of offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2006 and general principles governing grant or refusal of bail and provision of Section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure are undoubtedly required to be kept in view". 
 Examining the matter further the bench also placed its reliance on J&K&L High Court's judgment in Jagdish Kumar & Ors. Versus State and Ors 2010 wherein High Court observed 
"Even where a primafacie case is established, the approach of the court in the matter of bail, is not that the accused should be detained by way of punishment but whether the presence of the accused would be readily available for trial or that he is likely to abuse the discretion granted in his favour by tempering with the evidence"
 In view of the aforesaid discussion it is amply clear that there would be no danger of the course of justice being thwarted, concluded the bench while allowing the bail application.

The Supreme Court has observed that a party cannot take benefit of an inadvertent mistake committed by a court while passing an order.
A bench comprising Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna was hearing an appeal seeking enhancement of compensation for lands acquired by the NOIDA authority pursuant to a notification issued in 1976. 
The appellants had placed reliance on a 2014 judgment of the Allahabad High Court in the case Mangu v State of UP. In the said case, the High Court had passed a common judgment to dispose of a batch of appeals, which were predominantly relating to land acquisitions which took place in 1992. However, one of the appeals related to an acquisition of 1977, which got 'inadvertently' tagged with the other appeals relating to the 1992 acquisitions. As the High Court had passed a common order for enhancement, the land value of the 1977 acquisition also got 'mechanically' enhanced, along with the 1992 acquisitions. 
Before the Supreme Court, the appellants placed reliance on this enhancement granted by the High Court for the 1977 case
However, the Supreme Court noted that the case pertaining to the 1977 acquisition got inadvertently tagged with the other batch of cases pertaining to 1992 acquisition. Nobody pointed out this fact to the High Court. Therefore, the High Court "mechanically" enhanced the compensation for all cases, without noticing the presence of the case relating to 1977 acquisition in the batch of appeals.
"...as such it was a mistake on the part of the High Court in not noticing the difference with regard to the acquisition of the years 1977 and 1991", the Supreme Court noted.
The Court said that the appellants cannot take advantage of the mistake on the part of the High Court.
"Nobody can be permitted to take the benefit of the mistake either of the Court or of any party, which mistake has occurred inadvertently and without noticing the peculiar facts. As such it was the duty of the Advocate for the claimants to point out the correct facts.", the Supreme Court held.
The Court further noted that the NOIDA authority has filed a review petition after noticing this mistake, and the said review petition is pending adjudication. In this backdrop, the Supreme Court refused to accept the appellants' arguments based on the HC judgment.
Value given for subsequent acquisition cannot be considered
The Supreme Court also observed that while determining the market value of land, the compensation awarded to another land which was acquired subsequently cannot be taken in to consideration.
"As per the settled proposition of law, the compensation determined for the lands acquired subsequently cannot be said to be comparable at all", the judgment authored by Justice Shah stated.
The appellants placed reliance on the compensation awarded to lands acquired in 1983 to argue that the market value for their lands were not properly determined. The bench rejected this argument noting that the compensation awarded for subsequent acquisition cannot be taken into account.
"As per the settled preposition of law, the compensation determined for the lands acquired subsequently cannot be said to be comparable at all. Even otherwise in the facts and circumstances, the same cannot be said to be comparable because of the fact that it has come on record that in the year 1976 when the lands in question were acquired, there was no development at all, however, subsequently, after 1980 the development had taken place and even the development plan has been sanctioned at the time when the land was acquired in the year 1983, therefore, the aforesaid request cannot be accepted", 
the Court observed.
Case Title : Ajai Pal Singh and others versus State of Uttar Pradesh and others
Coram : Justice MR Shah & Justice AS Bopanna

The Karnataka High Court has observed that the decision of the suitability of partners to a marital tie rests exclusively with the individuals themselves. Neither the State nor the Society can intrude into that domain.
 A division bench of Justice B Veerappa and Justice K.S. HEMALEKHA while dismissing a habeas corpus petition filed by the father of a 19-year-old girl, who is said to have eloped and married without informing the parents, said, 
"The Courts, as upholders of Constitutional freedom, must safeguard their freedom. Courts are duty bound not to swerve the path of upholding our pluralism and diversity as a Nation.'
 It added, "Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, this Court deems fit proper to allow the daughter of the petitioner, to live with the 2nd respondent. Since this Court is convinced that the daughter of the petitioner is not in illegal detention of anybody, the present writ petition (HC) is liable to be dismissed." 
 However, on going through the facts of the case and inquiring with the daughter and her husband who were produced in court, the bench observed "It is also relevant to state that the parents also should understand that their children are the supreme asset of the nation. A proper education encompassing skill development, recreation and cultural activity has a positive impact on the child." 
 Further it said,
"Our history reveals that there are parents who sacrificed their lives to the children and the children who sacrificed their life to the parents. It is only a mutual love and affection between the two i.e., parents and children. If there is love and affection between two, there cannot be any rift in the family and there would be no question of either children going against the parents or parents going against the children to the Court to protect their rights. The parents should create a good atmosphere in the family by their love and affection to regain the confidence of the children. The children should also understand the fact that without their parents, they would not have been on the earth and would not have enjoyed the educational prospects including job, wealth and other luxuries and it is only the parents' contribution." 
 Rebuking the girl for eloping without informing her parents, the bench said, "She is at liberty to decide her future and choose her partner and at the same time, she should not be the reason for pain and agony suffered by her parents. Instead of eloping with respondent No.2, in all fairness she should have thought of her studies and informed the parents about her love with respondent No.2 and ought to have tried to convince her parents with regard to her marriage with respondent No.2." 
 Then it went on to opine, "The peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case clearly depicts that love is blind and more powerful weapon than the love and affection of the parents, family members and the society at large."
 The bench, being in disagreement with the steps taken by the girl, said "It is high time for the children to know that the life consists of reaction, resound and reflection. What they are doing to their parents today, would get back exactly tomorrow. What is the use of their education, power-position and wealth, when it does not help them to change their destiny. When the bad thoughts enter their mind; their education, intelligence, power and wealth become futile and meaningless."
 It added, "There is no greater God than parents. There is no greater Dharma than compassion, there is no enemy greater than anger, there is no wealth greater than good reputation, bad reputation is death itself. Even according to Manusmruthi, no person can repay his parents even in 100 years for all the troubles that they go through to give birth to him/her and raise him/her to adulthood. Therefore, always try to do whatever pleases your parents and your teacher, because only then does any religious worship done by you will bear some fruit." 
 Nonetheless, noting that the right to marry a person is one's choice is integral part of Article 21 of the Constitution, the bench said, "Matters of dress and of food, of ideas and ideologies, of love and partnership are within the central aspects of identity. The law may regulate (subject to constitutional compliance) the conditions of a valid marriage, as it may regulate the situations in which a marital tie can be ended or annulled. These remedies are available to parties to a marriage for it is they who decide best on whether they should accept each other into a marital tie or continue in that relationship. Society has no role to play in determining their choice of partners including the parents." 
 Finally, directing the parents or their family shall not interfere in their daughter's life, the bench expressed, "The love should be from "heart to heart and not mere external attraction." It is nature's decision and not anybody's and the parents should accept the nature's decision and should not go against nature." 
 It also directed the couple to get their marriage registered before the concerned sub-registrar's office within one month.

The Gujarat High Court has allowed a writ seeking a direction upon the Registrar of Marriages to consider the petitioners' application for issuance of a fresh marriage certificate, mentioning the date on which a pompous wedding was held with 'saptapadi', rather than a former date on which the couple had exchanged varmala in presence of a small gathering.
Due to pandemic of COVID-19 and the restrictions imposed by the Government on public gathering, the writ applicants entered into marriage with a very small number of relatives attending the marriage. The marriage invitation was not prepared and the couple only performed the ceremonies of exchanging garlands, tying mangalsutra and applying sindhoor. However, the ceremony of "datta homa" and "Saptapadi" (i.e. taking seven steps around the sacred fire) were not performed. 
Subsequently, on 19.12.2021, a pompous wedding was organized whereat the ceremonies of "datta homa" and "saptapadi" were performed.
Thus, the couple had sought change in the marriage certificate from 17.07.2021 to 19.12.2021.
The Applicant placed reliance on the decision of the Co-ordinate Bench of the High Court with similar facts and circumstances wherein the High Court had noted the problems the applicant was facing in cohabiting with her husband in Germany and permission was granted to the couple to make a fresh application for change in date.
Meanwhile, the Respondent authorities assured that if the applicant sought a change in the date in the marriage certificate, the authority would decide the same within four weeks.
 Accordingly, the Bench, felt inclined to exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction under Art 226 by directing the authorities to effect change in the marriage dates from 17.07.2021 to 19.12.2021. Consequently, the earlier marriage certificate ought to be quashed and set aside, per the Bench.

The Tripura High Court has made it clear that Section 63 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 does not bar the owner of a vehicle seized in raid to make an application seeking interim custody/ bail of his vehicle after expiry of thirty days from the date of seizure.
Justice Arindam Lodh observed:
 "The proviso of sub-section (2) of Section 63 of the NDPS Act is relevant to decide the issue raised by learned counsels appearing for the parties. A bare reading of the said proviso makes it aptly clear that an order of confiscation of an article or thing shall be made after expiry of one month from the date of seizure. In other words, an order of confiscation of any article or thing cannot be made by the court within one month from the date of seizure i.e. the court may pass an order of confiscation after expiry of one month. In the opinion of this court, the said proviso of sub-section (2) of Section 63 of the NDPS Act does not contemplate that the owner of the said vehicle cannot file an application for releasing his/her vehicle after expiry of one month."
 The Special Court had cited the case of Kishan Singh Vrs. State of Tripura to refuse interim custody of vehicle to the Petitioner herein. In the said case, it was held that there is a right to the owner who claimed "within 30 days" from the day of seizure, his title over the vehicle to have interim custody of the said vehicle subject to the adequate security till completion of the trial.
The High Court noted that the Special Court had misconstrued the aforesaid precedent. It noted,
"What the court has meant to say, that, in case no owner comes forward to claim the ownership of the vehicle within 30 days, then, the court may pass an order directing the Drug Disposal Committee for disposal of the vehicle by sale. In no way it bars the owner to approach the court and file an application for releasing the vehicle after expiry of 30 days."
It held that owner of the vehicle may file an application for bail at any stage of the proceeding or even during the proceeding of confiscation. "Needless to say, to claim the release of vehicle under seizure, the owner of the vehicle must satisfy the necessary conditions as laid down in sub Section (3) of Section 60 of the NDPS Act," Court added.
The police had detained and seized Petitioner's TATA Ultra 1518 Truck and recovered huge quantity of contraband articles. Driver of the vehicle was arrested. A case was registered under Section 20(b)(ii)(c)/25 and 29 of the NDPS Act. 
The owner of the vehicle filed an application before the Special Judge for releasing the vehicle on bail, but, after expiry of one month. Petitioner argued that Section 63 of the NDPS Act does not contemplate that an owner has to file an application for releasing his vehicle within a period of 30 days from the date of seizure.
 The High Court was of view that till today no confiscation proceeding has been initiated, even after expiry of one month from the date of seizure. It held that law does not mandate that a court must make an order of confiscation after expiry of one month from the date of seizure. The law makers have used the word "may" in sub section (2) of Section 63 of the NDPS Act which means that court is not legally bound to pass an order of confiscation in all the cases as a matter of routine.
Accordingly, the Court directed to release the petitioner's vehicle and quashed Special Judge's order, subject to furnishing a bail bond of Rs.ten lakh with two local sureties. The owner has been directed to keep the vehicle in good condition, to not transfer the vehicle, modify or change its nature and character till disposal of the case and to produce the vehicle as and when directed by the prosecution or by the court.
 Case Title : Shri Bal Krishna Mishra v The State of Tripura

On Wednesday, the Bombay High Court authoritatively ruled that a daughter could present a petition challenging the validity of her parent(s)' second marriage.

On Wednesday, the Bombay High Court authoritatively ruled that a daughter could present a petition challenging the validity of her parent(s)' second marriage.
 A Division Bench of Justices VG Bisht and RD Dhanuka interpreted clause (b) of the Explanation appended to Section 7 to hold that a daughter has every locus to bring in question the validity of her father's marriage.
 It was stated,
 "Having regard to the Objects and Reasons of the Act vis-a-vis literal construction of Clause (b) under Explanation, in our considered view, the appellant has every locus to bring in question the validity of marriage of her father with the respondent and as also respondent's status."
 The Bench pronounced judgment in an appeal against a Family Court's dismissal of a woman's petition (appellant) against her father's second wife. The appellant filed a petition questioning the validity of the respondent's marriage to the appellant's father. Her father, a wealthy industrialist, married the respondent after the death of the appellant's mother.
 The Family Court had rejected the petition stating that the appellant had filed suits against the respondent before the High Court at earlier instances. Applying Rule 2, Order II of the Civil Procedure Code, the Family Court opined that the appellant had relinquished her right to claim the relief of nullity of marriage as against the respondent when she filed her suits in the High Court. Therefore, she could not claim the relief before the Family Court, it was ruled.
 Order II of Code of Civil Procedure 1908 "Suit to include the whole claim"Rule 2: Relinquishment of part of claim- Where a plaintiff omits to sue in respect of, or internationally relinquishes, any portion of his claim, he shall not afterwards sue in respect of the portion so omitted or relinquished.
 The appellant averred that the respondent married her father claiming to have divorced her first husband while in fact the divorce documents were doubtful.
 She additionally contended that the respondent took undue advantage of her father's mental ailments, infirmities and unsoundness of mind, married him, and then unduly influenced him with the motive of siphoning his properties. Her father passed away in 2015, the Court was informed.
 Opposing the petition as well as the grounds of appeal, the respondent asserted that the appellant did not possess the required legal standing (locus standi) to assail her father's marriage. To buttress this submission, her counsel propounded that the Family Courts Act allowed only parties to a marriage to assail the validity of marriage.
 After an analysis of Section 7 of the legislation and its attendant explanation clauses, the Court took specific notice to clause b.
 Whereas Clause (a) expressly specified the Family Court's jurisdiction to encompass suits between parties to a marriage in respect of nullity of marriage, restitution of conjugal rights etc, Clause (b) made no such stipulation.
 The explanation, along with clauses (a) and (b), reads as below:
 Explanation: The suits and proceedings referred to in this sub-section are suits and proceedings of the following nature, namely:— (a) a suit or proceeding between the parties to a marriage for a decree of nullity of marriage (declaring the marriage to be null and void or, as the case may be, annulling the marriage) or restitution of conjugal rights or judicial separation or dissolution of marriage; (b) a suit or proceeding for a declaration as to the validity of a marriage or as to the matrimonial status of any person;
 In this context, the Court remarked,
 "To note that Clause (b) is widely couched to encompass in its ambit and include the proceeding of the nature referred to regarding declaration of the validity of the marriage or it could be for a declaration of the matrimonial status of any person, would be a but fair comment."
 After a discussion of the Statute's Objects and Reasons, the Court declared that as per a literal construction of Clause(b) the appellant possessed the necessary locus to move the petition.
 As to the question of jurisdiction, the Court found that the Family Court had erred in applying Order II, Rule 2 to the case at hand. 
 Referring to the statute, the Court asserted that a Family Court was intended to possess exclusive jurisdiction of matters connected to matrimonial relief. Stating that Section 8 of the Family Courts Act denuded the High Court of its authority to grant reliefs relating to marriage etc, the Court opined that the question of Order II, Rule 2's applicability did not arise even remotely. This was especially as the previous suits were filed before the appellant discovered the alleged irregularities in the respondent's divorce documents
 The Court said,
 "In our view, since in view of Explanation (b) to Section 7(1) of the Act, the reliefs sought in the proceedings filed before the Family Court could not have been granted by the Civil Court in the suits filed by the appellant, question of applicability of Order 2 Rule 2 did not arise even remotely."
 With these observations, among others, the Court remanded the matter back to the Family Court for a fresh decision on the validity of marriage. Expressing that the matter was to be decided expeditiously, preferably within six months, the appeal was allowed.

The Orissa High Court has set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on a rape accused on the ground that the State Defence Counsel, who represented him in the Trial Court, was neither supplied with police papers nor given a reasonable amount of time to prepare for the cross-examination of the victim.
Expressing dissatisfaction over the hurried-up manner in which the cross-examination was completed, the Single Judge Bench of Justice Sangam Kumar Sahoo observed,
“Engaging a new State Defence Counsel without providing him police papers and just asking him to inspect the case record and to cross-examine the victim and also taking consent from him to conclude the cross-examination on that day itself, in my humble view, is a gross illegality and the accused has been seriously prejudiced by such action of the trial Court. A criminal trial is not an IPL T20 match where every ‘substitute player’ can be an ‘impact player’.”
The appellant faced trial in the Court of 3rd Additional Sessions Judge, Balasore for offence punishable under Section 376(2)(l) of the IPC on the accusation that he being a relative of the son-in-law of the informant committed rape on the victim, the disabled daughter of the informant.
The Trial Court found the appellant guilty under section 376(2)(l) of the IPC and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of ten years and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- and in default, to undergo R.I. for a further period of one year. Being aggrieved by the said decision, the appellant approached the High Court filing this appeal.
It was contended for the appellant that he has been seriously prejudiced as a new State Defence Counsel (SDC) was engaged by the Trial Court on the date of examination of the victim and no police paper was supplied to him. Further, the Trial Court asked the SDC to go through the case record and complete the cross-examination of the victim on that very day itself.
It was submitted that the SDC did not get a reasonable opportunity to read the case records deeply, to prepare the case thoroughly, to have an interaction with the appellant for such preparation for which he put a few questions to the victim in the cross-examination and closed it on account of pressure from the Trial Court. Thus, it was prayed to the Court to set aside the conviction and remand back the matter for fresh trial.
Court’s Observations
The Court deemed it proper to go through the order-sheets of the Trial Court, where it found that the Addl. Public Prosecutor filed a petition on 11.04.19 to appoint the father of the disabled victim girl as the interpreter to decode the evidence likely to be given by her and a copy of the petition was handed over to the SDC. 
However, the SDC was granted only 50 minutes to file objection to such petition and when he sought for more time to file objection, the Trial Court rejected the same mainly on the ground the victim girl had come to the Court several times. 
Then the SDC left the Court room and did not appear for the recording of the evidence of the victim. Since he did not turn up, another counsel, whose name found place in the list of State Defence Counsel, was appointed and he was directed to inspect the case records immediately. 
After inspecting the record, he got ready to cross-examine the victim and gave his consent to complete the cross-examination of the victim on that day and accordingly, the evidence of victim girl was recorded taking the assistance of her father as interpreter and she was discharged.
After perusing the order sheet of the Trial Court, the Court was of the opinion that the concerned Judge had made up his mind to complete the recording of the evidence of the victim on that day itself. Though it was observed in the order-sheet that the victim had come to the Court several times, but the Court did not find mentioning of the same in the order-sheets of the previous dates.
Thus, Justice Sahoo expressed serious displeasure over the manner in which the cross-examination was conducted and completed on that day and said,
“The engagement of State defence counsel in the trial Court should not be a mere compliance of provisions of law or an empty formality. It must not be a sham or an eye-wash but with all intent, purpose and sincerity, the lawyer must conduct the case of the accused.” 
He said our constitutional system demands that a person not only be given an opportunity of being heard before being condemned, but also that such opportunity be fair, just and reasonable.
“If the conducting counsel engaged for an accused appears to be superfluous and there is real contest, right to fair trial would be denied. It is the duty of the Court while appointing the State defence counsel to supply him all relevant papers and to give sufficient time to him for preparing the defence, otherwise such defence would only be a farce without its real purpose,” he added.
The Court also cited the guidelines issued by the Apex Court in Anokhilal v. State of Madhya Pradesh, for proper representation of accused persons in Courts having regard for Articles 39-A and 21 of the Constitution.
Emphasising the words used in Section 304(1), CrPC, i.e. "...the accused is not represented by a pleader”, the Court said it do not and cannot mean a kind of paper and sham representation as distinguished from a substantial, bona fide and diligent representation. 
“Not ensuring the reasonable and diligent representation by counsel or pleader to the accused would not relieve the State of its obligation under section 304(1) Cr.P.C. and could not pass the test of fairness which every action of the State must withstand in keeping with the obligation under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution”, it added.
Accordingly, the Court was of the view that proper opportunity was not granted to the SDC to prepare the case thoroughly and to cross-examine the victim. 
Consequently, the impugned order of conviction of the appellant under Section 376(2)(l) of IPC was set aside, remanding it back to the Trial Court for fresh trial from the stage of cross-examination.

Madras High Court has recently rejected the relief sought by a Club to forbear the insisting upon obtaining FL2 License for allowing its members to consume liquor (bought from government-approved shops) inside the Club premises.
 A single-judge bench of Justice S.M Subramaniam held that Clubs registered under Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act with its bye-laws also registered under the provisions of the Act must strictly follow the objects and purpose already set out in the bye laws. When alcohol consumption is beyond the scope of the bye-laws of the petitioner club, it must be r/w Rules relating to the grant of licenses in Chapter IV of The Tamil Nadu Liquor (License and Permit) Rules, 1981, which makes it abundantly clear that the Club cannot allow its members to consume alcohol in its premises without FL.2 License and an amendment to the existing bye-laws.
 F.L.2 license is stipulated for 'license for possession of liquor by a non-proprietary Club for supply to members' in the Rules. Even for consumption of liquor in a Club or Association, a license must be obtained for the possession of liquor and for supply to its members inside the premises, the court added.
 The single-judge bench accordingly noted in its order that the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act, 1937 imposes a total prohibition on buying and consumption of alcohol. However, this is subject to exceptions when r/w the Tamil Nadu Liquor Retail Vending (in Shops and Bars) Rules, 2003 (regulates the liquor retail vending both in shops and bars) and Tamil Nadu Liquor (License and Permit) Rules, 1981 (deals with grant of license and possession of liquor and licenses for liquor used for consumption).
 "…Thus the legal position is that the prohibition is the law and buying, selling, possession and consumption are regulated by the Rules in force. Therefore, consumption of liquor when regulated under the Rules, then the consumption must be in accordance with the provisions of the Act and Rules and it is not at the choice of the consumers of liquor. When there is total prohibition imposed under law, usage of liquor is regulated through Rules, then the Rules should be scrupulously implemented for the purpose of buying, selling, possession and consumption of liquor", the court noted while also adding that consumption of alcohol in the club premises without license will attract offences punishable under the Prohibition Act.
 The court has also censured the growing tend of filing writ petitions seeking general directions like injunctions, almost often on the pretext that law enforcement authorities are interfering with the lawful businesses of the complainants.
 "Conducting inspections on suspicious circumstances, on informations or complaints is the primary duty of the Public Authorities and Police Officials. Thus, they are bound to conduct such inspections, so as to prevent any illegal activities in any such Clubs, Associations, Spa, Massage Centre, Recreation Clubs etc. No doubt, largescale allegations against these Spa, Clubs, Associations, Recreation Clubs etc., are in the public domain and such allegations are resulting in various consequences in the Society", the bench further added.
 While declining the relief for an injunction, the court has also issued a few directions to the Director-General of Police, that includes constitution of trained Special Squads across the State of Tamil Nadu for the purpose of conducting inspections in Social Clubs, Associations, Spa, Recreation Clubs, Massage Centres etc., and initiating action against any offence or illegal activity.
 It has also been instructed that there must be communication about the action taken to competent jurisdictional authorities under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, enabling those Authorities to initiate further actions under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, 1975. DGP should also issue guidelines to subordinate officers to coordinate with the Registration Department and other Government Departments for effective implementation of statutory provisions
 The DGP has also been asked to issue circulars within four weeks to police officials, registration departments, local bodies, connected government departments etc to initiate action against erring clubs and associations.
 The matter has been posted for reporting compliance on 24th January, 2022.
 Arguments Raised And Other Observations Made
 The petitioner in the case was 'Kancheepuram Reading Room and Tennis Club' registered under Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, 1975. The petitioner club contended that the police officials were harassing its members with constant and unnecessary inspections. It was also submitted that purchasing liquor from Government approved shops, bringing the liquor bottle inside the petitioner-Club premises and consumption of liquor by the members in the Club premises, cannot be objected by the Police Authorities. It was also submitted that license is not required as long as the petitioner club is not selling alcohol in its premises.
 The government advocate for the respondent authorities argued that consumption of alcohol is not in consonance with the purpose and object for which Reading Room and Tennis Club was registered, i.e., permitting the sports activities and maintaining a reading room for its members. Another contention levelled by the respondent police was that the Club is a public place and liquor consumption in such a place is illegal in the absence of a valid license.
 Aligning with the submissions made by the Government Advocate, the court finally held that Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act bars manufacture of, traffic in, consumption of liquor and intoxicating drugs. Section 4-A makes it illegal to consume alcohol in public places without a valid license, which in turn, permits the authorities to prosecute such intoxicated persons. The court also added that Section 37 and Section 38 of the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act talks about the instances where a registered society's license can be revoked/ cancelled. Section 37 places an impediment on registered societies to act outside the scope of the bye-laws or objects specified in the memorandum filed with the Registrar under Section 6. Similarly, Section 38 terms unlawful activities as a ground sufficient to cancel the registration of the registered society. The process of cancellation under both sections would include an opportunity given to the registered society to show cause why the license shouldn't be cancelled.
Senior Counsel T.R. Rajagopalan appeared for the petitioner club. Additional Government Pleader M. Rajendiran appeared for the respondents.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has recently held that the seeker of condonation of delay is not required to explain the period of his absence during the trial, what is required is explanation for period of delay which runs as per the Limitation Act.
The observations were made by Justice Vinod Chatterji Koul while hearing a civil second appeal in terms of which the appellant had thrown a challenge to the judgment passed by District Judge, Kulgam in terms of which it had dismissed the application seeking condonation of a delay of 24 days. As a consequence, the appeal also got dismissed as the court below held it to be time barred.
The court after perusing the material on record, noted that First Appellate Court (District Judge, Kulgam) has taken into account the absence of appellant before the Trial court as according to First Appellate Court the appellant has not given sufficient reasons that prevented him to appear before Trial Court during pendency of the civil suit till it culminated in passing of ex parte decree.
In its bid to answer the question as to “whether the seeker of condonation of delay was required to explain the period of his absence during the trial of the suit”, Justice Koul observed that First Appellate Court should have been alive to the position that an application seeking condonation of delay is to be decided while taking liberal view subject to explanation given by appellant more particularly when even there is not any inordinate delay.
Elaborating further on the subject Justice Koul elucidated that the appellant was to explain the delay which occasioned in not filing the appeal within the limitation period after passing of the decree and judgment, further adding, 
 "However, the First Appellate court has passed order impugned rejecting the application by holding that no sufficient cause has been shown by the appellant for his absence before the Trial court for the period ex parte proceedings were initiated against him till passing of the judgment," 
Pointing out the perversity in the judgment of the First Appellate Court the bench further added that law provides that delay is to be explained for the period beyond the period of limitation prescribed and the limitation in this case would run from the date of passing of the decree and not from any date prior to passing of the same. 
The court also noted that the applicant-petitioner was therefore, was therefore required to explain what occasioned the delay after passing of the decree, which has been Sufficiently explained in the application supported by an affidavit.
The bench said that the First Appellate Court instead of limiting consideration to that period has gone beyond the provisions and has taken into account the period of absence before the Trial court.
"The seeker of condonation of delay is not required to explain the period of his absence during the trial, what is required is the period of delay which runs as per the Limitation Act.", Justice Koul concluded while allowing the petition.

Merely stating that two people belonging to the opposite gender share a close relationship, won't amount to defamation, the Allahabad High Court observed last week while quashing a summoning order in a defamation complaint case.
The Bench of Justice Saumitra Dayal Singh further observed that being close to someone in a natural or normal human relationship and forming an illicit relationship are two completely different things.
Facts of the case in brief 
It was submitted before the Court that the statements that form the subject matter of allegation of defamation, was recorded in the course of a criminal investigation, wherein, the applicant before the Court was listed as a prosecution witness against the complainant Naseem (the person who filed the defamation case).
Importantly, it was submitted that the applicant had only stated that the said Naseem had a close relationship with Sanyogita wife of Sompal and he had nowhere stated that Naseem had formed an illicit relationship with Sanyogita.
The applicant further contended that the statement made by the witness in the course of the investigation can never constitute the offence of defamation and since the criminal case was pending on the date of institution of the present defamation complaint, therefore, the allegation of defamation may not arise at such preliminary stage.
Therefore, the applicant moved to the High Court seeking quashing of summoning order issued in the 2007 defamation case. 
Court's observations
At the outset, the Court noted that the criminal case (wherein the alleged defamatory was made) was pending on the date of the complaint being lodged and for that reason, the application appeared to be premature.
Further, without expressing any definite opinion if the alleged defamatory statement would constitute the offence of defamation, as such statement was made during a lawful proceeding, the Court noted thus:
"...the copy of the statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. does appear to suggest that the applicant had only stated that the complainant Naseem had a close relationship with Sanyogita. In itself that may never be enough to constitute the offence of defamation."
Lastly, the Court noted that since it was not clear as to whether any further or other imputation relied upon in the complaint was actually made, as the complainant did not bring the material on record, the Court held that it would serve no useful purpose in allowing such a vague prosecution to continue, any further.
With this, the application was allowed and the summoning order was quashed.
Case title - Nakli Singh v. State of U.P. and Others
Read Order

The Supreme Court observed that any fault or shortcoming on the part of the staff of the Subordinate Court or any delay in compliance by the Court are not by itself a reason to transfer a case.
In this case, the Allahabad High Court transferred a criminal case from the Court of Additional Sessions Judge First, Aligarh to the corresponding Court at Mathura. This was because the High Court felt dissatisfied with the conduct of the staff of the Subordinate Court in not taking on record an order passed by it. Transfer petitions were filed by some accused persons who contended that the discharge application moved by some of the accused persons was not being decided and they were asked to appear before the Court at Aligarh on every date. The High Court even asked the Trial Judge to appear in-person and submit apology.
While considering the appeal filed against this order, the bench comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Aniruddha Bose observed: 
"In the totality of circumstances of the case, we do not wish to make any comments on the nature of proceedings this matter has undergone but, we are clearly of the view that because of any fault or shortcoming on the part of the staff of the Subordinate Court and for that matter, any delay in compliance by the Court were hardly the reasons for the High Court to immediately adopt the course of transferring the matter and that too, to a different station."
The court therefore set aside the High Court order and restored the case on the file of Aligarh court.

The Delhi High Court has observed that a minor child is entitled to claim maintenance for his upbringing by the father and that such a child is not bound by the divorce settlement regarding maintenance between his parents. 
Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh was dealing with an appeal filed by a minor child being aggrieved by the grant of interim maintenance by the Family Court at Rs. 15,000 per month. 
The High Court had vide order dated April 22, 2021 enhanced the said maintenance amount and directed the father to pay Rs. 25,000 per month to the minor, considering that his school fee itself was in that range.
Observing that when the mother of the minor child obtained divorce by mutual consent, the maintenance was fixed in respect of the child at Rs. 5,000 per month, the Court said:
"It goes without saying that the appellant being a minor, is not bound by that settlement, and he is entitled to claim maintenance for himself for his upbringing from the respondent i.e., his father."
The appellant had contended that the father had not truly and correctly disclosed his income and that from his Income Tax Returns (ITRs) filed before the Court, it appeared that apart from agricultural income which was the only income claimed to have been earned by the father, he had been deriving rental income from a property, which was separate from the agricultural income.
The counsel appearing for the minor child had vehemently challenged the averments made in the affidavit filed by the father thereby claiming that he had deliberately mis-stated facts before the Court.
"Considering the fact that the present appeal is directed against the fixation of the interim maintenance at the rate of Rs. 15,000/- per month, which we have raised to Rs. 25,000/- per month, and the appellant's petition is still pending consideration before the learned Family Court, we are inclined to relegate the parties to the learned Family Court to establish their respective claims/ defence before the learned Family Court, and to invite the final order from the learned Family Court," the Court said. 
The Court therefore disposed of the appeal with a direction to the respondent father to continue to pay Rs. 25,000 per month to the minor child till the disposal of the petition preferred by the child, or till further orders that the Family Court may pass. 
"The right of the appellant to seek further enhancement, even at the interim stage, is preserved. No adjournments shall be sought by the parties, nor should either of the parties be granted any undue adjournments by the learned Family Court, and we request the learned Family Court to dispose of the petition pending before it under Section 20 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 within the next one year," the Court added. 
The Court said that all rights and contentions of the parties, including those raised in the appeal, were preserved and shall be examined by the Family Court.
Title: FATEH SAHARAN v. ROHIT SAHARAN

The Kerala High Court on Tuesday established that clauses in a bye-law or an agreement that prohibit a person from keeping a pet in their residential premises shall be void and unenforceable in law.A Division Bench of Justice A.K.

The Kerala High Court on Tuesday established that clauses in a bye-law or an agreement that prohibit a person from keeping a pet in their residential premises shall be void and unenforceable in law.
A Division Bench of Justice A.K. Jayasankaran Nambiar and Justice Gopinath P. was adjudicating upon a Public Interest Litigation filed by a person aggrieved by the stand of the office bearers of the resident association of the apartment complex in which he resides.
It was alleged that, by taking shelter under a clause in the bye-laws of the association that prohibits the residents from keeping pets of their choice in their individual apartments, the office bearers of the association have issued notices to him asking him to remove his pet from the premises. 
The Court allowed the petition stating:
"We allow this writ petition by declaring that clauses in any bye-law or agreement, that have the effect of absolutely prohibiting a person from keeping a pet of his/her choice in a residential unit occupied by that person, should be treated as void and unenforceable in law. Consequently, resident owners' associations and resident welfare associations shall desist from putting up notice boards and signposts prohibiting the keeping or entry of pets in their respective premises."
During the pendency of the writ petition, other persons facing similar directives from the office bearers of their respective resident associations impleaded themselves as additional respondents in the matter. 
The bench further clarified that this declaration shall be seen as one operating in rem and this judgment as one covered by Section 41 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. It added:
"The Registry shall send a copy of this judgment to the Chief Secretary of the State who shall, in turn, take immediate steps to issue necessary instructions to the newly reconstituted State Animal Welfare Board, the administrative departments of the State, and to its law enforcement agencies so that complaints brought to their notice by the citizenry, as regards infringement of the rights declared in this judgment receive immediate attention and resolution."
The order also touches upon the right to life of animals as recognized by the Supreme Court in the case Animal Welfare Board of India v. A Nagaraja.
 Thereafter, the State Government was directed to take note of the suggestions put forth in the judgment to cultivate a healthy respect for animals among the people in the State.
It was also suggested that the Animal Welfare Board of India had issued certain guidelines on this subject through its letter dated 26.02.2015 and that these guidelines could be adopted by the resident associations while stipulating conditions for the keeping of pets in the apartments.
The Court also noted that over the years, the domain of animal welfare have received wider recognition and importance that it deserves:
"The trajectory of animal rights jurisprudence in India has sadly been a retrograde one. Over the years we have virtually moved from an eco-centric worldview where animals, like humans, were seen as living beings containing a life force and therefore morally worthy, to an anthropocentric one where humans alone are seen as morally worthy and privileged to enjoy the bounties that nature has to offer." 
On that note, the Court opined that the time has come to nudge the citizenry into respecting the claims of other living beings that too have rights in our shared ecosystem. It reiterated that compassion and empathy are the very essences of civilization and we must strive to preserve these values as part of our culture. 
"It is often an inadequate understanding of the subject that fuels one's intolerance to that 'other' and hence the State and its institutions of governance must take appropriate measures to inculcate a spirit of accommodation towards animals amongst our people, preferably by introducing animal awareness programmes at the school level in the State." 
Considering the above views, the Bench found it justifying to rule that any clauses in the resident association agreements attempting to prevent owners from keeping pets are illegal, unconstitutional and unenforceable in law:
"We have no hesitation, therefore, to hold that those clauses in the bye-laws of resident associations, that seek to prevent owners/occupiers of residential apartments from keeping pet animals of their choice in the residential apartments owned by them or accessing the elevators and common facilities in the apartment buildings, are illegal, unconstitutional and unenforceable in law. 
The Court added that Kerala of all the States, which calls itself God's own country, should not be denying privileges to animals.
"Our coastal State, which announces itself to be 'Gods Own Country' to the visitors who come calling to its shores, cannot be seen denying just privileges to its animal inhabitants."
While holding such clauses as illegal, unconstitutional and unenforceable, it was also emphasised that the aforesaid freedoms recognised in animals, and the co-relational right recognised in pet owners, are not absolute or unconditional and must be qualified by safeguards designed to protect the competing rights of others including the owners/residents of neighbouring apartments. 
Accordingly, the Court made it clear that, short of effectively prohibiting the keeping and maintaining of pets in the residential apartments and appurtenant premises, the resident associations may stipulate reasonable conditions that must be adhered to by the owners/residents of individual apartments while keeping pets therein.
The Court thereby allowed the petition and concluded its order appreciating the efforts of the counsels involved in the matter:
"Before parting, we wish to acknowledge the able assistance rendered by all counsel who appeared in this case as also the amicus curiae Sri.Keerthivas Giri. The enthusiasm shown by them in espousing the cause of animals has been truly encouraging. May their tribe increase."
Advocates K.S. Hariharaputhran, S.R. Prasanth, Bhanu Thilak and Sruthi K. appeared for the petitioner in the matter. 
Addl. Advocate General Asok M Cherian, Government Pleader Shyam Prasanth, CGC Jaishankar V Nair, Amicus Curiae Keerthivas Giri, Advocates Sayuja and K.R Rajeev Krishnan appeared for the respondents.

A Delhi Court has recently allowed recording of evidence through videoconferencing mode on a mutual application moved on behalf of the parties.
Stating that the aforesaid exercise will be done in accordance with the videoconferencing Rules framed by the Delhi High Court, Metropolitan Magistrate Devanshu Sajlan ordered thus:
"The present matter is a '5-year-old'matter. Both the parties have shown mutual willingness in recording of evidence through VC. Accordingly, the mutual oral application moved on behalf of the parties is allowed."
The Court has directed that an audio-visual recording of the examination of the complainant shall be preserved. Additionally, an encrypted master copy with hash value is also directed to be retained as a part of the record.
"The evidence shall be transcribed through the mode of 'screen sharing option' on Cisco Webex, so that both the parties and their counsels can follow/ read the transcription in real time," the Court has directed.
While observing that all endeavours shall be made to record evidence through VC, the Court has directed that in the event of disruption during the recording of evidence, the exercise may be adjourned if it appears that the witness or complainant is deliberately disconnecting his internet connection.
".. the court is cognizant of the fact that internet connectivity issues can be taken as an excuse for not answering questions put by the learned counsel to the witness and to indulge in witness prompting," the Court reasoned.
Other directions are as follows:
-Upon conclusion of the transcription of the cross-examination of the complainant, the complainant shall be provided with a soft copy of the transcript (bearing the digital signature of the undersigned court) through the official email-id of the court, and the complainant shall be required to affix his signature on the transcript after taking a print-out of the same.
-After affixing his signature on the printed copy of the transcript, the complainant shall be required to send a scanned copy of the same on the official email-id of the court. 
-Due to the present situation of COVID-19 pandemic, both the parties are in agreement that it is not advisable to depute a 'coordinator' at the place from where the complainant shall appear for recording of his evidence. 
-However, in order to prevent unnecessary tutoring or prompting, learned counsel for the complainant has submitted that he shall ensure that the complainant appears for recording of his evidence through VC from his home; and not from the office premises/ chamber of the learned counsel for the complainant. 
-The complainant shall not use mobile phone/ any communication device while his evidence is being recorded. 
-Further, the complainant shall ensure that he has a proper internet connection so that there are no disruptions while recording of his evidence.
The Delhi High Court as well as the District Courts have been hearing urgent matters via Videoconferencing mode in the wake of covid 19 pandemic.
Case Title: Kanwal Nain Singh Mokha v. Rekha Khurana

The Bombay High Court has directed the State Government to sympathetically and expeditiously consider the case of a young woman for appointment to a non-constabulary post in the police department, three years after a medical test declared her a "male."
 The woman had qualified with flying colours in 2018 from the Nashik Rural Police Recruitment drive from the Scheduled Caste category but based on her medical test, her marks didn't make the cut off for the men's category.
 "It is an extremely unfortunate case. The petitioner comes from a poor economic strata of the Society; her parents are doing sugarcane cutting work; the petitioner is the eldest in the family… It appears that right from the beginning, the petitioner was not aware that she was any different…No fault can be found in the petitioner, as, throughout, she has pursued her career as a female. Infact, according to the petitioner, she has all female attributes," the court said in the order. 
 A division bench of Justice Revati Mohite Dere and Justice Madhav Jamdar passed the order after the Advocate General's assurance that the case would be considered on priority and all benefits of a normally appointed employee would be made available to her. 
 Observing that the "wait has already been too long" the court asked the State to decide within 4 weeks of receiving the assured recommendation from the police department for her appointment. 
 The woman was 19 when she applied to the police department. She scored 171 out of 200 marks in her written and physical tests and. However, when she was sent for a mandatory medical examination to JJ Hospital, a sonography revealed "her uterus and ovaries were absent and a prostate-like structure was seen at the base of her bladder". 
 Another karyotyping test at the National Institute of Immuno-haematology (KEM Hospital) showed she has both "XY" (male and female) chromosomes. They opined she was a male. 
 Anyhow, with the SC category cut off for men being 181 of 200, she was ineligible. She was informed about this thought an RTI. 
 She then approached the Bombay High Court through advocate Vijay Kumar Garad. He argued that his client was qualified for the job and couldn't be denied a job merely because of a karyotyping test, especially when the results were not made available to her. 
 The Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni took up the matter with the State Government to consider the petitioner's as a special case. He said that the Special Inspector General will make a recommendation to the Home Department for her appointment to a non-constabulary post. 
 The petitioner would be treated at par with other normally recruited employees and would be entitled for all the benefits, including promotions, etc.
 "We appreciate the sensitivity and alacrity shown by the learned Advocate General and the State Authorities," the bench said while disposing of the petition. 
 Case Title: ABC Versus The State of Maharashtra and Anr.

The Karnataka High Court has reiterated that a land can either be a "forest" or a "forest land", but there cannot be any "deemed forest" in absence of any provision under the Forest Conservation Act.
 A division bench Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Ashok S Kinagi while allowing a petition filed by one DM Deve Gowda said, 
"This Court, vide judgment and order dated 12.06.2019 passed in W.P.No.54476/2016 (GM-MM-S) C/w W.P.No.51135/2016 (Dhananjay vs. State of Karnataka and others), has categorically held that there is no concept of "deemed forest"".
The Court was of the view that the land can either be a "forest" or a "forest land", but there cannot be any "deemed forest" in absence of any provision under the Act.
 The petitioner had approached the court seeking to quash the order and endorsement issued by the Deputy Conservator of Forest (Chikkamagaluru division). Further it was sought to issue directions to the respondent to permit him to do stone quarrying in his land and to issue a quarrying licence.
 The bench noted that there is consensus between the counsel for the petitioner and the Additional Government Advocate appearing for the respondents that the case of Dhananjay (supra) squarely covers the controversy involved in the present writ petition.
 Following which the bench said, "In this view of the matter, we deem it appropriate to allow this writ petition without calling for any statement of objections from the respondents as the judgment passed by this Court in the case of Dhananjay (supra) holds good."
 The court while quashing the orders passed by the authority, directed the respondents to consider the application made by the petitioner for grant of the quarrying licence/lease or the renewal thereof, within two months, in light of Dhananjay (supra).
 The bench clarified that, "While considering the applications afresh, the concerned authority will have to consider whether the subject lands are "forest" or "forest land" as laid down in the decision of the Apex Court in T N GODAVARMAN vs Union of India and others, (1997), 2 SCC 267."
 It added, "If the authority concerned finds that the land is a "forest" or a "forest land", lease or extension of lease cannot be granted unless the consent of the Central Government is obtained as per section 2 of the Forest Act."

The Allahabad High Court last week directed the Uttar Pradesh Government and all its concerned authorities/committees to implement the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018 forthwith.
This direction came from the Bench of Justice Surya Prakash Kesarwani and Justice Vikas Budhwar that was hearing the plea of a petitioner, Mithlesh Narayan Tiwari, who is a witness in a 2018 Murder case, and his application for protection was rejected twice by the District Level Committee/Superintendent of Police, Prayagraj.
However, after High Court's October 05, 2021 order, the respondents started giving protection to the petitioner on dates fixed in the trial which shall continue till the conclusion of the trial. 
The Chief Standing Counsel also submitted that protection has been provided to the petitioner by order dated October 13, 2021, and he further informed the Court that the State Government had taken a decision to implement the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018 and has taken several steps and it is being fully implemented.
Against this backdrop, the Court, at the outset, referred to the Apex Court's ruling in the case of Mahender Chawla and Others Vs. Union of India and Others (2019) 14 SCC 615, wherein the Supreme Court, in December 2018, approved the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018, prepared by the Union of India and had directed it and all states and union territories to enforce the same in letter and spirit.

Further, the Court persued the affidavit filed by the Secretary (Home) stating therein that Standing Committee consisting of District and Sessions Judge (Chairman), District Magistrate (Member Secretary) and Senior Superintendent of Police/Superintendent of Police (Member) had been constituted in each district of Uttar Pradesh. 
However, the Court noted that merely letters have been issued by the State Government, but the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018 was not being implemented in letter and spirit.
"It is only after the present writ petition was filed and an order dated 05.10.2021 was passed, only then the State respondents have given protection to the petitioner by passing the order dated 30.10.2021. This instance itself is sufficient to discern the truth that various circulars or letters being issued by the State Government are merely an eye wash and in truth the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018 is not being properly implemented by the State respondents," the Court observed while disposing of the plea directing the State to implement the Witness Protection Scheme.
In December 2020, the Allahabad High Court had issued notice to the UP Government on a PIL (public interest litigation) seeking effective implementation of the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018.
In September 2020, the Madras High Court had expressed displeasure over the non-implementation of the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018. 
"Though the Witness Protection Scheme has been evolved in the year 2018, still the system is not providing confidence to the witnesses to come out with the truth as against the hard-core criminals", observed the Bench.

 The Supreme Court on Tuesday held that educational qualification is a valid ground for classification between persons of the same class in matters of promotion.
In the judgment delivered in the case Chandan Banerjee & Ors v. Krishna Prosad Ghosh & Ors, a bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli held that such classification on the basis of educational qualification is not violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
Holding so, the Court upheld the validity of separate eligibility conditions for promotion to Supernumerary Assistant Engineers having diploma and degrees in Kolkata Municipal Corporation. 
The judgment authored by Justice Chandrachud observed that the legislature or delegatee in matters of public policy and public employment must be given sufficient room to decide the quality of individuals it seeks to employ as against different positions.
Principles on classification
Relying on the Apex Court decisions in State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Trilokinath Khosa (1974) 1 SCC 19, State of Mysore v. P Narasing Rao AIR 1968 SC 349 ; Ganga Ram v. Union of India (1970) 1 SCC 377, Union of India v. Dr (Mrs) SB Kohli (1973) 3 SCC 592 and Roshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India AIR 1967 SC 1889; Roop Chand Adlakha v. Delhi Development Authority and others 1989 Supp (1) SCC 116; M Rathinaswami v. State of Tamil Nadu (2009) 2 SCC (LS) 101; State of Uttarakhand v. SK Singh (2019) 10 SCC 49, the bench observed that the following principles emerged:
 (i) Classification between persons must not produce artificial inequalities. The classification must be founded on a reasonable basis and must bear nexus to the object and purpose sought to be achieved to pass the muster of Articles 14 and 16;
 (ii) Judicial review in matters of classification is limited to a determination of whether the classification is reasonable and bears a nexus to the object sought to be achieved. Courts cannot indulge in a mathematical evaluation of the basis of classification or replace the wisdom of the legislature or its delegate with their own;  (iii) Generally speaking, educational qualification is a valid ground for classification between persons of the same class in matters of promotion and is not violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution;  (iv) Persons drawn from different sources and integrated into a common class can be differentiated on grounds of educational qualification for the purpose of promotion, where this bears a nexus with the efficiency required in the promotional post;
 (v) Educational qualification may be used for introducing quotas for promotion for a certain class of persons; or may even be used to restrict promotion entirely to one class, to the exclusion of others; 
 (vi) Educational qualification may be used as a criterion for classification for promotion to increase administrative efficiency at the higher posts; and 
 (vii) However, a classification made on grounds of educational qualification should bear nexus to the purpose of the classification or the extent of differences in qualifications
Facts Of The Case 
 Calcutta Municipal Corporation Services (Common Cadres) Regulations ("Regulations") were notified by Kolkata Municipal Corporation ("KMC") on December 23, 1994, which were applicable to all the employees under all departments and offices and provided for management and control of common cadres, seniority and recruitment among other conditions of service. Rule 9 of the Regulations provided for the method of recruitment for the post of Assistant Engineers ("AE") and Subordinate Assistant Engineers ("SAE"). To provide three modes of appointment to the post of AE, the Regulations were modified on August 7, 1997, and the KMC thereafter modified the Recruitment Regulations for the post of AE and notified them by a circular dated February 20, 2002.
 The circular dated February 20, 2002, was challenged in a writ before the High Court which was disposed with granting liberty to the petitioners to make a representation before the KMC. In an effort to remove stagnation in promotion to the next higher post of AE from the post of SAE, a circular was issued dated June 17, 2008 which was called as "first career advancement scheme" as it awarded basic scale of pay (Rs. 8,000 - 275/- 1000) of an AE to SAEs who have completed twenty years of satisfactory service in the KMC.
 The KMC on July 3, 2012 issued a circular ("impugned circular")which was considered to be the second career advancement scheme that stipulated the creation of supernumerary AE posts for SAEs holding a diploma and having completed twenty-five years of services and SAEs holding a degree and having completed thirteen years of services (out of which 5 years were as degree holder). In pursuance of the July 3 circular, an office order dated July 5, 2021 was published which had names of the SAE's who had been promoted to the post of AE against the supernumerary posts.
 Aggrieved, the SAEs possessing a diploma in engineering approached the High Court. The Single Judge of the High Court on October 6, 2015 observed that when persons having different educational qualifications are subject to a common recruitment process and are selected thereafter, a subsequent classification in that cadre would be in violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The Single Judge also observed that the classification for promotion was not made to reward those SAEs who had improved their educational qualification during service, but instead was a benefit granted to all degree holders.
 On the contrary, in letter patent appeal, the Division Bench of the High Court by order dated January 25, 2019 upheld the validity of the impugned circular and gradation list and observed that classification made on the basis of educational qualifications for supernumerary appointments to the higher post of Assistant Engineer was valid.
 Aggrieved by the order dated January 25, 2019 the Division Bench, SAE's possessing diploma in engineering approached the Top Court.
 Submissions Of Counsel 
 Appearing for the SAE's possessing diploma, Senior Counsel Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya submitted that the effect of the impugned circular would be that a junior SAE holding a degree would be promoted faster than a senior SAE holding a diploma and having more experience. It was also his contention that the High Court had failed to appreciate the ratio laid down in State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Shri Trilokinath Khosa (1974) 1 SCC 19 in which the Top Court had upheld separate channels of promotion for degree holders and diploma holders as they had been recruited through different channels on the basis of their qualifications.
 Appearing for KMC, Advocate Sujoy Mondal contended that the Recruitment Regulations provided that educational qualification was one of the criteria for recruitment as well as promotion in the Engineering Service of KMC. It was also his contention that the impugned circular's purpose was to open promotion avenues for stagnating SAE's and that neither any substantive promotional post of AE or any financial benefit was granted to SAE's through the impugned circular.
 Representing the degree-holding SAE's, Advocate Amit Sharma contended that the present case was similar to Roop Chand Adlakha v. Delhi Development Authority and Others, 1989 Supp (1) SCC 116 where category of Junior Engineers comprise of graduates and diploma holders and a rule providing for different length of qualifying service for promotion was challenged and the Top Court while upholding the rule had observed that differences in educational qualification could be compensated by difference in length of experience required in feeder post.
 Court's Observations 
Observing that the reading of State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Shri Trilokinath Khosa (1974) 1 SCC 19 as urged by the SAE's holding diploma was fundamentally flawed, the Top Court observed that,
 "The appellants have sought to lay emphasis on the fact that the decision in Trilokinath Khosa (supra) was dependent on the existence of two different sources of recruitment, while in the present case there is a single source of recruitment. To read the decision in this light is to miss the wood for the trees. In Trilokinath Khosa (supra), the Court had adverted to the well-established principle that once direct recruits and promotees are integrated into a common pool, they cannot be treated differently based on the 'source of recruitment'. This however does not imply that they cannot be classified on other reasonable grounds. Thus, whether there are two different streams of recruitment, or a single source of recruitment merged into a common pool, the classification that was upheld in Trilokinath Khosa (supra) was based on the educational qualification which was linked to the purpose of enhancing administrative efficiency in the organization. We are unable to agree with the submission of the appellants that the decision in Trilokinath Khosa (supra) is not applicable in the present case."
 The bench while upholding the High Court's view further observed that, 
 "The impugned circular indicates that these supernumerary posts were created for removal of stagnation amongst SAEs. Although that may be the stated goal of the impugned circular, KMC has urged before this Court that the distinction in education qualification for promotion has been made for the purpose of enhancing administrative efficiency. It cannot be denied that SAEs once promoted to the post of an AE in these supernumerary posts would be performing the task and functions of an AE. Thus, it is not merely a change in the designation of an SAE to an AE, but involves an increase in workload, supervisory functions, and performance of the regular functions of an AE. Since that is the case, we do not find any reason why the rationale underlying the need for higher degree-holders in the AE cadre through regular promotion would not be applicable in the case of supernumerary posts."
"While creating supernumerary posts, KMC has not completely restricted the promotional avenues of diploma-holder SAEs who have stagnated in their service. It has provided adequate opportunity to them to advance in their career, although on different terms and conditions. Thus, the promotional policy of KMC for supernumerary posts is not irrational or arbitrary or to the detriment of diploma holder SAEs. In matters of public policy and public employment, the legislature or its delegate must be given sufficient room to decide the quality of individuals it seeks to employ as against different positions. As long as these decisions are not arbitrary, this Court must refrain from interfering in the policy domain,"  the bench observed.

The Orissa High Court has clarified that a complainant need not mention the detailed particulars of every single act of domestic violence in the complaint itself. Thus, even a prima facie disclosure of acts of violence would be sufficient to maintain a complaint under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDV Act).
 While rejecting a revision petition praying to drop the proceedings, the Single Judge Bench of Justice Sashikanta Mishra observed,
 “After perusing the complaint petition, this Court is of the considered view that some allegations have been made undoubtedly in general terms but then it is not expected of the complainant to cite the detailed particulars of every single such act that may be treated as an act of domestic violence.”
 Factual Background
 The petitioners are the parents-in-law of the opposite party, who married their son on 13.12.2015. It was alleged that she was subjected to domestic violence by her husband and in-laws on different grounds including for additional dowry. After being tortured regularly, the opposite party was constrained to file a complaint under Section 12 of the PWDV Act in the Court of SDJM, Berhampur. 
 The petitioners appeared and filed an application to drop the proceeding against them as there was hardly any material to proceed against them. However, the SDJM rejected their plea holding that the application clearly makes out a case against them. Subsequently, they preferred an appeal before the Court of Sessions and to their dismay, the Appellate Court also held that the complaint petition prima facie reveals a case of domestic violence. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed.
 Being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioners approached the High Court in the present revision.
 Contentions of the Petitioners
 Surya Prasad Mishra, senior counsel for the petitioners contended that if the averments made in the complaint petition are viewed objectively, it would reveal that the allegations are directed mainly against the husband. He argued, firstly there are no allegations as such to show commission of domestic violence and secondly, the same are too general in nature to be taken note of judicially. 
 He also submitted that there is a tendency to implicate all the in-laws and other family members only to harass them and therefore, he prayed the Court to judiciously separate the “grain from the chaff”. To buttress his arguments, he placed reliance on Shyamlal Devda & Ors. v. Parimala.
 Contentions of the Opposite Party
 S.K. Pradhan, advocate for the opposite party contended that ‘strict rules of pleading’ are not applicable to a complaint filed under the Domestic Violence Act. He also submitted that having regard for the statutory intent of protecting women from domestic violence, it would suffice if the complaint prima facie contains allegations which can be subsequently proved by adducing evidence. 
 He submitted that there are enough materials to show that the opposite party was subjected to physical, mental, verbal and emotional torture by the petitioners at different points of time and thus, both the courts below have rightly rejected the contentions advanced by them.
 Court’s Observations
 After perusing the complaint as a whole, the Court acknowledged the averments made therein to the effect that the husband of the complainant used to exhibit violent behaviour and the petitioners allegedly encouraged him to do so and also restrained the complainant from disclosing the same to her parents. 
 Further, the Bench was of the view that though some of the allegations have been made in general terms, it is not expected of the complainant to explain the ‘detailed particulars’ of every single such act of domestic violence Accordingly, the Court noted,
 “Thus, while the main allegations appear to be directed against the husband, the role of the present petitioners appears to be confined to supporting their son and in omitting to restrain him from exhibiting violent behavior towards the complainant. Read as a whole, it cannot be said that the averments do not make out a case of domestic violence against the petitioners. On the contrary, this Court is of the view that the averments, prima facie, show acts of domestic violence by the petitioners against the complainant by way of commission as well as omission.” 
 However, it clarified that the allegations need to be proved in an appropriate proceeding before the competent Court to hold the petitioners guilty. But at this preliminary stage, the allegations made in the complaint would suffice to continue the proceedings against them.
 The Court also said that Shyamlal Devda (supra) can be easily distinguished factually as in the said case several other family members apart from the husband and parents-in-law were impleaded as parties without any specific allegations of domestic violence against them. Under such circumstances, the Apex Court had observed that in the absence of specific allegations, the case of domestic violence was liable to be quashed against the relatives.
 Resultantly, the revision petition was dismissed being devoid of merit.

The Karnataka High Court has said that recommendation made by Lokayukta for imposition of a particular penalty on a government official after due inquiry made does not take away the power of the disciplinary authority to impose a lesser penalty on the official.
A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna rejected the petition filed by the Karnataka Lokayuktha questioning an order dated 06.09.2021 by which the second respondent (Chandrashekhar) was imposed a penalty, which falls short of a recommendation made by it for imposition of particular penalty. 
The bench said “The power of the disciplinary authority to exercise discretion cannot be taken away merely because a recommendation is made by the Lokayukta for imposition of particular penalty.” 
Chandrashekhar was an accused in an alleged case of accepting and receiving a bribe of Rs.700, in the year 2009. He was acquitted in the matter on the ground that there was no work pending with him, for him to demand or accept a bribe. 
Simultaneously, the report under Sub-Section 3 of Section 12 of the Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984, was prepared and furnished to the Government, seeking entrustment of departmental enquiry to the Lokayukta under Rule 14A of the Karnataka Civil Services (CCA) Rules. The government vide order dated 22.07.2011, entrusted the inquiry to the hands of the Lokayukta.
The Lokayukta conducts an enquiry and holds that the allegations against the second respondent are proved and accordingly submits an enquiry report, recommending imposition of penalty of compulsory retirement from service against him. On receipt of the recommendation of imposition of such penalty, the disciplinary authority, after on consideration of the material placed before it, resolves to impose a penalty of reversion in grade of the petitioner instead of compulsory retirement. 
The Counsel for Lokayuktha contended that “Once the recommendation is made, the reduction of penalty can only happen in accordance with law. There are no reasons indicated as to why the penalty against the second respondent is reduced to that of reversion from what was recommended.” 
The Government opposed the plea saying “It is the discretion vested with the disciplinary authority to impose a penalty or otherwise and the petitioner–Lokayukta cannot be considered to be an aggrieved person against the orders passed by the disciplinary authority imposing a particular penalty.” 
The court made reference to judgement passed by it in W.P.No.12733/2021 which came to be disposed on 25.01.2022, wherein it was held that Lokayuktha has no locus to challenge the decision of the Cabinet. Thus it had dismissed the petition filed by the Lokayuktha on account of lack of locus, as they are not, and cannot be the person aggrieved. 
Following which it held “In the light of the afore-quoted order passed by this Court and statutory framework of the Act, the power of the disciplinary authority to exercise discretion cannot be taken away merely because a recommendation is made by the Lokayukta for imposition of particular penalty.” 
It added “I do not find any warrant to interfere in the case at hand, in the peculiar circumstances.”

The Supreme Court on Monday observed that remedies under Article 226 of the Constitution are available and intervention is warranted when disciplinary authority's findings are malafide or perverse, not based on evidence or are based on consideration of irrelevant material or by ignoring relevant material, or are such that they could not have been rendered by any reasonable person placed in like circumstances.
The bench of Justices KM Joseph and S Ravindra Bhat was considering a civil appeal assailing Calcutta High Court's judgment dated December 16, 2008 ("impugned judgment").
In the impugned judgment, the division bench had set aside Single Judge's decision of dismissing the respondent's challenge to his dismissal from bank's service.
While dismissing the appeal in United Bank Of India V. Biswanath Bhattacharjee the bench said, 
"The bank is correct, when it contends that an appellate review of the materials and findings cannot ordinarily be undertaken, in proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution. Yet, from H.C. Goel onwards, this court has consistently ruled that where the findings of the disciplinary authority are not based on evidence, or based on a consideration of irrelevant material, or ignoring relevant material, are mala fide, or where the findings are perverse or such that they could not have been rendered by any reasonable person placed in like circumstances, the remedies under Article 226 of the Constitution are available, and intervention, warranted. For any court to ascertain if any findings were beyond the record (i.e., no evidence) or based on any irrelevant or extraneous factors, or by ignoring material evidence, necessarily some amount of scrutiny is necessary. A finding of "no evidence" or perversity, cannot be rendered sans such basic scrutiny of the materials, and the findings of the disciplinary authority. However, the margin of appreciation of the court under Article 226 of the Constitution would be different; it is not appellate in character."
Factual Background 
The respondent ("employee") on January 18, 1971 was appointed as a cashier cum clerk by the bank and was later promoted to Junior Management Officer Scale-1. From December 14, 1988 to May 30, 1990 he served as a branch manager and on October 23, 1997 disciplinary proceedings were initiated against alleging his complicity in 5 major charges issued by the bank.
The charges against the respondent were that he disbursed loans in favor of 12 fictitious persons in connection with the Integrated Rural Development Project introduced by the Central Government and not reflecting the appropriate subsidy amount in the bank's subsidy register.
Other charges against the employee were of deliberately ensuring missing of relevant papers in connivance with another employee and misappropriating the amount of ₹ 60,000/- forming the subsidy component.
The bank conducted an enquiry against the respondent for denying the charges. Based on the report submitted by the Enquiry Officer, the Disciplinary Authority on October 7, 2002 terminated respondent's employment.
The employee appealed this order which was dismissed on April 28, 2003. Aggrieved, the employee approached the Calcutta High Court which was dismissed by the Single Judge on May 15, 2007. The employee then again filed an appeal which was allowed by the Division Bench ("impugned judgment"). By the impugned judgment the division bench while allowing the appeal set aside the orders of the appellate and disciplinary authorities.
Submission Of Counsels 
Appearing for the bank, Counsel urged that the High Court re-appreciated the evidence and altered the finding on facts of the disciplinary authority on the ground of insufficiency of evidence which was contrary to the settled proposition that courts, in judicial review, cannot weigh the evidence appreciated by a domestic tribunal.
Referring to the judgments in UP State Road Transport Corporation v Har Narain Singh 1998 (9) SCC 220; State Bank of India v Ram Dinkar Punde 2006 (7) SCC 212 and Government of A.P & Ors. v Mohd. Narsulla Khan 2006 (2) SCC 373, it was contended that the High Court erred in acting as an appellate authority and such action was in the teeth of law laid down by Top Court in several decisions. Counsel further argued that the impugned judgment was in error in holding that the enquiry officer's finding of guilt, leading to the employee's dismissal, was not based on any evidence.
On the other hand, Advocate Kunal Chaterjee on employee's behalf argued that the employee was found guilty in the enquiry proceedings and that the findings were not based on any evidence and were purely conjectural and clearly perverse.
Counsel further contended that the charge sheet was issued much later and the enquiry was conducted seven years later. It was also his contention that the management withheld documents which were directed to be produced in the enquiry which caused serious prejudice to the respondent as their production would have vindicated his position.
He further argued that though the scope of judicial review in departmental proceedings was restricted, clearly where it was shown that the outcome of the enquiry was either procedurally unfair or illegal, or its outcomes were based on findings that were based on irrelevant facts, without taking into consideration relevant facts, or are manifestly unreasonable, the court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, could interfere with the punishment imposed.
Supreme Court's Analysis
The bench in the judgment authored by Justice S Ravindra Bhat to adjudicate on the issue referred to the Top Court's judgements in Union of India v. H.C. Goel (1964) 4 SCR 718, T.N.C.S. Corpn. Ltd. v. K. Meerabai, (2006) 2 SCC 255, B.C. Chaturvedi v. Union of India (1995) 6 SCC 749, Bank of India v. Degala Suryanarayana (1999) 5 SCC 762, In Moni Shankar v. Union of India (2008) 3 SCC 484 and State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur v. Nemi Chand Nalwaya (2011) 4 SCC 584
Recollecting Bernard Schwartz who said that judicial review- of administrative decisions: warrants a minimum level of scrutiny, the bench opined that the division bench conducting a kind of scrutiny that it did could not be a factor to hold its decision erroneous.
Relying on Roop Singh Negi v. Punjab National Bank (2009) 2 SCC 570 and J.D. Jain v Management of State Bank of India18 and State Bank of India v Hemant Kumar 2011 (2) SCC 22, the bench said, 
"In the present case, however, the confessional statement was not by the respondent. Those who authored the confession, did not depose in the enquiry. Furthermore, no witness who heard the authors of the confession, deposed to it. At best then, that document bound the authors, not third parties, like the respondent. The enquiry officer clearly erred by relying on such extraneous matters, as the respondent could not be made a scapegoat for the confession of others, especially with regard to his role. The bank's charge about his complicity had to be proved by evidence. This document, containing others' confession, could not have been used against him."
While dismissing the appeal, the bench said, 
"The appeal is unmerited. The appellant bank is directed to ensure that the respondent's services are deemed to be reinstated, and calculate all his benefits, including arrears of salary, pay increase (as applicable), increments, and all consequential benefits, and calculate his terminal benefits, and fix his pension, if admissible to him under the bank's regulations. The determination of these benefits shall be undertaken, and the payment of all amounts be made, within three months from date of this judgment. The appeal is dismissed without order on costs.."
Case Title: United Bank Of India V. Biswanath Bhattacharjee| Civil Appeal No. 8258 Of 2009
Coram: Justices KM Joseph and S Ravindra Bhat

The Allahabad High Court on Monday, while denying bail to alleged Popular Front of India (PFI) leader Abdul Razaq Peediyakkal in the PMLA Case, observed that he can't claim parity with co-accused Siddique Kappan as Kappan is facing the allegation that Rs.5,000/- were transferred in the Bank account of co-accused Atikur Rahman, whereas in the instant case against Abdul, the proceed of crime is in crores.
"So far as claim of parity with co-accused Sidhique Kappan is concerned, the role assigned to Sidhique Kappan is in respect of hatching a criminal conspiracy with K.A. Rauf Sherif. Except for the allegation that Rs.5,000/- were transferred in the Bank account of coaccused Atikur Rahman, there is no other transaction either in the Bank account of Sidhique Kappan or in the Bank account of the coaccused whereas the role of the present applicant is altogether different from that of co-accused," the bench of Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan observed.
It may be recalled that while granting bail to Kappan in connection with a Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) case in December 2022, the Allahabad High Court had taken note of the fact regarding this very allegation.

The case against Abdul
As per the case of ED, during the PMLA investigation against PFI, it came to light that more than Rs.100 Crore have been deposited in the accounts of PFI and its related entities over the years through hawala/ underground channels and through remittances sent to the accounts of members/ activists/office bearers of PFI/CFI and other related organizations.
Initially, the active participation of five accused persons came to notice through reliable pieces of evidence and materials who are: K.A. Rauf Sherif, Atikur Rehman, Masud Ahmed, Sidique Kappan, and Mohd. Alam.
However, in further investigation, the name of the present applicant (Abdul Razaq Peediyakkal) came to the notice, therefore, in the supplementary complaint, the applicant was also made the accused stating that he is a PFI member based in Kerala and Abu Dhabi and is involved in the illegal act of collecting and laundering funds for radical activities of PFI. 
The ED has also alleged that Peediyakkal was the largest shareholder of the Munnar Villa Vista Project (MVVP), which was set up allegedly with the motive to launder money collected from abroad and in India.
He was arrested on March 2022 and booked under Sections 3, 4 & 70 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. Seeking bail in the case, he moved to the High Court arguing that the case against him is not made out.
It was also submitted that the main conspirator in terms of the complaint of the ED, namely, K.A. Rauf Sherif was enlarged on bail by the Special Court for PMLA Cases under the PMLA in Feb 2021. Further, it was also argued that since co-accused Sidhique Kappan has been enlarged on bail, therefore, the present application may also be enlarged on bail on the basis of principles of parity.
Lastly, it was strongly argued that since the applicant was not named or not prosecuted for the predicate offence, his prosecution for money laundering won't be proper.
On the other hand, the Counsel for ED Kuldeep Srivastava, while stressing the role of Abdul in the instant case argued that allegations against him are serious and if he is released on bail, he may abscond or may influence the trial proceedings as the trial is pending consideration before the trial court where the charges have been framed.
Court's observations
Taking into account these submissions, the Court, at the outset rejected the argument of the applicant that his prosecution for money laundering was illegal as he was not named or not prosecuted for the predicate offence.
"It is clear that a person may not be involved in original criminal activity that had resulted in the generation of proceed of crime but he can join the main accused either as abettor or conspirator for committing the offence of money laundering by helping him in laundering the proceed of crime," the Court remarked as it referred to Bombay High Court's ruling in the case of Babulal Verma and Another Vs. Enforcement Directorate and Another, 2021 SCC OnLine Bom 392
Further, considering the facts and circumstances of the issue in question, the Court observed that the bail application also did not qualify the twin conditions of Section 45 of the PMLA inasmuch as at this stage it cannot be observed that the present applicant has not committed the offence for which the complaint has been filed against him.
"The proceed of crime is also in crores. The applicant is based at Abu Dhabi. The factum of guilt can be proved or disproved before the learned trial court. Learned counsel for the E.D. has informed that the trial in the present case is going on with good pace and the same may likely be concluded very soon, therefore, I am not inclined to grant bail to the present applicant...," the Court observed.
Consequently, rejecting the bail plea of Abdul, the Court directed the trial court to conclude the trial with an expedition, preferably within a period of six months by fixing a short date.

The Allahabad High Court has recently observed that receiving proper education is a Fundamental Right enshrined under Article 21-A of the Constitution of India.
The Bench of Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan and Justice Subhash Vidyarthi further observed that educational authorities must ensure that the grievance relating to the admission to an institution is redressed with promptness and does not remain unattended.
The case in brief
Essentially, the bench was dealing with the case of one Tanishk Srivastava, an 8th-class student. He appeared in the entrance test held on March 20, 2022, for admission as Resident Scholar in the La Martiniere College, Lucknow for taking admission in Class VIII.
On March 25, 2022, the results were declared and Tanishk was declared successful and eligible for admission in Class-VIII as Resident Scholar. However, due to his mother's serious illness and his father being out of the station, he could not get admitted as Resident Scholar.
Therefore, his father moved an application on April 4, 2022, before the school management and prayed that instead of treating his son as a Resident Scholar, he may be given admission as Day Scholar as he is ready to complete all required formalities including the fees.
When the appellant/writ petitioner, the father of the candidate was not informed about the fate of the admission of his son till April 18, 2022, he filed a writ petition before the Court. The same was dismissed by a single judge.
Challenging the same, he moved the instant appeal before the division bench.
Court's observations
The court upheld the order of the single judge who had dismissed the writ plea on the ground that since the institution was an unaided minority private institution, therefore, the writ petition against it may not be entertained.
The Court, in this regard, relied upon the July 2016 order passed by the Apex Court in Civil Appeal No.7030 of 2016, Committee of Management, La Martiniere College, Lucknow, and Anr Vs. Vatsal Gupta and Others.
However, before dismissing the appeal, the Court did observe that the institution should have forwarded the specific information (whether he could be admitted to the school as a resident scholar) to the parents of such student at the earliest so that appropriate steps could be taken by the parents of such student.
"This is not a case where the student has not qualified the entrance examination for getting admission in particular class i.e. Class-VIII but this is a case where such student has qualified such entrance examination as Resident Scholar but due to compelling and unavoidable circumstances he could not be able to get admission as Resident Scholar. Therefore, in such compelling circumstances, at least on the basis of principles of equity, it was bare minimum required on the part of the Principal of the institution to apprise the parents of the student that the institution would be unable to provide admission to their ward in Class-VIII as a Day Scholar student," the Court further added.
The bench also opined that so if the request of the student/parents of the student was not liable to be accepted by the school, this decision should have been immediately conveyed to the parents so that, the Court added, the student could get admission in any other institution for receiving proper education inasmuch as to receive proper education is a Fundamental Right enshrined under Article 21-A of the Constitution of India.
Further, stressing that whatever is possible under the law or under the principles of equities, a prompt decision should be taken and intimated to all aggrieved so that the consequential steps could be taken well in time, the Court directed that the copy of the order be provided to the following opposite parties:
 - Principal Secretary, Primary Education, Civil Secretariat, Bapu Bhawan, Lucknow. 
- District Magistrate, Lucknow. 
- Director, Indian School Certificate Examination Board, Pragati House, 3rd Floor 47-48, Nehru Place, New Delhi. 
- Principal, La Martiniere College, Martin Purva Road, Lucknow-226001.

In a rare instance, the Bombay High Court recently directed the Superintendent of Amravati Central Prison to pay the legal expenses or the 'cost of a petition' for denying furlough to a 60-year-old blast convict on "stereotyped reasons".
 "Considering the manner in which the impugned order has been passed, recording some worn out reasons, thereby revealing non-application of mind to the important and relevant facts of the case and also the fact that, this is not the first occasion when the petitioner has been required to experience inconvenience, delay and injustice, we are of the view that prayer made by the learned counsel for the petitioner is reasonable and deserves to be granted," the court observed while imposing costs. 
 A division bench of Justices S.B Shukre and M.W Chandwani noted that 1997-98 Jama Masjid Serial Blast convict Mohd. Sagir Bashir Khan was released on furlough six times in the past and he had surrendered on time and hadn't jumped furlough even once. The court ordered Khan's release on furlough based on his entitlement within seven days. 
 The court noted that even earlier Khan was forced to approach the HC as furlough was denied by the DIG Prisons, Nagpur for stereotyped reasons despite the DIG of the prison department being duty bound to pass a reasoned order. 
 "The requirement of recording of reasons under Rule 8(7) of the Prisons Rules, 1959 is not an empty formality and certainly, is not a license for passing an order recording same old reasons almost like a cliché. It is a well settled principle of law that whenever there is discretion, it comes with responsibility to exercise it reasonably, fairly and in a manner as to fulfill the object of legislation under which it is given," the court said.
 The applications for furlough are decided under Rule 2 of Prisons (Bombay Furlough and Parole) Rules, 1959 by the Deputy Inspector General of Prisons (Regional).
 "The discretion conferred upon the sanctioning Authority i.e. the Deputy Inspector General of Prisons, who is respondent no. 1 here, is not unguided and uncanalized," said the court.
 Enumerating the consequences of denying relief without recording proper reasons, the bench said:
 "Whenever, such mechanical orders are passed, inconvenience [is caused] to the petitioner… putting additional burden on the State exchequer because of the requirement of the prisoner being provided with Legal Aid at the State expense for challenging the order come as inevitable consequences and casualty of justice follows, which can be avoided."
 The court said the sanctioning Authority under the Prisons Rules, 1959 must ensure exercise of due care and caution in deciding applications for furlough leave, while keeping in view the settled principles of law.
In 2004, a Sessions Court at Mumbai convicted Khan along with 10 others in a case related to a series of blasts between November 1997 to February 1998 at the Jama Masjid Mosque, inside various railway stations and trains.
Khan was found guilty for murder, conspiracy amongst various other sections of the IPC, Section 150(2) and Section 151 of the Indian Railways Act read with Section 120-B of IPC & Section 4 of Prevention of Damage to Public Properties Act. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. Khan was released six times in the past, in 2008, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2019 and 2021.
The bench held that the past conduct of persons like the petitioner in such matters is very important. 
 Moreover, generalized reasons like; the heinousness of the crime, public wrath, and possibility of disturbance of law-and-order situation, were not enough to deny furlough. 
"These reasons do not make any reference to any particular or specific instance on the basis of which one can make a conclusion that the petitioner may face violence out of public outrage that is still going on against him or that there would be possibility of disturbance of law and order."
 Accordingly the court ordered his release on furlough leave as per his entitlement subject to reasonable conditions.

The Gujarat High Court recently allowed the plea of a minor rape victim to terminate her 6 weeks old pregnancy, on the ground that if pregnancy continues, it would cause lifelong mental agony to the her coupled with socio-economic problems."Petitioner is pregnant because of forcible rape by the accused...because of continuation of pregnancy, it would cause or constitute a grave injury to...
The Gujarat High Court recently allowed the plea of a minor rape victim to terminate her 6 weeks old pregnancy, on the ground that if pregnancy continues, it would cause lifelong mental agony to the her coupled with socio-economic problems.
"Petitioner is pregnant because of forcible rape by the accused...because of continuation of pregnancy, it would cause or constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the minor – victim coupled with the fact that bearing and rearing of child in the womb would create a great mental agony to her for her entire life and invite many other socio-economical problems. This can be said to be a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman."
Justice Vipul Pancholi was hearing the application filed by a 17 years old rape victim. The same was allowed in accordance with Section 3 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act 2021.
The Judge noted that as per Section 3 of the MTP Act, 2021, where the length of pregnancy does not exceed 12 weeks, the registered Medical Practitioner and where such length of pregnancy exceed 12 weeks but does not exceed 20 weeks, two Medical Practitioners can terminate the pregnancy. But they have to form an opinion that the continuation of pregnancy would invoke a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury to her physical life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury to her physical or mental health or there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.
The brief facts of the case were that the accused person had kidnapped the Petitioner and had raped her following which an FIR was filed against him under Sections 363, 366, 376(n) of IPC and Sections 4, 5(L), 6, 8 and 12 of POCSO Act. It was found that the victim was pregnant by 6 weeks and 3 days and was undergoing severe mental agony. The father of the Petitioner, accordingly, produced a consent letter on her behalf to terminate her pregnancy. 
The Petitioner averred that the pregnancy would cause grave injury to her mental health and therefore, she should be permitted to terminate it. Reliance was placed on Ms Z vs State of Bihar (2018) 11 SCC 572 to show that in a case of pregnancy of 12 weeks, permission could be granted for termination. It was also prayed that the Respondent authorities conduct the medical termination of pregnancy with two qualified surgeons including Gynecologist, Obstetrician and others to avoid any physical harm.
 The Bench noted the opinion of the medical officers passed in reference to the victim after her medical examination in accordance with Section 3 of the MTP Act. It affirmed that after the medical examination of the victim, the doctors were of the opinion that she could undergo MTP with due risk of complications (haemorrhage, retained product of conception and infection). It was also recommended by the doctors that the procedure be performed without delay for the benefit of the Petitioner.
 Considering the health of the Petitioner and the precedents before it, the Court granted the prayer "with a view to save and protect the life of the petitioner – victim." It was directed that the doctors terminate the pregnancy with due risk after ANC profile report and hand over, in scientific manner, the tissues drawn from the foetus for DNA identification to the investigating officer, as well.

The Kerala High Court on Saturday held that the prosecution has every right to seek that the accused should surrender mobile phones for forensic examination under Section 79A of the Information Technology Act. The Court rejected the argument that the surrender of mobile phones will infringe the fundamental right against self-incrimination under Article 20(3) of the Constitution...
The Kerala High Court on Saturday held that the prosecution has every right to seek that the accused should surrender mobile phones for forensic examination under Section 79A of the Information Technology Act. The Court rejected the argument that the surrender of mobile phones will infringe the fundamental right against self-incrimination under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India.  
Accordingly, it directed actor Dileep and other accused to hand over six mobile phones to its Registrar General in a sealed box by 10.15 am on Monday in the alleged criminal conspiracy to kill police officers investigating the sensational 2017 sexual assault case.
After referring to a couple of landmark decisions in this area, Justice Gopinath P. ruled:
"Bound, as I am, by the law...I hold that the prosecution has every right to seek that the accused hand over the mobile phones in question for the purpose of forensic examination by an agency identified by the Central Government as 'Examiner of Electronic Evidence' under Section 79-A of the Information Technology Act, 2000."
Senior Advocate B. Raman Pillai appearing for the accused in the matter suggested that any direction to produce the mobile phones would amount to the violation of the right against self-incrimination guaranteed under Article 20(3) of the Constitution. 
However, Director General of Prosecutions T.A Shaji appearing for the prosecution vehemently argued that there is no question of violation of Article 20(3) as the direction to produce a document or a thing does not amount to self-incrimination. 
He added that the investigating agency has every power to demand the production of mobile phones in question as the data contained in the same has to be verified for the purpose of investigation. It was further submitted that the Karnataka High Court had recently considered this issue in Virendra Khanna v. State of Karnataka & Ors.  
After carefully perusing the arguments and advanced and the law laid down on this subject, the Court took the view that the issue raised was no longer res integra. 
To confirm this stand, the Court referred to an 11-judge bench decision of the Supreme Court State of Bombay v. Kathi Kalu Oghad [AIR 1962 SC 1809] where it was held that giving thumb impressions or impressions of foot/palm/fingers or specimen writings or showing parts of the body by way of identification does not violate Article 20(3). 
The Judge noted that this decision was relied on heavily by other landmark judgments such as K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (which held the right to privacy as a fundamental right) and Ritesh Sinha v. State of U.P. (which held that Magistrate can direct accused to give voice samples without his consent).
The Court also observed that in Virendra Khanna (supra), the Karnataka High Court had held so: 
"Mere providing of an access of to smartphone or e-mail account would not amount to being a witness, the information that is accessed by the Investigating officer on the smartphone and or the e-mail account being only access; to the data and/or documents, it is for the Investigating officer to prove and establish the same in a Court of law by following the applicable Rules of evidence." 
Finding force in the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Oghad (supra) and the Karnataka High Court in Virendra Khanna (supra), the Single Bench held that the prosecution was empowered to seek that the accused to hand over their mobile phones for the purpose of forensic examination.
The Court issued the order in the anticipatory bail plea moved by Dileep and others in the alleged criminal conspiracy to kill police officers investigating the sensational 2017 sexual assault case.
Case Title: P. Gopalakrishnan alias Dileep & Ors v. State of Kerala & Anr.

The Supreme Court Court Constitution Bench has by 3:2 majority upheld the validity of the 103rd Constitutional Amendment which introduced 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) in education and public employment. While Justices Dinesh Maheshwari, Bela Trivedi and JB Pardiwala upheld the 103rd Constitution Amendment, Justice S Ravindra Bhat wrote a dissenting judgment to strike it down. Chief Justice of India Uday Umesh Lalit concurred with the minority view of Justice Bhat. 
In their dissenting judgment however, Chief Justice of India UU Lalit and Justice S Ravindra Bhat said that reservation on economic criteria is per se not violative. Justice Bhat held that economic criteria can be used to provide reservation in education under Article 15 but not for the purpose of reservation in jobs under Article 16.
"...while the 'economic criteria' per se is permissible in relation to access of public goods (under Article 15), the same is not true for Article 16, the goal of which is empowerment, through representation of the community", Justice Bhat's judgment stated.
This article details the views expressed in the dissenting opinion by the bench.
I.	Classification Under 103rd Amendment Contradictory To The Essence Of "Equal Opportunity"
At the very outset, Justice Bhat, while regretting his inability to concur with the views expressed by the majority, stated that–
"This court has, for the first time in the seven decades of the Republic, sanctioned an exclusionary and discriminatory principle. Our Constitution does not speak the language of exclusion. In my considered opinion the amendment is the language of exclusion and violates the principle of justice, and thereby the basic structure."
 Elaborating further upon his opinion, Justice Bhat stated that the application of the doctrine of classification differentiated between the poorest sections of the society– one segment which consisted of the poorest of forward classes and other, the poorest who were subject to additional disabilities due to caste stigmatisation. He stated that the amendment was keeping the latter out of the new reservation benefit by making us believe that those getting social and educational backwardness based reservations were somehow more fortunate. This classification, as per Justice Bhat, was clearly "contradictory to the essence of equal opportunity." He added–
"If the Constitution means anything, it is that Articles 15(1), 15(2), 15(4), 16(1), 16(2) and 16(4) are one indefeasible code. This court has reiterated time and again that Articles 16(1) and 16(4) are the facets of the same equality principles. The characterisation of including the poor, that is, those who are qualified for economic eligibility among those under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) in the new reservation under 15(6) and 16(6) as bestowing double benefits is incorrect."
The dissenting opinion highlighted that the benefits granted to backward classes under the Constitution, could not be understood as a "free pass" as they were a reparative and compensatory mechanism meant to level the field, granted to those who had been unequals due to social stigmatisation. Justice Bhat, while reading out the dissent stated that excluding backward classes from the ambit of Articles 15(6) and 16(6) violated the non-exclusionary and non-discriminatory facet of equality code which thereby violated the basic structure of the Indian Constitution. 
II. Granting Benefits To Poor Permissible, Excluding Backward Classes Impermissible
The dissenting opinion clarified that granting benefits to the destitute or economically weaker sections of the society was not impermissible. However, it was the exclusion of backward classes from such benefits which was impermissible. Justice Bhat remarked–
"Destitution and economic poverty are markers of intelligible differentia forming the basis of the classification of which the impugned amendment is premised, on which ground the constitutional amendment is indefeasible. However, by excluding a large number of equally poor and destitute individuals based on social backwardness on legally acknowledged class stigmatisation, the amendment practises constitutionally prohibited forms of discrimination. The overarching principles on which 15(1), 15(2), 16(1) and 16(2) are based on, is that the practice of discrimination is impermissible...Such exclusion strikes at the heart of the equality code, specifically the non-discriminatory facet."
The opinion further highlighted that as per the Sinoh Commission Report, which was published in July 2010, based upon census of 2001 and statistics of 2004-2005, in all 31.7 crore people who were below poverty line, the SC population was 7.74 crore, which is 38% of the total SC population; ST population was 4.25 crore, which is 48% of total ST population; OBC population was 13.86 crores, which is 33.1% of total OBC population in the country and; the General category was 5.5 crore, which is 18.2% of the total general category population in India. Justice Bhat stated–
"These facts establish that the bulk of the economically weaker sections of the society belong to the classes which are described in Articles 15(4) and 16(4)."
III. State Can Make Provisions For Reservations For Admissions In Private Unaided Institutions
Regarding the question on whether the State could make provisions for reservations for admission in private, unaided institutions, Justice Bhat and CJI UU Lalit's opinion concurred with the majority. The opinion stated–
"As held in Pramati & Society for Unaided Private Schools, reservations in private institutions are not per se violative of basic structure. Thus, reservations as a concept cannot be ruled out. They (private, unaided institutions) may not be the State and State instrumentalities but these institutions also constitute material resources of the community in which the State has a vital interest. They are not merely set up because of the private and interests of the founders like shareholders in companies. Therefore, I hold that on the question 2, the amendment is valid but for the reasons of answering question 3, the amendment has to go."
IV. Breach Of 50% Ceiling Limit Would Lead To "Compartmentalisation" ; Reservations AreTemporary And Exceptional
Justice Bhat stated that caution had to be exercised in dealing with the issue pertaining to the 50% ceiling limit as the breach of 50% limit was the principal ground of attack to the 76th Constitutional Amendment, 1994, which had been challenged in a batch of petitions pending before the Supreme Court. he added–
"The view of the members constituting this bench on the creation of another class which can be the recipient of up to 10% of reservations over and above 50% permitted under Article 15(4) and 16(4), in my considered opinion, therefore has a direct bearing on the likely outcome in the challenge in that case."
Therefore, while exercising caution in that regard, Justice Bhat stated that permitting the breach of the 50% rule become "a gateway of further infractions which in fact would result in compartmentalisation." He added–
"The rule of equality would then be reduced to the right of reservation, leading us back to the days of Champakam Dorairajan. In this regard the observations of Ambedkar have to be kept in mind that reservations are to be seen as temporary and exceptional or they could eat up the rule of equality."
V. Fraternity Embedded In India's Ethos & Culture
As departing comments, Justice Bhat stated that the fraternal principle was deeply embedded to the nation's ethos and culture. He said–
"The specific provisions which form part of the equality code are inextricably intertwined with fraternity as well. It is fraternity and no other idea which says that ultimately all individuals are human beings, all go through the same natural process, subject to the same physical limitations, and finally will leave this world. The idea of fraternity is to awaken to the consciousness of each member of society that the institution which are created, the ideas we develop, and the progress we want cannot be without cooperation and harmony."
He also narrated an excerpt from Swami Vivekananda's speech in Chicago in 1893–
"In the face of this evidence, if anybody dreams of the exclusive survival of his own religion and the destruction of the others, I pity him from the bottom of my heart, and point out to him that upon the banner of every religion will soon be written in spite of resistance: 'Help and not fight', 'Assimilation and not Destruction', 'Harmony and Peace and not Dissension'."
VI. Summary of the Dissent
1. Whether the 103rd Constitution Amendment is violative of basic structure for providing reservation solely on the basis of economic criteria?
On this question, it was held that the State's compelling interest to fulfil the object set out in the directive principles through special provisions on the basis of economic criteria was legitimate. It was held that–
"Special provisions made on objective economic criteria is per se not violative. Reservation is designed as a powerful tool to enable equal access and equal opportunities. Introducing economic basis for reservations as a new category is permissible."
2. Whether the amendment is violative of basic structure for excluding the poor among the SC/ST/OBC categories from EWS Quota?
 As per the dissent, the exclusion of backward classes was violative of basic structure. On this note, Justice Bhat stated–
"The othering of socially and economically backward sections, including SCs, STs and OBCs, by excluding them based on no other ground but that they enjoy pre-existing benefits is to reap fresh injustice based on caste disability. The exclusionary clause operates in an utterly arbitrary matter. First, it others those subjected to socially questionable and outlawed practises. Secondly, for the purpose of new reservations, the exclusion operates against socially disadvantaged groups absolutely by confining them within their allotted reservation quota. Thirdly, it denies a chance of mobility from reserved quotas based upon caste discrimination, to a reservation benefit based only on economic criteria. The entire exclusionary principle is Orwellian so to say that all are entitled to be considered regardless of their caste or class, yet only those who belong to other classes or caste would be considered and socially disadvantaged classes would be ineligible."
As per the opinion, the total exclusion of constitutionally recognised backward classes was nothing but discrimination which reached to the level of undermining and destroying the equality code, particularly the principle of non-discrimination. Therefore, the impugned amendment was held to be arbitrary as resulting in hostile discrimination of SEBCs. 
It was held that–
"While the economic criteria is per se permissible in relation to access to public goods under Article 15, the same was not true for Article 16, the role of which was empowerment through representation in the community."

CASE TITLE: Janhit Abhiyan v. Union Of India with 32 connected matters | W.P.(C)NO.55/2019 and connected issues

The Bombay High Court recently came to the rescue of a widow, who was denied compassionate appointment in place of her deceased husband who was working as a Peon in an educational premises.She was denied the benefit vide an order passed by the Education Department stating that the proposal seeking sanction to the new staffing pattern is pending with the Government and as yet no sanction...
The Bombay High Court recently came to the rescue of a widow, who was denied compassionate appointment in place of her deceased husband who was working as a Peon in an educational premises.
She was denied the benefit vide an order passed by the Education Department stating that the proposal seeking sanction to the new staffing pattern is pending with the Government and as yet no sanction is received from the Government. 
Setting aside this communication, the bench of Justices Sadhana S. Jadhav and SG Dige observed,
"there is no necessity to have sanction to the new staffing pattern for appointment on compassionate ground, therefore, the petition deserves to be allowed."
While doing so, the bench took note of the High Court's observations in Yogita Shivsing Nikam v. State of Maharashtra and others, where while considering similar facts it was held thus: 
"To say the least, we are shocked by the stand taken by the State Government, which is not only against logic and reason, but is in complete contradiction to the law crystallized by this court in numerous judgments. It is unconscionable for the State to canvass such grounds virtually rendering the bereaved family to starvation. We find that the State has consistently ensured that not a single Government Resolution, pertaining to ban on recruitment, stay on filling in vacant posts and prohibition on appointments until the staffing pattern of the non teaching posts is formalized, would apply to appointments made on compassionate grounds. This Court has also consistently taken a view that compassionate appointment would be an exception to the mandatory rule of following specific selection procedure for recruitment on vacant posts or on newly created posts."
The High Court had then proceeded to warn that in case it comes across any case refusing approval to a compassionate appointment which is otherwise legally sustainable satisfying the eligibility criteria, it would issue directions recommending strict disciplinary action against the Education Officer and would not hesitate to initiate contempt of Court proceedings against the persons responsible.
"They are interpreting the Government Resolutions in the most inappropriate manner, despite the crystalised position of law. Because of such acts of the Education Officers, widows and eligible candidates are compelled to rush to this Court after having suffered mental and physical agony of a personal loss of a sole bread earner and also spend on litigation which is costly these days. We would also impose heavy costs to be recovered from the salaries of such Education Officers for the pain caused to such petitioners," the High Court had added further.
In view of the above, the writ petition was allowed. 
Case Title : Smt. Varsha Deepak Desale v The State of Maharashtra

The Kerala High Court has reiterated that a plea of adjustment can be pressed into service only if raised before the institution of the suit and not afterwards, unlike a plea for set-off.
Justice A. Badharudeen also noted that leave for filing additional written statements is usually not granted by courts if they are filed after a long delay.
"The legal position regarding adjustment is no more res integra on the point that a plea of adjustment by payment is definitely and essentially a different plea and can be pressed into service only if the same was raised before the institution of the suit and not afterwards."
 The Judge added that to determine whether a plea raised in defence is a plea of set-off or of payment by adjustment it has to be ascertained as to whether a separate action could be maintained by the defendant on the basis of his claim. 
"If he could institute a separate suit for realisation of the amount due to him, it is a case of set-off. If the adjustment was made prior to the filing of the suit by the plaintiff and a plea is taken to that effect, it would be a plea of adjustment by payment."
The respondent herein had approached an Additional Sub Court claiming an amount from the petitioner herein in 2011. The petitioner initially filed a written statement in the suit and then filed an additional written statement ten years later, putting up a plea of `adjustment' of the suit amount towards the damages sustained by him. 
The trial court, however, dismissed the application. Challenging this decision, the petitioner moved the High Court through Advocate Millu Dandapani.
Advocate K.V. Pavithran appearing for the respondent argued that there is no pleading in the original written statement regarding the adjustment and the amount which he wanted to adjust is yet to be decided by the trial court. Further, unilateral adjustment is not permitted in law and he could not raise a totally new case by way of adjustment through an additional written statement.
The Court noted that to raise a plea of adjustment, the permission of the Court contemplated under Order 8 Rule 9 is mandatory. After examining precedents on this issue, it was noted that ordinarily at a much-belated stage, leave for filing additional written statements is usually not granted.
It was also highlighted that when set-off is raised in the written statement, the defendant has to pay a court fee but no court fee is to be paid for a plea of `adjustment'. That apart, the Judge observed that no pecuniary liability arises till the Court determines that the party complaining of the breach is entitled to damages.
"The Court in the first place must decide that the other side is liable and then, it should proceed to assess and quantify the liability. Till the said determination, there is no liability at all upon the other side and no `adjustment' in regard to the damages which is not quantified is liable to sustain"
Therefore, it was found that the plea of `adjustment' canvassed by filing an additional written statement in this case appears to be untenable. The petition was accordingly dismissed. 
Case Title: Southern Dredging Co (P) Ltd v. K. Muhammed Haji 

The Bombay High Court on Friday granted Videocon Group Chairman Venugopal Dhoot interim bail in a plea alleging illegal arrest by the Central Bureau of Investigation.
 The interim order was passed by Justice Revati Mohite Dere and Justice Prithviraj Chavan.
 In his petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, Dhoot has sought quashing of the special CBI court’s remand orders of 26, 28 and 29 December, 2022 and asked the high court to declare his arrest in gross violation of Sections 41 and 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and Article 14, 19(1)(d) and 21 of the Constitution of India.
 The same bench had earlier granted interim bail to Venugopal’s co-accused ex-ICICI bank MD Chanda Kochhar and her husband Deepak Kochhar observing that non-confession of an accused doesn't amount to non-cooperation, and an accused must be released forthwith if arrest doesn’t satisfy Section 41 CrPC. 
 Dhoot was arrested after the Kochhars and booked under Sections 7, 13(2) r/w 13(1) & (d) of PC Act, 420 & 120 B of IPC in the case being investigated by CBI
 The Case 
 The CBI began investigating the accused in January 2018 after reports that Videocon's Dhoot paid a firm - he had allegedly set up with Deepak and two relatives, six months after his firm got a Rs 3,250 crore loan from ICICI Bank in 2012.
 The irregularities were with regard to the grant of six high-value loans worth around Rs 1,575 crore to five firms of the Videocon Group between June 2009 and October 2011. The loans were granted in contravention of the rules and policy of sanctioning committee, the agency has alleged.
 These loans were later termed as non-performing assets resulting in wrongful loss to ICICI bank and wrongful gain to the borrowers and accused persons, the CBI said. The total misappropriation is to the tune of Rs.1,730 crore as of April 26, 2012, according to the agency.
 Arguments 
 Advocate Sandeep Ladda along with Advocate Viral Babar had pointed towards Dhoot’s 'arrest memo' to submit that the only reason cited is that he "kept changing his versions and therefore not cooperating with the investigation."
 Ladda submitted that the loans taken from ICICI bank in 2009 were repaid by 2012. To demonstrate cooperation, he had said the ED didn’t find it necessary to arrest him in the money laundering case pertaining to the same loan transaction and that he appeared before the ED over 31 times.
 Advocate Ladda had told the court that Dhoot was summoned on December 15 but he was unable to appear due to health reasons, however, he did go before the agency on December 22, 2022.
 But, Senior Advocate Raja Thakare for CBI submitted that the ED investigation could not be compared to the CBI investigation as there are other charges like Section 120B (conspiracy), and offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act that the CBI is investigating.
 On the point that there was an at least three-year delay in arrest, Thakare said the agency needs to make an arrest only after it has enough material. "There are innumerable transactions woven in such a manner ... at that particular stage, the entire material would not have been available with the agency."
 He added that the CBI gets the custody of the accused only for a limited period therefore the time must be used prudently.
 Thakare disagreed with Dhoot's submission on cooperation. "They were all called to be confronted with each other on 22nd December but all of them didn't appear together. He remained absent on 23nd because he knew he would be confronted with the Kochhars."
 He argued that the CBI lost crucial days of Kochhar's custody because Dhoot didn't turn up even on December 25, 2022. CBI submitted they complied with Section 41A of the CrPC and that Dhoot's release would jeopardize the probe.
 Moreover, Dhoot had no cash flow when seeking ₹300 crore loan from ICICI bank, the court was told.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently observed that while considering a case for charge or discharge of an accused, the court is not required to enter into deeper appreciation of the facts.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently observed that while considering a case for charge or discharge of an accused, the court is not required to enter into deeper appreciation of the facts. 
The observation came from Justice Sanjay Dhar:
 "It is a settled law that while considering the case for charge or discharge of an accused, the court is not required to enter into deeper appreciation of the facts. The evidence and the material available before the trial court is not to be scanned and evaluated in the manner as if the court has to find whether the accused has committed the offence or he is innocent. At the stage of framing of charge, the court has only to consider the material for framing opinion as to whether prima facie offence is committed which would require the accused to be put on trial. A strong suspicion is enough to suggest commission of offence by an accused. At the stage of framing of charge, the court has to merely sift the evidence in order to find out whether or not there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against the accused. A meticulous examination of the record, in order to find whether the accused can be held guilty on the basis of the said material, is not to be undertaken."
 Two petitions were filed challenging an order of Additional Sessions Judge, whereby charges for offences under Section 8/20/29 of NDPS Act were framed against the petitioner and seeking bail in the case.
 The petitioner challenged the impugned order of framing of charge on the ground that the only material connecting the petitioner with the alleged crime is the confessional statement of co-accused Suresh Kumar, which is not admissible in evidence.
 The Court noted that there is no quarrel with the proposition of law that a confessional statement of an accused is not admissible in evidence against a co-accused. However, an exception to this rule is "disclosure statement". Thus, if the statement of co-accused leads to "discovery" of incriminating material, the statement to that extent becomes relevant.
In the instant case, the co-accused had stated that he obtained the delivery of recovered charas from some person at the behest of the petitioner and that he has concealed the said charas at a particular place inside his truck. Pursuant to the aforesaid disclosure, the charas has been recovered from that particular place.
"In this background the Court observed, a confessional statement made by an accused in the custody of police which leads to discovery of a fact is admissible in evidence. Thus, the statement of the co-accused Suresh Kumar, to the extent it relates to the recovery of charas that had been concealed inside the truck, is definitely admissible in evidence. There is also material on record which substantiates the fact that the petitioner happens to be the owner of the truck in question."
It added,
"there is sufficient material on record of the challan to connect the petitioner with the alleged crime. The trial court was, therefore, justified in framing the charge against the petitioner and putting him to trial. The jurisdiction of this court to interfere with an order of framing of charge is very limited and in the absence of any grave illegality or perversity in the order framing charge against the petitioner, this Court would be reluctant to interfere with the said order."
 It also rejected the bail plea while observing that the petitioner was prima facie found to be involved in the conspiracy relating to possession of commercial quantity of contraband and therefore, the rigour of Section 37 of the NDPS Act would get attracted.
 Case Title : MASHOOQ AHMAD BEIGH v UNION TERRITORY OF J&K & ORS

A Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court has ruled that only such erroneous actions of Returning Officer, which would have the effect of interfering in the free flow of the election process, are amenable to scrutiny under writ jurisdiction of Courts.

A Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court has ruled that only such erroneous actions of Returning Officer, which would have the effect of interfering in the free flow of the election process, are amenable to scrutiny under writ jurisdiction of Courts.
 A Bench of Chief Justice Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan and Justice Aniruddha Roy said,
 "possible erroneous actions of Returning Officer which could be considered as amenable to correction in the writ jurisdiction are only such errors which would have the effect of interfering in the free flow of the scheduled election or hinder the progress of the election."
 Relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Manda Jaganath v. KS Rathnam & Ors., (2004) 7 SCC 492, the Bench further said,
 "if by an erroneous order, conduct of the election is not hindered, then the courts under Article 226 of the Constitution should not interfere with the orders of the Returning Officer, remedy for which lies in an Election Petition only."
 Background
 In the instant case, the Division Bench was hearing an appeal filed by the Chief Election Commissioner, against an order of the Single Judge of the High Court— allegedly interfering with the "noting of defects" on a candidate's nomination for the upcoming Bengal elections.
 The ground for challenge was that a writ petition was not maintainable in electoral matters, in view of the bar imposed under Article 329(b) of the Constitution of India. The provision states that no election to either the Parliament or to the State Legislature shall be called in question except by an "election petition".
 The EC also contended that the order impugned was issued without notice to the statutory authorities under the Representation of Peoples Act, including the Returning Officer.
 Findings
 The Court noted that the impugned order was passed while the nomination papers of the candidate were at the scrutiny stage.
 It noted that Section 36 of the RP Act provides for Scrutiny of nominations. It enables the Returning Officer to examine the nomination papers and decide all objections which may be made to any nomination.
 Sub-clause 4 thereof cautions that the Returning Officer shall not reject any nomination paper on the ground of any defect, which is not of a "substantial character".
 The Court further explained that the result of such scrutiny under Section 34, is available for adjudication by the Court only in terms of Section 100 (1)(c) of the RP Act which makes "improper rejection" of nomination as a ground to declare the election to be void.
 In the backdrop of such legislative framework, the Bench opined,
 "Trying to draw a line between the phrase 'improperly rejected' in Section 100(1)(c) of the RP Act and the rejection of 4 nomination paper on the ground of any defect which is not of a "substantial character" as occurring in Section 36(4) of the RP Act, it would be so thin that it always swings in favour of having that issue open for consideration in the Election Petition."
 This is because, the Court said,
 "any rejection of the nomination paper by the returning officer on the ground of any defect and the question whether such defect is of a 'substantial character' or not, as well as the question whether such rejection amounts to improper rejection for the purpose of Section 100(1)(c) of the RP Act are essentially mixed questions of facts and law."
 Case Title: Chief Election Commissioner & Ors. v. Ujjwal Kumar & Anr.
 Read Order

The Allahabad High Court has reiterated that a person against whom a warrant has been issued and, is absconding or concealing himself in order to avoid execution of warrants and proceedings under Section 82 of the Code have been initiated against him, is not entitled to the relief of anticipatory bail.
 The bench of Justice Manju Rani Chauhan observed thus while denying anticipatory bail to three persons (father-in-law, mother-in-law, and wife of the deceased) accused of abetting the suicide of a man.
 The Court denied them the relief of anticipatory bail after noting that the applicants/accused were not available for interrogation and investigation and the proceedings under Section 82 CrPC have been initiated against them and non-bailable warrants issued against them.
 To reach to this conclusion, the Court relied upon Apex Court’s rulings in the case of Sadhna Chaudhary Vs. State of Rajasthan & Anr., reported in 2022 (237) AIC 205 (SC) and Prem Shankar Prasad vs. The State of Bihar and another LL 2021 SC 579.
 The case in brief
 The case was registered against the applicants accused last year accusing them of torturing the deceased physically, mentally and economically and abetting him to commit suicide, due to which, the deceased committed suicide on June 16, 2022, by jumping from the Yamuna Bridge.
 After being booked under Section 306 IPC, they moved to the High Court seeking anticipatory bail on the ground that they have been falsely implicated in the case due to ulterior motives.
 In fact, it was submitted that applicant no. 3 (wife of the deceased) was being tortured by the family of the deceased in connection with their demand for dowry, and she was forced to leave her matrimonial house.
 It was further argued that there is no credible evidence against the applicants to show that there is abetment from the side of the applicants instigating the deceased to commit suicide. 
 On the other hand, the A.G.A. as well as counsel for the informant argued that the Investigating Officer has checked the call details of the deceased Akash, collected the suicide note, recorded the statements of the independent witness, which go to show the involvement of the applicants in the present case. 
 It was also submitted that from the suicide note, it is clear that applicants no.1 &2 have been held responsible for harassing the deceased to such an extent that they did not permit the deceased to meet his child, which amounts to abetment. 
 Lastly, it was submitted as per the report of S.S.P., Prayagraj, the court below has issued Non-bailable Warrants and initiated the proceedings under Section 82 Cr.P.C. against the applicants, which goes to show that the applicants are not cooperating in the and thus, they should not be granted bail.
 Taking into account the submissions of the Counsels for both the parties and the law laid down by the Supreme Court, the Court refused to grant them anticipatory bail by observing thus:
 “…looking to the facts and circumstances of this case, submissions of learned counsel for the parties, taking into consideration the role assigned to the applicant as per prosecution case, gravity and nature of accusation as well as reasons mentioned above, this court is of the view that no case for exercising its discretionary power under section 438 Code of Criminal Procedure is made out in favour of applicant”

 Case title - Anand Shankar Pandey And 2 Others vs. State Of U.P And Another [CRIMINAL MISC ANTICIPATORY BAIL APPLICATION U/S 438 CR.P.C. No. - 8536 of 2022]

The Allahabad High Court has granted anticipatory bail to former Union minister Chinmayanand Saraswati in connection with the Shahjahanpur Rape Case 2011 after the state did not oppose his bail plea. In fact, the Counsel for the complainant filed a counter affidavit stating that the complainant has no objection, whatsoever, if Chinmayanand is enlarged on anticipatory bail. #JustIn | Chinmayanand Saraswati Granted Anticipatory Bail by the #AllahabadHighCourt in the Shahjahanpur Rape Case 2011 pic.twitter.com/nCFxzl4JQZ— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) February 6, 2023
 Taking into account the stand of the complainant and state, the bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh went ahead to grant him anticipatory bail by confirming its earlier order of December 19, 2022, wherein he was granted interim anticipatory bail till February 6. It may be recalled that while granting him interim anticipatory bail on December 19, the Court had issued notices to the victim and the State government to file a reply in this matter within four weeks. Senior Advocate Anoop Trivedi appeared for Saraswati. Pursuant to Court’s order, the Complainant filed an affidavit stating that she has no objection if he is granted anticipatory bail. Significantly, the complainant has also informed the Court that she had no objection even if the state decides to withdraw from prosecution as she has no interest in further prosecuting the aforesaid case. On the other hand, the state counsels also submitted that the state itself had taken a decision to withdraw from prosecution and had granted permission to the Public Prosecutor to move an application under Section 321 Cr.P.C. (which was rejected by the trial court and later on, the order of the trial court was upheld by the HC) and, therefore, it was further submitted that the State is not opposing to grant the anticipatory bail to the accused-applicant. In view of these submissions, the Court granted him the relief
 The case against Saraswati
 It may be noted that Chinmayanand was booked in this case after a woman who had spent 11 years at his ashram accused him of committing rape against her. The Police have already filed a chargesheet in the case under IPC sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation). As per the allegations leveled by the complainant/victim in this case, Saraswati established a physical relationship with her perforce, administering some intoxicants in her food and thereafter brutally ravishing her. Allegedly, Swami also took obscene audio-visual videos and porn photographs, and during this process, she was impregnated twice and for the first time at Bareilly and for the second time at Lucknow, she was got aborted. Not only this, when she was pregnant, she was assaulted mercilessly by the applicant's goons. Earlier, on September 30, the Allahabad High Court had upheld the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Shahjahanpur refusing to allow the state government's application seeking withdrawal of the rape case against former Union minister Chinmayanand Saraswati. The Court had also asked him to surrender before the trial court by October 30, this period was extended till November 30 by the Supreme Court. Now moving to the High Court, his counsel argued that since the applicant was given a protective order during the period of investigation, now, he may be granted anticipatory bail till the conclusion of the trial as he is an old and infirm person aged about 75 years having several sicknesses. It was also argued that though he was given time till November 30 to surrender and apply for bail, however, the same would not in any manner restrict him and bind him for not exploring his remedy available under law under Section 438 Cr.P.C. for anticipatory bail. Taking into account the submissions of the counsels for both parties, the Court granted him relief till February 6. 
"Such powers are to be exercised sparingly, with circumspection, and in exceptional cases."The Supreme Court observed that the inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC can be exercised by a High Court to direct further investigation or even reinvestigation in an appropriate case."The provisions of Section 173(8) CrPC do not limit or affect such powers of the High Court to pass an order under Section 482 CrPC for further investigation or reinvestigation, if the High Court is...
The Supreme Court observed that the inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC can be exercised by a High Court to direct further investigation or even reinvestigation in an appropriate case.
"The provisions of Section 173(8) CrPC do not limit or affect such powers of the High Court to pass an order under Section 482 CrPC for further investigation or reinvestigation, if the High Court is satisfied that such a course is necessary to secure the ends of justice.". the bench of Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Aniruddha Bose observed. 
The court added that such powers are to be exercised sparingly, with circumspection, and in exceptional cases.
In this case, while disposing a petition filed under Section 482 CrPC, the High Court directed the Magistrate to give directions to the police to further investigate the case in terms of Section 173(8) CrPC regarding the allegations against the District Manager of the Bihar State Food and Civil Supplies Corporation and to seek the report within a period of three months. 
In appeal before the Apex Court, the appellant raised the following issue : Whether the High Court, in the exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC, was justified in issuing directions to the Magistrate to order further investigation though, the Magistrate before whom the charge-sheet had been filed and who had taken cognizance, did not adopt any such process?
The court noted that where the Magistrate is of the opinion that the result of investigation in the form of report filed before him is not satisfactory, he may also order investigation in terms of Sections 156(3) and/or 173(8) CrPC or he may straightway take cognizance under Section 190(1)(c) CrPC. Referring to various judgments on this aspect, the bench summarized as follows:
(a) The scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is to ensure a fair trial and that would commence only after a fair and just investigation. The ultimate aim of every investigation and inquiry, whether by the police or by the Magistrate, is to ensure that the actual perpetrators of the crime are correctly booked and the innocents are not arraigned to stand trial.(b) The powers of the Magistrate to ensure proper investigation in terms of Section 156 CrPC have been recognised, which, in turn, include the power to order further investigation in terms of Section 173(8) CrPC after receiving the report of investigation. Whether further investigation should or should not be ordered is within the discretion of the Magistrate, which is to be exercised on the facts of each case and in accordance with law.(c) Even when the basic power to direct further investigation in a case where a charge-sheet has been filed is with the Magistrate, and is to be exercised subject to the limitations of Section 173(8) CrPC, in an appropriate case, where the High Court feels that the investigation is not in the proper direction and to do complete justice where the facts of the case so demand, the inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC could be exercised to direct further investigation or even reinvestigation. The provisions of Section 173(8) CrPC do not limit or affect such powers of the High Court to pass an order under Section 482 CrPC for further investigation or reinvestigation, if the High Court is satisfied that such a course is necessary to secure the ends of justice.(d) Even when the wide powers of the High Court in terms of Section 482 CrPC are recognised for ordering further investigation or reinvestigation, such powers are to be exercised sparingly, with circumspection, and in exceptional cases. (e) The powers under Section 482 CrPC are not unlimited or untrammelled and are essentially for the purpose of real and substantial justice. While exercising such powers, the High Court cannot issue directions so as to be impinging upon the power and jurisdiction of other authorities. For example, the High Court cannot issue directions to the State to take advice of the State Public Prosecutor as to under what provision of law a person is to be charged and tried when ordering further investigation or reinvestigation; and it cannot issue directions to investigate the case only from a particular angle. In exercise of such inherent powers in extraordinary circumstances, the High Court cannot specifically direct that as a result of further investigation or reinvestigation, a particular person has to be prosecuted.
The court, taking note of the facts of the case, said that it is satisfied that the present one had been such a case of exceptional and special features where the High Court was justified in ordering further investigation, particularly qua the role of the appellant. It observed:
"We are of the view that in the given set of facts and circumstances, though the High Court has rightly exercised its powers under Section 482 CrPC for directing further investigation but, has not been justified in making such observations, comments, and remarks, which leave little scope for an independent investigation and which carry all the potential to cause prejudice to the appellant."
Another issue raised was whether the High Court was justified in passing the order impugned without affording an opportunity of hearing to the appellant? The court said that the question of opportunity of hearing in such matters would always depend upon the given set of facts and circumstances of the case. Referring to Popular Muthiah v. State: (2006) 7 SCC 296, the bench said:
"In Popular Muthiah (supra), of course, this Court held that the said appellant against whom the High Court was issuing directions for investigation should have been given an opportunity of hearing but, that had been the observation in the unique and peculiar circumstances of the case where the crime in question had already gone through one round of trial, with one person having been tried and convicted. Moreover, while disapproving unwarranted directions of the High Court as regards prosecution of the appellant, this Court also indicated that the High Court ought to have considered if any purpose would be served by its directions. It cannot be said that in Popular Muthiah, this Court has laid down a rule of universal application that in every such case of exercise of powers under Section 482 CrPC for ordering further investigation (which are even otherwise to be invoked sparingly and in exceptional cases), the Court is obliged to extend an opportunity of hearing to the person whose actions/omissions are to be investigated. In our view, the question of opportunity of hearing in such matters would always depend upon the given set of facts and circumstances of the case"

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 ; Sections 482 and 173(8) - In an appropriate case, where the High Court feels that the investigation is not in the proper direction and to do complete justice where the facts of the case so demand, the inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC could be exercised to direct further investigation or even reinvestigation - The provisions of Section 173(8) CrPC do not limit or affect such powers of the High Court to pass an order under Section 482 CrPC for further investigation or reinvestigation, if the High Court is satisfied that such a course is necessary to secure the ends of justice - The question of opportunity of hearing in such matters would always depend upon the given set of facts and circumstances of the case - While exercising such powers, the High Court cannot issue directions so as to be impinging upon the power and jurisdiction of other authorities. For example, the High Court cannot issue directions to the State to take advice of the State Public Prosecutor as to under what provision of law a person is to be charged and tried when ordering further investigation or reinvestigation; and it cannot issue directions to investigate the case only from a particular angle. In exercise of such inherent powers in extraordinary circumstances, the High Court cannot specifically direct that as a result of further investigation or reinvestigation, a particular person has to be prosecuted. (Para 13, 18)
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 ; Section 173(8), 156(3), 190(1)(c) - Where the Magistrate is of the opinion that the result of investigation in the form of report filed before him is not satisfactory, he may also order investigation in terms of Sections 156(3) and/or 173(8) CrPC or he may straightway take cognizance under Section 190(1)(c) CrPC. (Para 11.2)

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that conditions imposed by the court Section 439(1)(a) CrPC while granting bail cannot by any stretch of imagination be construed to mean that accused person is in custody so as to claim the computation of such period in reckoning the period of 180 days of detention to acquire the statutory right of default bail under proviso...
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that conditions imposed by the court Section 439(1)(a) CrPC while granting bail cannot by any stretch of imagination be construed to mean that accused person is in custody so as to claim the computation of such period in reckoning the period of 180 days of detention to acquire the statutory right of default bail under proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 167 CrPC read with Section 36A(4) of the NDPS Act.
The observations were made by a bench of Justice Sanjay Dhar while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had challenged the order passed by Principal Sessions Judge, Srinagar, whereby the petitioner's application for grant of default bail had been dismissed.
The primary ground on which the petitioner challenged his bail rejection by the District Judge Srinagar was that the period during which he was released on interim bail should be treated as period under custody for the purpose of counting the total period for which the petitioner had been in custody, whereafter his plea for grant of default bail should be considered. The petitioner further contended that the Sessions Judge had fallen into an error by excluding the period during which the petitioner was released on interim bail.
The petitioner argued that the custody of an accused released on bail is deemed to be the custody of the Court and, as such, the whole period, without excluding the period during which the petitioner was on interim bail has to be taken into account while considering his application for grant of default bail. 
Perusal of the record revealed the petitioner had moved an application for grant of default bail before the Principal Sessions Judge, Srinagar, on 04.08.2021, contending therein that the investigating agency had failed to produce the charge sheet against him despite lapse of 180 days and, as such, he 
is entitled to compulsive bail. Record further revealed that the Sessions Judge, after considering the matter came to the conclusion that even though the charge sheet was not produced by the investigating agency within the stipulated period of 180 days from the date of arrest of the petitioner, yet because the petitioner was on interim bail with effect from 24.05.2021 to 08.07.2021, as such, after excluding the said period, the petitioner had been in custody only for 140 days, thus was not entitled to grant of default bail. It was this order which was being impugned by the petitioner before the bench. 
Deciding the matter in controversy Justice Dhar observed that a Court while exercising the discretion of granting bail even for a limited period imposes conditions under Section 439(1)(a), then an accused is released from custody on execution of bonds but imposition of such conditions cannot by any stretch of imagination be construed to mean that an accused person is in custody.
"By imposition of such conditions, the physical custody of the accused does not vest with the Court as his movement is not in any way restricted. It cannot be stated that he was in physical custody of the Court so as to claim the computation of such period in reckoning the period of 180 days of detention to acquire the statutory right under proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 167 Cr. P. C read with Section 36A(4) of the NDPS Act", Justice Dhar explained.
Expounding further the bench also placed reliance on a Judgement of the Supreme Court in Gautam Navlakha vs. National Investigation Agency, 2021 wherein SC observed, 
"Broken periods of custody have to be counted while computing the total period of custody undergone by an accused for the purpose of considering his default bail plea, which in other words means that the period during which an accused has not been in custody or has been enlarged on bail cannot be computed while  calculating the period of custody for the purposes of considering the default bail plea".
 While dismissing the petition the bench upheld the order of bail rejection by the Principal District and Sessions Judge Srinagar and thereby maintained the petitioner in the instant case cannot be treated to be in detention or custody for the period he was released on temporary bail.
Case Title : Amir Hassan Mir Vs UT of J&K 

The Allahabad High Court has observed that a person who has already been granted regular bail under Section 439 of CrPC and if it found that he has not misused the liberty, then he may be granted anticipatory bail under Section 438 of CrPC in connection with added sections related to the same crime.
With this, the bench of Justice Krishan Pahal granted anticipatory bail to one Shahzad in connection with the offence under Section 3/7 of The Essential Commodities Act.
Essentially, he was earlier granted bail by the Sessions Judge, Saharanpur in February 2022 under Sections 379, 427 IPC, Sections 15, 16 of The Petroleum and Minerals Pipeline (Acquisition of Users in Land) Act, Section 3/4 of the Exclusive Substances Act and 3/4 of The Prevention of Damages to Public Property Act. 
In that very matter, after the investigation, a final report was submitted in the added Sections 3/7 of the Essential Commodities Act. Therefore, seeking anticipatory bail in those sections as well, he moved to the High Court.
His Counsel argued that the abovementioned sections were added just to frustrate the case of the applicant, so that he may be sent behind the bars. It was also argued that once the applicant had been admitted to regular bail, there was nothing on record to suggest that he had misused it or he had committed any other offence.
In this regard, the Apex Court's judgments in the case of Bhadresh Bipinbhai Sheth vs. State of Gujarat & Another 2016 (1) SCC (Cri) 240 and Manoj Suresh Jadhav & Ors. vs. The State of Maharashtra, 2018 SCC OnLine SC 3428 were also referred to, wherein the applicants therein were enlarged on anticipatory bail in the added sections after being enlarged on regular bail
Taking into account the case and arguments advanced, the Court noted that it was true that the applicant was enlarged on bail in the said F.I.R. and he has not misused it during the investigation and no apprehension of tampering with evidence had been raised by the A.G.A, therefore, the Court opined that sending him behind bars again in the added sections would be of no fruitful use.
Consequently, the applicant was found to be entitled to be enlarged on anticipatory bail, and thus, the anticipatory bail application was allowed and it was ordered that the applicant be released forthwith in the crime on anticipatory bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned.
Case title - Shahzad v. State of U.P. [CRIMINAL MISC ANTICIPATORY BAIL APPLICATION US 438 CR.P.C. No. - 9391 of 2022]

Emphasizing on the need to revise the pay structure for the judicial officers, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered for implementation of the enhanced pay scale as recommended by the Second National Judicial Pay Commission with effect from January 1, 2016.
 The bench of Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, Justices Krishna Murari and Hima Kohli also directed the Center and the States to pay the arrears to the officers in 3 instalments - 25% in 3 months, another 25% in next 3 months and balance by June 30, 2023.
 The Top Court also observed that it was imperative for revision of pay structure immediately since judicial officers were not covered by the Pay Commission constituted by the State and centre.
 "As a matter of fact, scales of pay of government servants are raised in some states once in 5 years and once in 10 years in central govt. Judicial officers are not covered by pay commission constituted by state and centre. Therefore there's an imperative need to revise pay structure immediately," the bench said in its order.
 The directions were issued by the Top Court while considering a plea by All India Judges Association for constitution of All India Judicial Commission to review the service conditions of the judges of the district judiciary. On January 6, 2022 the Court had said that the two issues which were pending for consideration related to Pay Scales to the subordinate Judiciary and the other relating to pensionary/retiral benefits.
The Second National Judicial Pay Commission was constituted by the Apex Court in 2017 for reviewing the pay scale and other conditions of Judicial Officers belonging to the subordinate judiciary all over the country. The Bench comprising Justices J Chelameswar and Abdul Nazeer had appointed former Supreme Court Judge Justice PV Reddy as commission Chairman and former Kerala High Court Judge and Senior Supreme Court lawyer R.Basant as member.
Court room exchange
In the hearing today, amicus curiae and Advocate K Parameshwar submitted that as per the recommendations of the Second National Judicial Pay Commission,the judges were entitled to a revised pay scale. He further termed the refusal of states to pay the revised pay to the officers on the ground of lack of funds as "unjust". He also added that earlier the Top Court had appointed a committee headed by Justice E Padhmanabhan for determining the pay scales of all the Judicial Officers working and retired throughout the country which had recommended the revision.
 "This objection of all the states that they don't have money to pay to the judicial officers is unjust," the counsel further submitted while arguing that the Court had granted an interim relief by directing to pay the extent of 30% of increase in basic pay with accrued increments to all categories/ranks of Judicial Officers.
 Considering amicus submissions, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, expressed his inclination for implementation of the revised pay scale since 2016.
 "We're not going to wait endlessly and it's 6.5 years of delay. Since 2016 they're waiting. As far as pay scale is concerned, we are implementing" the CJI remarked.
The order dictated by the bench stated as follows :
"We are of the view that the revision of pay structure indicated in Table 1 shall be accepted....The same shall be implemented with effect from 01.01.2016. Judicial officers have been provided interim relief of 30%. Therefore, the arrears shall be computed by adjusting the interim relief and the balance of 25% be paid in cash within a period of 3 months and another within a period of another 3 months, balance 50% to be paid in the first quarter of 2023"

Subordinate judiciary - Supreme Court directs pay hike for subordinate judiciary as per the recommendations of the Second National Judicial Pay Commission w.e.f January 1, 2016-

The Bombay High Court recently directed the Commissioner of Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) to take a final decision regarding grant of permission for construction of a Floating Hotel (Floatel) anchoring off the Raj Bhavan.
“We further direct that the Commissioner of Municipal Corporation shall take his final decision in the matter in accordance with law within a period of four weeks from the date of his decision having exclusive jurisdiction or receipt of recommendations from the Three Member Committee, as the case may be”, the court said.
The court directed the Commissioner to first decide whether he has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the matter or whether recommendations from the three-member committee formed by the High Court are required. 
The Commissioner has to decide the NOC application within four weeks from the date of his decision regarding jurisdiction and within eight weeks from the date of submission of all relevant papers and representation by the petitioner company.
The division bench of Justice Sunil B. Shukre and Justice M. W. Chandwani also set aside the three-member committee’s 2017 order denying permission to construct the floating hotel and related infrastructure.
The three-member committee was constituted via the High Court’s order on August 6, 2015, in a PIL Vinay Mulchand Yadav v. State of Maharashtra. The MCGM has to permit, prohibit or regulate any activity at Marine Drive depending upon the committee’s recommendation.
The petitioner sought permission to construct a Floating Hotel two nautical miles into the sea. Permission was also sought for construction of a waiting area and floating jetty near the National Centre for Performing Arts. The petitioner said that it will implement the project on the basis of an MoU with MTDC.
The committee consisting of the Chairman of the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee, the Police Commissioner, Mumbai and the MCGM Commissioner denied the permission. Bombay HC in 2018 upheld this decision observing that the infrastructure would be an extension of the Marine Drive Promenade. However, last year, the Apex Court set aside the HC’s decision and sent the matter back for fresh consideration.
In the second round, the court agreed with the petitioner’s contention that none of the proposed structures form part of the Marine Drive Promenade. The court noted that the starting point of the floating jetty does not form part of the promenade and the proposed waiting area is on a piece of land not on the Promenade. Further, the parking area has been allotted by the MMRDA and is not part of the Promenade.
Thus, the court stated that the MCGM Commissioner has to first decide whether he has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the petitioner’s NOC application. “…if he decides that he has such jurisdiction in the matter, he would have to go ahead to consider the application of the petitioner on its own merits, without being influenced by the order passed by this Court and also order passed by the Three Member Committee on 24th May 2017”, the court added. 
However, if the Commissioner concludes that he has no exclusive rejection then he would have to refer the matter to the three-member committee and act on its recommendation, the court said. The recording of finding on jurisdiction is important as it does to the root of the dispute in the case, the court held.
The court also set aside the order of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone-1, rejecting the NOC application. That order was based on the objection by the Senior Police Inspector, Marine Drive Police Station and the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Colaba division. The court said that neither of these authorities have any jurisdiction in the matter and the police authorities having jurisdiction have already given the green signal. 
“The authority which is having jurisdiction in the matter, i.e. Deputy Commissioner of Police, Mumbai had already granted permission for the subject project vide its communication dated 13th April 2011. There is another communication dated 9th June 2016 of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Head Office-1, MCGM granting permission for implementing the Floatel project and carrying out incidental activities. This permission, granted on 9th June 2016, would in particular, nullify the subsequent objection taken by the subordinate officer of the Commissioner of Mumbai Police”, the court held.

Deciding a civil revision against the order of a civil court, the Madhya Pradesh High Court has held that rejecting an application preferred under Order VII Rule 11 CPC would be illegal if the court sought for written statements of the defendant rather than deciding the same on averments in the plaint.
 Justice Anil Verma observed,
"For the purposes of deciding an application under clauses (a) and (d) of Rule 11 of Order VII C.P.C. the averments in the plaint are germane; the pleas taken by the defendant in the written statement would be wholly irrelevant at that stage, therefore, a direction to file the written statement without deciding the application under Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. cannot but be procedural irregularity touching the exercise of jurisdiction by the trial court."
The Court was essentially dealing with a civil revision challenging the order of a civil court, wherein the application of the Petitioner/Defendant under Order VII Rule 11 CPC was rejected on the ground that his contentions would be adjudicated based on his pleadings and the evidence produced by all the parties.
 The case of the Petitioner/Defendant was that the Respondent/Plaintiff had filed a suit for declaration and cancellation of sale deeds, along with possession of suit land. After the service of notice upon the Petitioners/Defendants, they sought for rejection of plaint under Order VII Rule 11. They submitted before the civil court that the said land dispute falls under the provisions of Section 170-B and Section 257 of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code, 1959, which categorically bar the civil court from exercising its jurisdiction in the matter. 
However, the civil judge rejected the application and hence, revision was filed.
 The Respondent/Plaintiff argued that that the suit was not covered under section 257 of the MPLRC, therefore, the Civil Court had jurisdiction to entertain the matter. Hence, the revision petition had no merit and was liable to be dismissed.
 Examining the grounds taken by the lower court while rejecting the application, the court elucidated the aspects of provisions under Order VII Rule 11. It noted that –
 A perusal of Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. makes it clear that the relevant facts which need to be looked into for deciding an application thereunder are the averments in the plaint. The trial court can exercise the power under Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. at any stage of the suit-before registering the plaint or after issuing summons to the defendant at any time before the conclusion of the trial. For the purposes of deciding an application under clauses (a) and (d) of Rule 11 of Order VII C.P.C. the averments in the plaint are germane; the pleas taken by the defendant in the written statement would be wholly irrelevant at that stage, therefore, a direction to file the written statement without deciding the application under Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. cannot but be procedural irregularity touching the exercise of jurisdiction by the trial court.
 The court placed its reliance on Sapan Sukhdeo Sable & Ors. v. Assistant Charity Commissioner & Ors., wherein the Supreme Court had noted that Order VII Rule 11 casts a duty on the court to perform its obligations in rejecting the plaint when the same is hit by any of the infirmities provided in the four clauses of Rule 11, even without intervention of the defendant. The court also referred to Sajjan Sikaria & Ors. v. Shakuntala Devi Mishra & Ors., wherein the Apex court had observed that while dealing with an application under Order VII Rule 11, consideration of written statement is not a condition precedent and only averments in the plaint have to be considered.
 Collating its observations, the court concluded that the lower court had acted illegally in exercise of its power because for the purpose of deciding the application under Order VII Rule 11, the averments in the plaint alone should've been germane as the pleas to be taken by the defendant in the written statement were wholly irrelevant. Wherefore, the impugned order passed by the civil court, being contrary to law, was liable to be set aside.
 The court while remitting the matter to the lower court, directed that the application filed by the Petitioner/Defendant under Order VII Rule 11 be decided on the basis of the averments in the plaint after affording an opportunity of being heard to the parties, in accordance with law.
 Petitioner was represented by Senior Advocate V.K. Jain with Mr. Vaibhav Jain.
 Respondent was represented by Senior Advocate A.S. Garg with Ms. Nidhi Bohra.
 State was represented by Mr. Amay Bajaj.
 Case Title: Foti Rakabchand Jain through LRs Vs. Foti Ratanlal Jain through LRs Case citation:  (MP) 8

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently reiterated that there cannot be two FIRs with regard to the same occurrence but in cases of two different versions on part of rival parties with regard to the same occurrence, registration of cross FIRs is permissible.
 The observations were made by Justice Rajnesh Oswal while hearing a plea challenging an order passed by Judicial Magistrate Kishtwar observing that there cannot be two FIRs for the same cause/occurrence except counter FIRs and the grievance of the petitioner by no stretch of imagination is justified as the FIR is already in place and investigation is going on.
 The petitioner had filed an application under section 156(3) CrPC for registration of FIR under sections 323, 341, 420, 409, 452, 506 and 109 IPC read with section 3/25 Arms Act against the respondent Nos. 3 to 6 before the Court of Duty Magistrate, Kishtwar. After recording his satisfaction that the complaint reveals the commission of cognizable offences, the Magistrate forwarded the complaint under section 156(3) Cr.P.C. to SHO, Kishtwar to register the FIR under relevant provisions of law.
 Non compliance on part of concerned SHO constrained the petitioner to file an application for initiation of contempt proceedings against the SHO Police Station, Kishtwar.
 The Magistrate while issuing notice to the respondent SHO as a response to which a status report came to be filed by him stating that one FIR stands already registered prior to the filing of the complaint by the petitioner under section 156(3) Cr.P.C. and in the said FIR, the son of the petitioner-complainant was named as an accused.
 In view of this fact the Magistrate dropped the contempt proceedings with the observations that there cannot be two FIRs for the same cause/occurrence except counter FIRs and the grievance of the petitioner by no stretch of imagination is justified as the FIR is already in place and investigation is going on. It was this order which was being impugned before the bench.
 Challenging the order the petitioner submitted that the Magistrate has failed to appreciate that the allegations levelled in the complaint and the FIR are entirely different.
 Petitioner further submitted that once the Magistrate had ordered the registration of FIR after recording its satisfaction with regard to the commission of cognizable offences, then the course adopted by the learned Magistrate by observing that with regard to the same occurrence, two FIRs are not permissible, is not in accordance with law particularly when the allegations levelled by the petitioner were different.
 After hearing the contentions the court noted that in the instant case, record reveals that 
 pursuant to the complaint filed by respondent No. 5, FIR bearing No. 11/2021 for commission of offences under sections 447, 147 and 323 IPC has been registered against the five accused including the son and wife of the petitioner after they allegedly and illegally trespassed in the land of respondent No. 5 and assaulted him as well as his wife and the time of occurrence of the incident had been shown as 0830 hours.
 Court also noted that on the contrary, in the complaint filed by the petitioner it has been alleged that the respondent Nos. 5 and 6 on 10.01.2021 at 6.00 a.m. armed with sharp edged weapons i.e. axe forcefully trespassed into the land of the petitioner and started cutting trees and binding wire fence on the disputed land. The respondent Nos. 5 and 6 started shouting by using filthy and unparliamentary language and caught hold of his son and started beating him mercilessly, the petitioner-complaint had stated in his complaint.
 There may be one version of the complainant and the other by the accused and in such type of situation, the registration of cross FIR is permissible, the court said, adding that the course adopted by the Magistrate while dropping the contempt proceedings with the observation that FIR is already in place and investigation is going on, is not correct.
 "It cannot be said that in the instant case, the registration of FIR on the application of the petitioner would amount to registration of second FIR regarding same offence. Rather this Court is of the considered view that the same would be a cross FIR and the registration of the same, is not impermissible under law", the bench underscored.
 Accordingly, the bench set aside the observations made by the Magistrate in his order directed SHO Kishtwar to register an FIR under relevant provisions of law against the respondent Nos. 5 and 6.
 Case Title: Abdul Rashid Vs UT of J&K 
 Coram: Justice Rajesh Oswal

Explaining the scope and power of the court under Section 319 CrPC, the Allahabad High Court recently observed that this provision allows the court to summon those persons who are not named in the charge sheet to appear and face trial (in certain circumstances).
The Bench of Justice Vikas Budhwar observed that the very object of engrafting section 319 Cr.P.C. is to not allow a person who deserves to be tried to go scot-free. 
It may be noted that under Section 319 CrPC, the Court has been given the power to proceed against other persons appearing to be guilty of offence in the course of any inquiry into, or trial of, an offence.
In other words, Section 319 CrPC gives power to the Trial Court to proceed against a person who has not been named in the charge sheet, if evidence of the involvement of that person emerges during the trial/inquiry.
The High Court in the instant matter underscored that once the Magistrate finds that there is sufficient material available on record before it to summon a person in the trial which is proposed to be undertaken, then the powers u/s 319 Cr.P.C. are to be invoked.
"The stage which is contemplated under section 319 Cr.P.C. 1973 is a stage before the conclusion of the trial and thus, only one conclusion can be drawn that the Magistrate must be prima facie of the opinion that there are sufficient material and cause for summoning the culprit who is either not named in the FIR or if named, he has not been charge-sheeted or discharged," the Court further said.
Essentially, the Bench was dealing with a revision plea filed by one Rameshwar and another challenging an order of the Court of Sessions Judge, Mahoba summoning the accused under section 319 crpc in connection with an offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder (punishable under Section 304 IPC)
The revisionists submitted that the entire exercise to summon them was illegal, as revisionists have not committed the offence and there was no occasion/prima facie case to issue the summons to face trial.
On the other hand, defending the order of the trial court, the A.G.A argued that from the narration of the allegation contained in the FIR vis-a-vis, the statement of PWs, the name of the revisionists have been pin pointed and further there was sufficient evidence on record to exercise power under Section 319 CrPC.
In its order, the Court noted that while engrafting section 319 Cr.P.C. the words employed were: "in the course of any inquiry into, or trial of, an offence, it appears from the evidence", which shows that the degree of satisfaction has to be accorded by the Magistrate while exercising powers u/s 319 Cr.P.C.
However, the Court noted that the degree of satisfaction defers from case to case and according to the degree of satisfaction, the test to be applied as one should be more than a prima facie case at the stage of framing of charges.
"...it can be very well said that once the Magistrate finds that there was sufficient material available on record before it to summon a person in the trial which is proposed to be undertaken thenthe powers u/s 319 Cr.P.C. are to be invoked."
Now, referring to the facts of the case, the Court noted that in the FIR lodged by the complainant (the brother of the deceased), revisionists were arrayed as accused and more so, in the statement so recorded under Sections 161 and 164 CrPC, names of the revisionists find its presence. 
The Court also observed that in the statement of PWs, the name of the revisionists has appeared and thus, the Court added, the Court was within its jurisdiction and powers to have summoned the revisionist.
"So far as the argument so sought to be raised by learned counsel for the revisionists with regard to the fact that they have not committed the offence and the confessional statement of one of the co-accused, who was though not named in the FIR, but against whom, charge sheet was submitted is a matter of defence, which will be available to the revisionists at the time, when the trial gets commence," the Court ordered as it dismissed the revision plea.

Filing of the charge-sheet by itself, does not entitle an accused to copies of any of the relevant documents including statement under Section 164 of the Code, the Supreme Court observed while setting aside the Allahabad High Court order which allowed the plea of former Union Minister and BJP leader Chinmayanand to seek a certified copy of the statement of the rape victim.
The right to receive a copy of such statement will arise only after cognizance is taken and at the stage contemplated by Sections 207 and 208 of the Code and not before, the three judge bench headed by Justice Uday Umesh Lalit held.
The court observed that the High Court 'completely erred and failed' in appreciating the directions issued in the judgment State of Karnataka vs. Shivanna alias Tarkari Shivanna, especially in a matter where the offences alleged against accused are of sexual exploitation.
The High Court in this case, had relied on Shivanna to hold that, once the investigation is over and a report is filed under section 173 of CrPC at that stage the copy of the statement under Section 164 CrPC along with other relevant documents can be asked by the concerned person. [The background facts of this can be read here] Disagreeing with this approach, the bench, also comprising Justices Vineet Saran and S. Ravindra Bhat, took note of the statutory provisions of Criminal Procedure Code and said:
"It is only after taking of the cognizance and issuance of process that the accused is entitled, in terms of Sections 207 and 208 of the Code, to copies of the documents referred to in said provisions. The filing of the charge-sheet by itself, does not entitle an accused to copies of any of the relevant documents including statement under Section 164 of the Code, unless the stages indicated above are undertaken. Thus, merely because the charge-sheet was filed by the time the High Court had passed the order in the present matter, did not entitle Respondent No.2 to a copy of the statement under Section 164 of the Code."
The court further clarified that no person is entitled to a copy of statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code till the appropriate orders are passed by the court after the charge-sheet is filed. It said:
"The right to receive a copy of such statement will arise only after cognizance is taken and at the stage contemplated by Sections 207 and 208 of the Code and not before."
"Though, a copy of the statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code was made over to the accused, we must set aside the order passed by the High Court and lay down that under no circumstances copies of statements recorded under Section 164 of the Code can be furnished till appropriate orders are passed by the Court after taking cognizance in the matter."

The Supreme Court of India has observed that where a Court while considering an application for bail fails to consider the relevant factors, an Appellate Court may justifiably set aside the order granting bail.
According to the Bench, the Appellate Court is required to consider whether the order granting bail suffers from a non­-application of mind or a prima facie view from the evidence available on record. 
A Bench comprising Justice MR Shah and Justice Sanjiv Khanna made the observation while considering an appeal challenging the Delhi High Court's order granting bail to a person accused of engaging in the business of multi­commodity trading of agricultural and non­- commodities agricultural and for the offences under Sections 409, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120B IPC. 
The Bench has held that the High Court's order is unsustainable as the High Court while releasing the accused respondent on bail has not exercised the jurisdiction judiciously and has not considered the relevant factors which are required to be considered while grant of bail.
The Bench observed that it appears that the High Court has directed to release the accused on bail mainly on the ground that the case arises out of a commercial transaction and is based on documents already seized
However, all allegations and the material collected during the course of the investigation which are part of the charge­sheet and supplementary charge­ sheet were not taken note of by the High Court. Further, the High Court has not at all taken note of the reasoning given by the the Sessions Court while rejecting the bail application of accused.
The Court has observed that the High Court has completely lost sight of the basic principles enumerated by the Supreme Court through various decisions. 
The Bench has pointed out that the High Court has not at all considered the modus operandi adopted by the accused in commission of serious offence of siphoning and/or transferring the huge sum to another company through shell companies. Further, the High Court has also not taken into consideration the status report filed by the I.O. in which in detail it has been pointed out how systematically the accused have committed the offence and misappropriated/siphoned off the huge sum through shell companies.
The Bench further observed that the High Court has not at all considered the relevant factors including the nature and gravity of accusation; the modus operandi and the manner in which the offences have been committed through shell companies and creating the false/forged documents and/or misusing the PAN Cards, Aadhar Cards and KYCs of the employees and showing them as Directors of the fake and shell companies.
The Bench relied on Supreme Court's judgement in the case of Mahipal vs. Rajesh Kumar alias Polia and Another, (2020) where it was held that though the Court does not ordinarily interfere with the order of the High Court granting bail, however, where the discretion of the High Court to grant bail has been exercised without due application of mind and in contravention of the directions of this Court, such an order of granting bail is liable to be set aside.
The Bench also relied on the case of Neeru Yadav vs. State of UP & Anr., (2016) where Supreme Court had laid down the factors to be considered by the Court while dealing with an application for grant of bail.
The Bench therefore concluded that the High Court has not adverted to the relevant considerations and has granted the bail mechanically by observing that the case arises out of a commercial transaction.
The Court has quashed and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court the respondent accused on bail deserves and directed the accused to surrender before the concerned Court/Jail Authority forthwith.

The Supreme Court observed that the Wakf Board can determine the nature of the property as wakf only after conducting inquiry as prescribed under Section 40 of the Wakf Act.
The conduct of inquiry pre-supposes compliance of the principles of natural justice so as to give opportunity of hearing to the affected parties, the bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian said.
The court allowed an appeal filed by the State challenging the action of Wakf Board and measuring 1654 acres and 32 guntas as wakf property and held that the said land vest with the state and/or Corporation free from any encumbrance. 
One of the issues that was considered was whether the power to investigate and determine the nature of property is an administrative function or is it a quasi-judicial function as an inquiry is required to be conducted before any property is declared to be Wakf property?
At the outset, the court noted that the Board is competent to collect information regarding any property which it has reason to believe to be Wakf property and if any question arises as to whether a particular property is a Wakf property or not, or whether a wakf is a sunni wakf or a shia wakf, it may, after making such inquiry as it may deem fit, decide the question.
Referring to the provisions of the Act, the court found that the power of the Board to investigate and determine the nature and extent of Wakf is not purely an administrative function. The bench observed thus: 
"145... Such power has to be read along with Section 40 of the Act which enjoins "a Wakf Board to collect information regarding any property which it has reason to believe to be wakf property and to decide the question about the nature of the property after making such inquiry as it may deem fit." The power to determine under Section 32(2)(n) is the source of power but the manner of exercising that power is contemplated under Section 40 of the 1995 Act. An inquiry is required to be conducted if a Board on the basis of information collected finds that the property in question is a wakf property. An order passed thereon is subject to appeal before the Wakf Tribunal, after an inquiry required is conducted in terms of subsection (1) of Section 40. Therefore, there cannot be any unilateral decision without recording any reason that how and why the property is included as a wakf property. The finding of the Wakf Board is final, subject to the right of appeal under sub-section (2). Thus, any decision of the Board is required to be as a reasoned order which could be tested in appeal before the Wakf Tribunal."
"146...Therefore, the Wakf Board has power to determine the nature of the property as wakf under Section 32(2)(n) but after complying with the procedure prescribed as contained in 120 Section 40. Such procedure categorically prescribes an inquiry to be conducted. The conduct of inquiry pre-supposes compliance of the principles of natural justice so as to give opportunity of hearing to the affected parties. "
The court noted that the proceedings produced by the Wakf Board do not show any inquiry conducted or any notice issued to either of the affected parties.
"Since there is no determination of the fact whether the property in question is a wakf property after conducting an inquiry in terms of Section 40(1) of the 1995 Act, the Errata notification cannot be deemed to be issued in terms of Section 32 read with Section 40 of the 1995 Act. Such determination alone could have conferred right on the affected parties to avail the remedy of appeal under Section 40 of the 1995 Act.", the court added.

The Allahabad High Court last week granted anticipatory bail to a man accused of raping his daughter-in-law as the Court noted that it is quite unnatural that a father-in-law shall commit rape of his own daughter-in-law along with some other person in our Indian culture.
"...considering that it is quite unnatural that a father-in-law shall commit rape of his own daughter-in-law along with some other person in our Indian culture, considering that the accusation has been made falsely with the object of injuring or humiliating his reputation in the society," the bench of Justice Ajit Singh observed as it extended the benefit of anticipatory bail to accused-Babu Khan (father-in-law of the victim).
Essentially, the Court was dealing with an anticipatory bail application filed on behalf of the applicant (Babu Khan) in connection with a case registered against him under sections 376, 511, 504 and 506 I.P.C.
The FIR in the case was lodged by the victim (daughter-in-law of the accused) against Khan (father-in-law) and other co-accused Mohammad Haroon. It was alleged by the victim that her father-in-law along with the co-accused came to the house of the victim's brother and asked if her brother is there in the house.
Further, when the victim said that her brother is not at home, then the father-in-law/accused started abusing her and when the victim tried to stop him, then she was pushed on the bed by him, then both the accused tried to rape her.
The Counsel for the applicant (Khan) contended that similarly placed other co-accused Mohammad Haroon had been granted anticipatory bail by the High Court and hence, he is also entitled to anticipatory bail on the ground of parity.
Against this backdrop, the Court granted him pre-arrest bail by observing thus:
"Without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case and considering the nature of accusations and the antecedents of the applicant, considering the gravity of the offence, considering that it is quite unnatural that a father-in-law shall commit rape of his own daughter-in-law along with some other person in our Indian culture, considering that the accusation has been made falsely with the object of injuring or humiliating his reputation in the society., considering the Constitution Bench judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Sushila Aggarwal vs. State (NCT of Delhi)...and in the case of Satendra Kumar Antil vs. Central Bureau of Investigation..."
He was directed to be released on anticipatory bail on his furnishing a personal bond with two sureties each in the like amount of Rs. 25,000/- to the satisfaction of the Station House Officer concerned.

The Calcutta High Court on Monday upheld the order of a Single Judge bench for a CBI probe into the death of former Congress councillor of Jhalda Municipality in Purulia, Tapan Kandu who was reportedly shot dead by miscreants on March 13.
Some motorcycle-borne persons had reportedly shot Tapan dead when he had gone for a walk near his residence. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) had also been constituted to probe the murder of Tapan Kandu with the help of the crime investigation department (CID).
A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj noted that the counsel appearing for the CBI has pointed out that the CBI has already taken over the investigation and substantial progress in the investigation has been done.
Opining that no case of interference is made out, the Court observed, 
"In view of the circumstances noted above, we do not find any error in the order of the learned Single Judge and no case of interference is made out. We make it clear that any observation made by the learned Single Judge in the order under challenge or by this Court in this order are only tentative for the purpose of deciding the present issue and they will not prejudice the trial in any manner."
The Bench further opined that the Single Judge has considered the factual and legal position while passing the impugned order and accordingly underscored, 
"We are of the opinion that the circumstances which are noted by the learned Single Judge in respect of the lapses on the part of the investigating agency, the nature and circumstances of the case and the legal position which has been taken note of, fully justify the direction which has been issued in the impugned order."
It was further noted that the Single Judge had called for two reports from the Superintendent of Police in respect of the investigation and had also perused the case diary before passing a direction for a CBI probe. The Court also took into consideration that the Single Judge has reached to the conclusion that there is need for instilling faith of the public at large in investigation that involves serious crime and having regard to the gravity and political nature of the crime and thus handed over the investigation to the CBI.
Reliance was placed on the Supreme Court decision in R.S. Sodhi, Advocate v. State of U.P. and Others wherein it had been held that if the accusation is against the local police personnel, it will be desirable in the larger interest of justice to entrust the investigation to the CBI so as to assure investigation credibility.
Justice Rajasekhar Mantha in the impugned order had ordered for a CBI probe by opining that there is a need for instilling faith of the public at large and that given the gravity and politically sensitive nature of the crime the public needs to see that the Rule of Law is still alive and functioning.
Impugned Order
Justice Rajasekhar Mantha was adjudicating upon a plea moved by the widow of the deceased Councillor seeking a CBI probe on the ground that no progress in the investigation has been made by the State investigating authorities.
Pursuant to the perusal of the case diary as well as a further status report filed by the concerned police authorities, the Court had pointed out certain aspects of the investigation that were concerning.
The Court had noted that the accused Kolebar Singh was reportedly arrested in Jharkhand and thereafter remanded in custody by the appropriate Court in Purulia, West Bengal. The Court had stated that a transit remand to this effect has been omitted in the case diary. It had also been highlighted that the photographs of the site of occurrence had been taken 2 days after the date of incident apparently after the intervention of the CID, West Bengal.
Expressing deep concern, the Court had also noted that the Inspector-In-Charge of the Jhalda Police station, Sanjib Ghosh who is set to have facilitated the crime had not yet been taken into custody. The Court had observed that it is 'surprising' that the mobile phone of Ghosh has not yet been seized and that vital data may have been lost by now.
"It also appears that the person who is stated by the complainant to have facilitated the crime, i.e., the Inspector-in-Charge of the Jhalda Police Station, Sanjib Ghosh, has not been taken into custody as yet, and is still performing his duties. It is surprising to note that the mobile phone of the said Sanjib Ghosh has not been seized till date. Vital data may have been lost", the Court had ordered.
Justice Mantha had also objected to the fact that Purulia district police superintendent, S. Selvamurugan had held a press conference where he had given a clean chit to Ghosh by stating that the murder was a result of family feud. "This has been done while the investigation is still in progress and, final report is yet to be submitted" , the Court had opined.
The Court also took cognisance of the fact that the Purulia district police superintendent, S. Selvamurugan had been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate pertaining to the investigation relating to the coal scam case. Thus, the investigation into the death of former Congress councillor of Jhalda Municipality in Purulia had been transferred to the CBI.

The Kerala High Court on Tuesday quashed an FIR registered under the Foreigners Act against two Pakistan nationals who had reached the State for medical treatment.
Noting that they had followed all the procedural formalities, Justice K Haripal allowed the writ petition preferred by the Pakistan nationals: 
"In no stretch of imagination, the act of the respondents in registering a crime against the petitioners can be justified...In my view, in fact, such an act of the second respondent has only brought ignominy to our system. The petitioners have taken extra care to follow the procedural formalities." 
The Court added:
"It is expected that when foreign nationals are involved, responsible officials would exhibit little more sensibility and act cautiously. An exception has to be taken for registering a crime at the drop of a hat. Here absolutely no reason is made out for initiating criminal prosecution against the petitioners who had reached India with valid travel documents; their arrival was duly intimated to the Special Branch and the officials of the Special Branch were monitoring them."
The City Police Commissioner was thereby directed to issue a police clearance certificate, as per law, to the petitioners within three days.
Background:
The petitioners were Pakistan nationals who had come to India for medical treatment. One of them was suffering from Cervical Spinal cord injuries for which he sought treatment from the third petitioner hospital, AAMRI Rehab International, Ernakulam. 
Accordingly, he obtained a Medical Visa for three months and flew to Kerala with his medical attendant. 
Immediately upon arrival, the matter was initiated to the Assistant Commissioner of Police of Special Branch, Ernakulam.
Thereby, the hospital informed the Special Branch of the arrival of petitioners within 24 hours. The Special Branch then asked the hospital to forward an e-mail containing the photographs of the petitioners.
After undergoing treatment, the first petitioner was discharged. They were set to fly to Chennai the next day to leave India through the Sharjah route. 
However, when they reached Chennai, they were not allowed to leave the country unless they displayed a police clearance certificate. 
So they returned to Kochi and sought a police clearance certificate. Instead of issuing the same, the police informed them that they were booked under sections 11 and 14 of the Foreigners Act.
Alleging that this was a clear case of abuse of process of law, the petitioners approached the Court.
Observations:
The Court after persuing the documents submitted agreed with the petitioners, particularly because the genuineness of the documents produced by them was not challenged. 
The Public Prosecutor had failed to make out a case on how Section 11 of the Foreigners Act would be attracted in the given facts of the case. Hence, it observed:
"I do not have the slightest doubt in my mind that Ext.P17 (FIR registered against the petitioners) is clearly an abuse of the process of law." 
It was noted that they had reached India under a valid visa issued by the Indian Embassy of Oman, and had undergone all requisite procedures under the law to stay in the State. 
Additionally, the Court noted that the first petitioner suffered from serious illness and was in an immobile condition. Such a person couldn't be expected to report to the police station physically. 
According to the Court, the only omission on part of the petitioners was their failure to make a written request for getting a police clearance certificate prior to their departure from Kochi.
It was also noted that the respondents have no case that petitioners have violated the terms of the visa or the residential permits or had caused any threat to the national security or done anything prejudice to our interests. 
Hence the Bench opined that the crime was registered without conducting a proper enquiry or doing homework by the respondents.
"It is the settled proposition of law that where the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused or where the allegations in the FIR and other materials do not disclose a cognizable offence justifying an investigation by police, the court is justified in quashing the proceedings at the threshold." 
Considering that the police was well aware of the petitioners' arrival and that they had only registered a crime upon being requested for a police clearance certificate, the Court remarked:
"I have no hesitation in holding that all the proceedings pursuant to Ext.P17 are illegal and therefore, proceedings initiated pursuant to the Ext.P17 are hereby quashed."
Senior Advocate V.J. Mathew and Advocate Vipin P. Varghese appeared for the petitioners while the respondents were represented by Senior Government Pleader Sajju S. and Additional Public Prosecutor P. Narayanan.
Case Title: Imran Muhammad & Ors v. State of Kerala & Anr.

The Karnataka High Court has quashed charges of rape levelled against an accused who was booked on the complaint made by the victim, after the accused refused to marry her on being in a relationship with her for over five years.
A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna partly allowed the petition filed by Mallikarjun Desai Goudar and quashed charges levelled under sections 376, 376(2)(n), 354, 406 and 504 of the Indian Penal Code. The court sustained the charges against him under sections 323 and 506 r/w 34 of the IPC. 
The bench while quashing the charges of rape said,
“The consent in the case at hand is not once, twice or thrice; not for days or months; but for several years, five years precisely, as is narrated in the complaint as the two were in love. Therefore, for five long years, it cannot be said that the consent of a woman has been taken for having such instances, all along against her will.” 
It added “It is the length of the relationship and the acts in such a period of such relationship between the two that takes away the rigor of ingredients of Section 375 of the IPC, for it to become an offence under Section 376 of the IPC.” 
It was alleged by the victim that the two became acquaintances and it turned into a relationship and the relationship into sexual relationship. It was alleged that on the pretext of marriage, the petitioner had sexual intercourse with her and has later breached the promise of marriage and, therefore, it was contended that consent of the complainant was obtained by inducement on false promise of marriage. 
Following which a crime came to be registered against the accused the police after investigation filed the chargesheet. 
The petitioner submitted that he and the complainant were in love, wanted to get married, but in view of caste equations not meeting, the marriage could not take place despite hectic efforts on his part. It is then the complainant turns around and brands their relationship to be on the false pretext of marriage and alleges that he had sexual intercourse on that pretext and, therefore, it amounts to rape. It was said “It would not amount to rape by any stretch of imagination as it was consensual.”
The plea was opposed by the complainant claiming that if consent is obtained by false promise or false pretext that the accused would marry the complainant, it would amount to rape, as consent is not given by free will. 
The bench on going through the complaint noted that the complaint indicates that the petitioner and the complainant were in love for 5 years and they had known each other for 12 years. 
Then it observed “The narration in the complaint and the statement under Section 164 of the Cr.P.C., if read in juxtaposition, what would unmistakably emerge is, the petitioner and the complainant were in love and have had intercourse on several occasions for years. The statement clearly records that the petitioner had made hectic efforts to get married to the complainant. The family of both the petitioner and the complainant were known to each other. Talks of marriage did take place, but failed.” 
Further it said “Though the complaint and the statement narrates that the petitioner has had sexual intercourse with the complainant, initially forcibly, but the said force cannot be seen to continue for five long years. The narration would clearly indicate that the relationship was consensual.” 
It added “If it is consensual, it cannot be alleged that it would become an ingredient of rape under Section 375 of the IPC, for it to become punishable under Section 376 of the IPC.” 
Rejecting the contention of the complainant that the consent of the petitioner is obtained on the false promise of marriage and therefore, it should be termed as a rape, the bench said “The submission is unacceptable, as the consent of a woman on a promise to marry is always an enigma.” 
Referring to the Kerala High Court judgment in the case of Ramachandra Vs State of Kerala, the bench said, “For five long years, it cannot be said that the consent of a woman has been taken for having such instances, all along against her will.” 
Accordingly it held “This Court has to step in exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., to obliterate the crime registered against the petitioner for the offence of rape under Section 376 of the IPC, failing which, it would become an abuse of the process of law.”

"The age of 15-16 years or below 18 years is not the age where any young couple should enter into the institution of marriage,
" the Allahabad High Court
 observed recently as it granted bail to a man accused of raping a minor girl taking into account the larger interest of the child born out of their consensual relationship.
The Bench of Justice 
Rajesh Singh Chauhan however clarified that the bail order 
not be cited in any other case as precedence inasmuch as the bai was granted considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the instant case.
The case in brief
Minor victim/prosecutrix 
went to Ludhiyana with the accused/bail applicant, where the accused established physical relations with her on the promise of marriage. 
Thereafter, they got married without informing their family members. 
Subsequently, the girl conceived gave birth to a male child. Thereafter, the accused was booked 
u/s 376, 506 IPC, & 5/6 of POSCO Act and is in jail since January 6, 2022. Now, seeking bail, he moved to the High Court.
Arguments advanced
Before the Court, his counsel submitted that
 presently the informant/prosecutrix is living with the family members of the applicant/accused and she does not want to go to the place of her parents.
 It was also contended that in her Section 
161 and 164 Cr.P.C. statement, she had not leveled any allegation against the present applicant and
 rather, she had stated she was willingly living with the accused.
Further, filing his 
affidavit, the father of the prosecutrix supported the case of the accused and submitted before the Court that his daughter is happily living with the family members of the accused.
On the other hand, the state's counsel submitted that since the girl was a minor, 
her consent was meaningless in the eyes of law 
and therefore, the accused 
should not be released on bail.
Court's observations 
At the very outset, the Court observed that it was pained to notice the fact that children of tender age, who have not attained the age of majority, are indulging in such type of relations which may not be said to be a proper relation. 
Further, the Court remarked thus:
"When a certain age has been prescribed by the statute to get married and live accordingly, any such act which has been committed prior to such age can not be approved. The age of 15-16 years or below 18 years is not the age where any young couple should enter into the institution of marriage."
However, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the Court noted that the accused and the prosecutrix have not only got married but they are having an infant son from said wedlock.
Further, stressing that it is the responsibility of the couple to look after their child properly, the court said that if the accused is not released from jail or if he is kept in jail, there might be a possibility that his minor wife with his son might not be taken care of properly by his parents.
Therefore, considering the larger interest of the child and mother, the bail plea of the accused was allowed on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned.
Case title - Suraj v. State Of U.P. Thru. Prin. Secy. Home Lko. And Others [CRIMINAL MISC. BAIL APPLICATION No. - 3511 of 2022]

The Allahabad High Court has observed that the conduct of the judicial officers concerned in passing orders on printed proforma by filling up the blanks without application of judicial mind is objectionable and deserves to be deprecated.
The bench of Justice Shamim Ahmed observed thus while quashing the cognizance order of the Court of ASJ/POCSO-II Raibareli summoning a man accused of committing offences under Section 363, 366 I.P.C. and Sections 16 and 17 of POCSO Act, 2012.
The Court found that the Magistrate concerned had summoned the accused person on a printed proforma without assigning any reason while taking cognizance on the police report filed under Sections 173 of CrPC.
"The summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a serious matter and the order must reflect that Magistrate had applied his mind to the facts as well as law applicable thereto, whereas the impugned summoning order was passed in a mechanical manner without application of judicial mind and without satisfying himself as to which offence were prima-facie being made out against the applicants on the basis of the allegations made by the complainant. the impugned cognizance order passed by the learned Magistrate is against the settled judicial norms," the Court remarked in its order passed on Tuesday.
The case in brief
The bench was essentially dealing with the plea of the POCSO accused who had moved the Court challenging the entire criminal proceedings, chargseheet and summoning order in the case against him on the ground that no offence wa made out against the him.
His counsel further submitted that the Magistrate had taken the cognizance on the printed proforma by filling the sections of IPC, dates and number and in the said proforma and thus, he challenged the cognizance/summoning order of the magistrate as being passed withoit any application of mind.
On the other hand, though the counsel for the state submitted that the material evidence and allegations against the applicant, the cognizable offence against the applicants is made out, but he did not deny the fact that the Magistrate had taken cognizance on the printed proforma.
Court's observations
Taking into account the impugned order, arguments of both the sides, the Court observed that cognizance of an offence on complaint is taken for the purpose of issuing process to the accuse and since, it is a process of taking judicial notice of certain facts which constitute an offence, there has to be application of mind as to whether the material collected by the Investigating Officer results in sufficient grounds to proceed further.
The Court further stressed that judicial discretion puts a responsibility on the magistrate concerned to act judiciously keeping in view the facts of the particular case as well as the law on the subject and see to it that the orders do not not suffers from nonapplication of judicial mind while taking cognizance of the offence.
In this regard, the Court relied upon the rulings of the Apex Court wherein it was held that the magsitrate has to take cognizance of an offence after application of judicial mind and by reasoned order and not in mechanical manner.
The Court also relied upon the Allahbad High Court's ruling in the case of Abdul Rasheed and others Vs. State of U.P. and another 2010 (3) JIC 761 (All), wherein it was observed that judicial orders cannot be allowed to be passed in a mechanical manner either by filling in blank on a printed proforma or by affixing a ready made seal etc. of the order on a plain paper. In this very case, such tendency was deprecated.
Taking into account the abovementioned dicsussion, the Court found the order dated 08.02.2019 passed by the ASJ/POCSOII,Raibareli as cryptic as it held that the same did not stand the test of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court,
Consequently, the same was set quashed and the plea was lloawe. Further, the matter was remitted back to ASJ/POCSO-II Raibareli directing him to decide afresh the issue for taking cognizance and summoning the applicants and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law keeping in view the observations made by the Court within a period of two months.

The Rajasthan High Court, Jaipur upheld the decision of Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT), Alwar which, while relying on the 'principle of pay and recover', directed the insurance company to first pay compensation to the claimants and then recover the same from the vehicle owner.
 Justice Sudesh Bansal, observed, "Insurance Company has miserably failed to prove that the declaration of cancellation/ nullifying the driving licence of the Driver was ever brought to the knowledge of the owner of vehicle and it is not proved that the owner was guilty of negligence in not following the due care and caution to fulfil the conditions of the insurance policy, therefore, the Tribunal has not committed any error of law in following the principle of "pay and recover".
 Facts
 Essentially, the claim petition was filed in relation to an accident that occurred on 3-7-2015 when the vehicle in question overturned and one Mr.Vinit Moyal died. The vehicle in question, insured with the United India Insurance Company, was in the ownership of respondent Ashraf and was being driven by respondent Mustkim.
 On filing claim petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 the Tribunal awarded a compensation of Rs.47,99,536/- with interest in favour of the claimants. The Tribunal recorded that there was a breach of conditions of insurance policy as the driver was not having a valid and effective licence and that the vehicle was not having a route permit and fitness certificate on the date of accident.
 The Insurance Company was exonerated from liability and by applying the principle of "pay and recover" it was directed that the Insurance Company first will pay compensation to claimants and then may recover the same from owner and driver of the vehicle in question. The present appeals were filed against the aforementioned judgment and award passed by the MACT, Alwar.
 Findings
 Counsel for the Insurance Company raised three points, which were addressed by the court accordingly:
 (i) The driver of vehicle was not having a valid and effective licence on the date of accident,
 Relying on National Insurance Company Vs. Swaran Singh [(2004) 3 SCC 297], the court opined that the driving licence issued to Driver and renewed for a period from 10-8-2011 to 19-11-2015 was informed to be nullified vide public notice date 28-12-2017. The court further opined that the Tribunal should not have treated this as invalid and ineffective on the date of accident, which, however, has not been put to challenge by the claimants. In this regard, the court refused to interfere with such a finding of the Tribunal.
 Notably. in Swaran Singh, Apex Court observed that under the principle of "pay and recover", the insurer is liable to indemnify the compensation to a third party and may recover the same from the insured.
 (ii) Vehicle in question was not having a route permit and fitness certificate on the date of accident
 On the issue of the vehicle in question not having a route permit and fitness certificate on the date of accident, the court observed that nothing has been brought on record by the insured (owner of vehicle) to prove that he had a valid permit of vehicle on 3-7-2015.
 The court, while dismissing the second point, observed that recovery rights of Insurance Company against owner/ driver of vehicle are treated in context of principles laid down in  National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Challa Bharathamma [(2004)8 SCC 517]. In this, the Apex Court held that plying vehicle without a permit is an infraction and same is breach of conditions of insurance policy under Section 66 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, defence for the same is available to the insurer under Section 149(2) of the Act of 1988.
 Thus, the insurer is not required to file a separate suit to certify his right to recover the amount from the owner and driver of the vehicle, added the court. The court opined that the insurer may directly initiate proceedings before the Executing Court concerned, as the dispute between the insurer and owner/ driver of vehicle was subject matter of determination before the Tribunal and the issue has been decided against the owner/ driver in favour of the insurer.
 (iii) The Tribunal has assessed the quantum of compensation on higher side and prayed that impugned judgment be modified suitably.
 The court observed that the Tribunal has assessed the compensation after considering material on record and after due application of relevant rules and law. The compensation awarded by the Tribunal is just and proper. The court noted that the Insurance Company has failed to point out any illegality or perversity in this regard and thus, there is no force in this argument.
 After the perusal of the record, the court observed that Insurance Company has deposited entire compensation amount before the Tribunal pursuant to interim order dated 12-4-2019, out of which 50% amount of compensation has been disbursed to claimants according to order dated 5-8-2021 and therefore, remaining amount so deposited be also disbursed to claimants in terms of the award.
 Arguments
 The Insurance Company argued that when the Tribunal itself has held that there is breach of insurance policy then the claim petition ought to have been dismissed against the Insurance Company as a whole and the Tribunal committed an error of law in directing the Insurance Company to pay the compensation amount to claimants and then to recover from the owner of the vehicle.
On the other hand, the counsel for claimants submitted that the Tribunal has not committed any illegality or jurisdictional error in applying the principle of "pay and recover", as the vehicle in question was insured with the Insurance Company. He further argued that even if any breach of conditions of insurance policy, then also considering the beneficial object of the Act of 1988, the Tribunal is justified and well within its jurisdiction in directing the insurer to satisfy the award, though in law it has no liability.
 The counsel for claimants further contended that the right of the insurer to recover the amount of award from the owner and driver of the vehicle has been protected as well. He submitted that as far as the quantum of compensation is concerned, the same is rather lower side and deserves to be enhanced suitably. However, in any case, the Insurance Company cannot challenge the quantum of compensation as the same travels beyond defences available to Insurance Company under Section 149(2) of the Act, 1988, he argued.
 Lastly, counsel for the claimants submitted that in case the appeal filed Insurance Company is dismissed, the claimants would not press their appeal.
 Adv. Tripurari Sharma appeared on behalf of appellants, while Adv. Ram Sharan Sharma appeared for the respondents.
 Case Title: United India Insurance Company Ltd v. Smt Soniya

The Allahabad High Court recently denied bail to former Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly member Kamlesh Pathak in the Gangster Act Case registered against him.
 The bench of Justice Krishna Pahal did not find reasonable grounds for believing that Pathak is not guilty of such offence mentioned in the Gang Chart and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail
 The Court also took into account the gravity of offence and the criminal antecedents of Pathak to deny him the benefit of bail.
 Pathak along with 10 others were booked under Section 3(1) of the UP Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986 in the year 2020 on the allegations that he is running an organized and active gang in the area as its ‘leader’.
 A Gang chart was prepared against him specifying the offences he allegedly committed, including garnering illegal ransom, illegally possessing government land, fighting, firing, and other illegal criminal activities, etc. 
 It was also stated in the gang chart that in March 2020, Pathak and his gang members caused the daylight murder of advocate Manju Chaubey and his sister Sudha Chaubey to take illegal possession of the land. 
 It was also alleged that the members of his gang keep on committing the offences referred to in Sections 16, 17 and 22 of the U.P. Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act due to which the public at large is so much terrified that nobody dares to come forward and speak or make a statement against them.
 The said gang chart was sent to the office of the District Magistrate, Auraiya for sanction and once the sanction was received, the eleven members of the gang were 3 booked under the Gangster Act.
 Now, seeking bail in the case, Pathak moved the Court wherein his counsel argued that he has been booked owing to the political rivalry and has nothing to do with the double murder case (predicate offence of killing of two advocates) and that he has been granted bail in the said case.
 Several other submissions were made in his defence including that in 12 cases, closure reports have been submitted, and in 16 cases, he has been acquitted, that he is suffering from various ailments, that he is a senior citizen and is languishing in jail since March 2020.
 On the other hand, the state’s counsel submitted that the applicant is the person who very much qualifies for the definition of gangster defined under the Act. It was also submitted that the bail granted to the applicant in the predicate offence of Section 302 IPC is without jurisdiction and the same has been challenged before the Apex Court.
 It was also stated before the Court that the Pathak is the name of terror in the area and his muscle power is evident from the fact that no witnesses did ever dare to depose against him in court and almost all of them have turned hostile leading to his acquittal.
 It was also argued that the trial is going on in the predicate offence and there is every likelihood of the applicant influencing the witnesses as he has long criminal antecedents.
 Against this backdrop, the Court noted that in the predicate offence, the applicant allegedly exhorted the other co-accused persons to fire at the deceased and injured persons and thus, the element of actus reus and mens rea are present in the said case.
 Further, the Court opined that the present case does not seem to be a misuse of the State Gangster Act and the applicant, having such large criminal antecedents and being the head of the gang, is not entitled to bail.
 Against this backdrop, finding no grounds to release him on bail, the Court rejected his bail plea.

Case Title - Kamlesh Pathak vs. State of Uttar Pradesh [CRIMINAL MISC. BAIL APPLICATION No. - 21738 of 2022]

The Allahabad High Court has observed that if cognizance has been taken on a police report, then there is no need to pass a fully reasoned order if from the perusal of the cognizance order it appears that the court has applied its mind to the materials on record.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that if cognizance has been taken on a police report, then there is no need to pass a fully reasoned order if from the perusal of the cognizance order it appears that the court has applied its mind to the materials on record. 
It may be noted that a Police Report means a report forwarded by a police officer to a Magistrate under Section 173 (2) CrPC.
The bench of Justice Sameer Jain also clarified that even if there is an irregularity in the cognizance order passed by the Court, then also, on that ground, the proceedings cannot be vitiated in view of Section 465 Cr.P.C.
It may be noted that Section 465 of CrPC states that no finding, sentence or order of a competent court shall be reversed on account of irregularity unless there is a failure of justice.
The case in brief
The Court was essentially dealing with a 482 CrPC plea filed to quash a charge sheet as well as cognizance/summoning order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate-IV, Etawah and the enitre proceedings of a case under Sections 323, 504, 506, 308 IPC.
Before the Court, the petitioner's primary argument was that the cognizance order passed by the ACJM-IV, Etawah was bad, cryptic in nature, and passed on a printed proforma and that the same was passed without any application of mind. 
On the other hand, the State's counsel argued that since the instant case was a State case, therefore, there was no need to pass a detailed cognizance order and thus, the Court below had validly passed the same.
It was underscored before the Court that while passing the cognizance order, the court had perused the case diary and other documents and pieces of evidence collected by the Investigating Officer during the investigation, and thus, there was no illegality in the cognizance order.
Court's observations 
At the outset, relying upon the Apex Court's rulings in the cases of State of Gujarat Vs. Afroz Mohammad Hasanfatta (2019) 20 SCC 539 and Pradeep S. Wodeyar Vs. The State of Karnataka LL 2021 SC 691, the Court observed that since in the instant case, the cognizance was taken on a police report, therefore, there was no need for the Court below to pass a fully reasoned order.
"In the present case, cognizance order dated 20.03.2020 shows that while passing it, the court below perused the charge-sheet, case diary and other documents, which were collected by the Investigating Officer during investigation and thereafter court was of the view that prima facie ground for taking cognizance is sufficient, therefore, it cannot be said that without perusing the materials on record, court below took the cognizance," the Court remarked. [emphasis supplied]
Further, the Court also noted that even if there had been an irregularity in the cognizance order, then also, on the basis of it, the proceedings couldn't have been quashed as, the Court added, "the order of taking cognizance are interlocutory in nature and as per Section 465 Cr.P.C. proceedings on the basis of that irregularity cannot be vitiated.
It may be noted that in Pradeep S. Wodeyar case (supra), the apex court had also observed that an irregularity in the order taking cognizance will not vitiate the proceedings in a criminal trial.
Lastly, perusing the charge sheet and other documents on record, the Court found that prima facie, offence under Section 323, 504, 506, and 308 IPC was made out against the applicants, therefore, it concluded that there was no illegality in the charge sheet filed against the applicants.

The Supreme Court observed that functional convenience of one of the parties in commercial litigations cannot be a ground to transfer under Section 25 of Code of Civil Procedure.A petitioner seeking transfer of a case involving business-related disputes from one jurisdiction to another will have to establish some grave difficulty or prejudice in prosecuting or defending the case in a...
The Supreme Court observed that functional convenience of one of the parties in commercial litigations cannot be a ground to transfer under Section 25 of Code of Civil Procedure.
A petitioner seeking transfer of a case involving business-related disputes from one jurisdiction to another will have to establish some grave difficulty or prejudice in prosecuting or defending the case in a forum otherwise having power to adjudicate the cause, Justice Aniruddha Bose observed.
In this case, the petitioner company sought transfer of a subsequent suit instituted by the respondents against them in the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division, Pune to the Commercial Court, Ahmedabad.
The court noted that the petitioners' case is largely founded on the claim of having approached a judicial forum before the respondents did and both the suits emanate from the same set of facts with the same set of parties.
"The petitioners are not asserting that the Court at Pune lacks jurisdiction to entertain, try and determine the suit instituted by the respondents. There may also be some overlapping issues involved in both the suits. But that factor alone, in my opinion, does not confer right on the petitioners to bring the suit of the respondents to the jurisdiction of their choice where they have already instituted a suit, albeit for an independent set of reliefs. There is no bar in the Code of Civil Procedure (the Code) in institution of two different suits in two Courts by the same set of parties on same set of facts. The party having approached the Court first however has the right to apply before the Court in which the subsequent suit is instituted for stay of the latter proceeding, as stipulated in Section 10 of the Code, if the matters in issue in both the suits are directly and substantially the same. The factor which needs consideration while examining a plea for transfer in a petition under Section 25 of the code is whether allowing such petition would be expedient in the ends of justice or not. This Court has to consider the prayer for transfer with an element of equity. These factors, by themselves cannot be the ground for invoking the provisions of Section 25 of the Code.", the judge said.
Regarding the submission that the senior management executives of the petitioners arraigned as defendants are foreign national running business operations in Ahmedabad and they are more familiar and accustomed to Ahmedabad, the bench observed:
"Functional convenience of one of the parties in commercial litigations cannot determine exercise of jurisdiction of this Court under Section 25 of the Code. The yardstick applied in entertaining transfer petition of an estranged homemaker having no independent income to bring a matrimonial action instituted by the husband to a Court within whose jurisdiction she has taken shelter in her parental home cannot be followed in commercial disputes. A petitioner seeking transfer of a case involving business-related disputes from one jurisdiction to another will have to establish some grave difficulty or prejudice in prosecuting or defending the case in a forum otherwise having power to adjudicate the cause. No such case of outstanding prejudice has been made out by the petitioners. What has been submitted is that the senior management executives of the petitioners arraigned as defendants are foreign national running business operations in Ahmedabad and they are more familiar and accustomed to Ahmedabad. This is not good enough reason, and transfer of the second suit cannot be directed to accommodate them. I am not satisfied that an order for transfer as prayed for in this petition, is expedient for the ends of justice."

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently held that in terms of Section 38 of the Special Marriage Act, a father can approach the Family Court which passed the decree of divorce based on mutual consent under Section 28 of the Special Marriage Act, for seeking custody of the child living with the mother.
It added that there is no independent right, after such decree is passed, to move under Section 25 of the Guardianship and Wards Act.
"...in terms of Section 38 of the Special Marriage Act, the respondent-husband has remedy to approach the said Court, which has passed the decree of divorce if any terms and condition were violated and, therefore, in view of the above mentioned two judgments, the petition filed by the respondent-father in terms of under Section 25 of the Guardianship and Wards Act is mis-conceived and is liable to be rejected, being barred by the provisions of Section 38 of the Special Marriage Act.
The bench comprising Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan further noted that it is not a case of deciding the rights of the parents but the custody of minor child, therefore, the paramount consideration of the welfare of the child should not be ignored.
Moreover, it is a case of not deciding the rights of the parents but the custody of minor child, therefore, the Court cannot ignore the paramount consideration as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a number of judgments that the welfare of the child should be the paramount consideration, while dealing with the custody of a minor child and, therefore, the circumstances from the date of birth of the child till date needs to be appreciated.
The court was dealing with a petition for setting aside the order passed by the Family Court vide which an application filed by the petitioner-wife to dismiss the petition filed by the respondent-husband for claiming the custody of 'A' was declined. 
After hearing the counsel for the parties and on going through the record, the court noted that for the purpose of deciding an application under Section VII Rule 11 CPC, the contents of the plaint/petition is to be seen, however, the mutual consent divorce petition filed by the parents under Section 28 of the Special Marriage Act needs to be scrutinized carefully regarding voluntarily statement of father giving the custody to the mother and not pleading the agreement.
Though it is well settled principle of law that for the purpose of deciding an application under Section VII Rule 11 CPC, the contents of the plaint/petition is to be seen, however, in the previous divorce petition filed by both the parents on the basis of the mutual consent under Section 28 of the Special Marriage Act (as there was marriage was performed under the said Act) needs to be scrutinized carefully regarding their voluntarily statement of father for giving the custody of the child to the mother and not pleading the agreement dated 13.10.2017 till the time the decree was passed.
Thus, the court provided following undisputed facts on the basis of which this petition deserves to be allowed :-
The respondent No.1, filed a joint petition with petitioner for dissolution of the marriage by way of a decree of divorce with mutual consent and specifically stated that the male baby 'A' shall remain in custody of his mother.When the petition was filed, again father made the statement that the minor child namely 'A' shall remain with the mother.Again, when the second motion was recorded, respondent-father acknowledges all the facts, including the date of marriage; birth of minor child 'A'; separation since September, 2015 and specific averment was made that the parties are bound with the earlier statement dated 17.10.2017.The alleged agreement came in existence before filing of petition, before the first motion and the second motion statements, but the respondent-father never relied upon the said agreement.Even in the judgment and decree passed by the Family Court, Sonepat, a condition was laid that the parties shall be bound by their statement.Though it is also well settled principle of law that once a party has denied the existence of an agreement, the same may require evidence to prove whether it is a genuine or a forged document, however, in the instant case, once this agreement was never relied upon in the proceedings before the Family Court which calminated into the decree of divorce between the parties by way of mutual consent on the basis of the statement.Even otherwise in view of the judgment in Rakesh Dua Vs. Mrs. Shoba Dua and Smt. Sibani Banerjee Vs. Tapan Kumar Mukherjee, the respondent-husband has remedy to approach the said Court, which has passed the decree of divorce if any terms and condition were violated.It is not case of father that child was forcibly removed from his custody rather it is his own case that the custody given to mother, therefore, petition under Section 25 of the Guardian and Wards Act is not maintainable.As the competent Court under the Special Marriage Act, 1956 even after passing the decree of divorce has jurisdiction under Section 38 of the Act to pass just and proper order with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of a minor child.
Accordingly, the court allowed instant petition and set aside the impugned order.

The Allahabad High Court has clarified that as per Section 202 (1) CrPC, if an accused resides beyond the jurisdictional area of a Magistrate then it is mandatory for such a Magistrate to either inquire into the case himself or direct an investigation to be made, before issuance of process under Section 204 CrPC.
The Bench of Justice Manju Rani Chauhan further observed that as per the provision of Section 202 Cr.P.C. (as amended with effect from 23.06.2006), the requirement is that in those cases, where the accused is residing at a place beyond the area in which the concerned Magistrate exercises his jurisdiction, it is mandatory on the part of Magistrate to conduct an inquiry or investigation before issuing the process.
The case in brief
Essentially, a complaint was made by a lady against her in-laws (petitioners before the Court) submitting that they used to harass her mentally and physically and she was sent back to her parents' house after around 7 months of the marriage. 
It was further averred in the complaint that when she came to know that they are not interested in calling her back, she requested them to return her Stree Dhan, however, they did not return the same, therefore, she was moving the instant complaint.
Now, on this complaint, the in-laws/Smt. Geeta And 4 Others (Petitioners) of the complaint were summoned by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate/Additional Civil Judge (Sr. Div.), Ghaziabad vide order dated September 15, 2021.
Challenging the said summoning order of the Magistrate, the Petitioners moved the Court with their 482 CrPC Plea seeking to quash the summoning order passed in a case under Section 406 I.P.C.
It was their contention that though the address of the applicants as mentioned in the complaint is Bengaluru, hence they are residents of Bengaluru but the concerned Magistrate sitting at Ghaziabad had summoned the applicants ignoring and had not complied with the provision of Section 202 Cr.P.C., 1973
Lastly, it was submitted that the procedure stipulated in the said provision was mandatory which imposes an obligation on the Magistrate to ensure that before summoning an accused, who resides beyond his jurisdiction, the Magistrate shall make necessary inquiries into the case himself or direct investigation to be made by a police officer or by such other person as he thinks fit for finding out whether or not there is sufficient ground to proceed against the accused.
Court's order
At the outset, the Court referred to Apex Court's rulings in Vijay Dhanuka v. Najima Mamtaj (2014) 14 SCC, Abhijir Pawar v. Hemant Madhukar Nimbalkar and another, (2017) 2 SCC 528 and Sunil Todi vs. The State of Gujarat, 2021 SCC Online SC 1174 638 to observe thus:
"(Under) Section 202(1) Cr.P.C. the enquiry or investigation, as the case may be, is mandatory before summons are issued against the accused living beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the concerned Magistrate...In view of the above, the impugned order is not sustainable in the eyes of law and is liable to be quashed."
With this, the application u/s 482 Cr.P.C. was allowed and the impugned order was quashed and the matter is remanded back to the Court below for the further proceeding, in accordance with the law, especially in view of the provisions of Section 202(1) Cr.P.C.

"A priori, when inaction or procrastination (intentionally or otherwise) is meted out in response to the attempt of setting the legal machinery in motion, what is put to peril is not just the individual cries for the assistance of law but also the foundational tenets of a society governed by the rule of law, thereby threatening the larger public interests. The denial of timely inquiry and by a competent forum, inevitably results in denial of justice and violation of fundamental right."
 Taking strong exception to "improper handling" of the complaint of sexual harassment made by a former employee of the RAW, the Supreme Court on Friday directed the Union of India to pay "constitutional compensation" to the tune of Rs. 1,00,000/- for "impigning upon the Fundamental rights of the Petitioner".
 A bench of Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice Dinesh Maheshwari noted that the Petitioner was subjected to "insensitive and undignified circumstances" by the organization which constituted an Internal Complaints Committee in accordance with the guidelines laid down in Vishaka and Others v. State of Rajasthan and Others, after a delay of three months.
 While the Committee concluded that the allegations of sexual harassment could not be proved, the court observed,
 "In the present case, the petitioner had faced exceedingly insensitive and undignified circumstances due to improper handling of her complaint of sexual harassment. Regardless of the outcome of the inquiry into the stated complaint, the fundamental rights of the petitioner had been clearly impinged. Taking overall view of the circumstances, we consider this to be a fit case to award compensation to the petitioner for the stated violation of her right to life and dignity, quantified at Rs.1,00,000/-."
 The Petitioner had made complaints of sexual harassment against her seniors, Ashok Chaturvedi, the then Secretary in charge of the organisation and Sunil Uke, the then joint secretary.
 She had alleged that the charged officers subjected her to harassment by asking her to join the sex racket running inside the Organisation for securing quicker promotions and upon refusal to oblige, she was subjected to persecution.
 The court noted that the Organisation responded to the allegations of sexual harassment after a gap of almost three months by constituting a Complaints Committee which did not consist of a "third party as a representative of an NGO or other body who is familiar with the issue of sexual harassment", as predicated by the guidelines given in Vishaka (supra).
 Subsequently, the Committee was re­constituted with the addition of Dr. Tara Kartha, Director, National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), which ultimately submitted that the allegations of sexual harassment were not proven against Sunil Uke.
 During this period however, the court noted, there were glaring incidents of violation of the Fundamental rights of the Petitioner, whose complaints of sexual harassment were met with "procedural ignorance" and "casual attitude" of her seniors in the department.
 The bench observed that there were "unwarranted attacks" on the Petitioner's psychological status, clearly in violation of her right to life with dignity.
 In these circumstances, the Court recalled,
 "The approach of law as regards the cases of sexual harassment at workplace is not confined to cases of actual commission of acts of harassment, but also covers situations wherein the woman employee is subjected to prejudice, hostility, discriminatory attitude and humiliation in day to day functioning at the workplace."
 The bench observed that the scheme of the 2013 Act, Vishaka Guidelines and Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) predicates that a "non-hostile" working environment is the basic limb of a dignified employment. 
 The present case, the bench averred, is replete with lack of sensitivity on the part of Secretary (R) qua the complaint of sexual harassment. "To wit, time taken to process the stated complaint and improper constitution of the first Complaints Committee (intended or unintended) in violation of the Vishaka Guidelines, constitute an appalling conglomeration of undignified treatment and violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioner, more particularly Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution," it held.
 The bench thus ordered the Union of India to compensate the Petitioner, for subjecting her to a hostile work environment, denying timely representation before a Complaints Committee, and violating her right to life with dignity.
 "A priori, when inaction or procrastination (intentionally or otherwise) is meted out in response to the attempt of setting the legal machinery in motion, what is put to peril is not just the individual cries for the assistance of law but also the foundational tenets of a society governed by the rule of law, thereby threatening the larger public interests. The denial of timely inquiry and by a competent forum, inevitably results in denial of justice and violation of fundamental right," the court held.
However the Bench has upheld the RAW's order of compulsory retirement passed against the appellant/petitioner.
In this case, the bench was also confronted to decide the Constitutional validity of Rule 135 of the RAW (Recruitment, Cadre and Services) Rules, 1975, which gives power to the Central government to voluntary retire RAW Officers whose identity is exposed or compromised.
 While upholding the same, the bench remarked, "Exposure of an intelligence officer could be hazardous not only for the Organisation but also for the officer concerned."
 Case Details:
 Case Title: Nisha Priya Bhatia v. Union of India & Anr.
 Case No.: CA No. 2365/2020
 Quorum: Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice Dinesh Maheshwari
 Read Judgment

On issuance of Look Out Circulars, the Punjab and Haryana High Court recently held that an LOC could not be requested by Indian banks to recover the dues owed to their foreign sister concerns. 
Rejecting the argument that these activities affect the economic interest of India, a Division Bench of Justices Ramchandra Rao and Harkesh Manuja held that no adverse effects on the economic interests of India have been made out in the instant case. It observed, 
"How such a thing can happen if a foreign incorporated Company M/s AIF, UAE owes money to UAE based entities of the Bank of Baroda and the SBI, is not explained by any of the respondents...By no stretch of imagination can it be said that the dues of Bank of Baroda, Dubai and SBI, Dubai are the dues of their Indian sister concerns. This is because the Dubai entity and the Indian entity have separate and distinct personalities."
The Court was hearing a plea challenging the lookout order issued by the Bureau of Immigration against the Directors of a UAE based company, preventing them from travelling abroad.
The company had borrowed loans from the Bank of Baroda, Dubai and SBI, Dubai, wherein the petitioners were guarantors. However, the loan accounts turned into non-performing assets, and an outstanding amount to Rs. 290.62 crores had to be recovered. Moreover, the petitioners are said to have committed fraud and engaged in cheque bounce cases leading to conviction by a Dubai Court in one of these cases, with imprisonment for three years.
It is also stated that both petitioners had fled UAE and are staying in Delhi, India and they may leave India at any point of time to avoid legal actions and may not return to India. Therefore, the LOCs were issued so that they cannot be allowed to leave India.
On the question of maintainability, it was held that though the respondents may be based outside Haryana, part cause of action arose (based on residence of the petitioner and mortgaged properties location) within the jurisdiction of the Court and thus it has territorial jurisdiction to entertain this petition under Article 226(2) of the Constitution of India. It relied on the case of Kusum Ingots & Alloys v. Union of India & Anr., where it was held that even if a small fraction of cause of action accrues within the jurisdiction of the High Court, maintainability can be justified.
Referring to the relevant law in force, the Court held that LOCs were permitted to be opened essentially against persons: (i) involved in cognizable offences; and (ii) who was evading arrest and not appearing in the trial Court despite non-bailable warrants or other coercive measures; and (iii) where there was a likelihood that they would leave the country to evade trial/arrest. 
However, as per the Indian Law, offence of dishonour of cheques is a non-cognizable offence. Thus, the Court observed,
"It was intended as a coercive measure to make a person surrender to the investigating agency or Court of law. But where the subject of the LOC is not involved in any cognizable offence, he cannot be detained/arrested or prevented from leaving the country. The originating agency can only request that they be informed about the arrival/departure of the subject in such cases."
It observed that initially Managing Directors and Chief Executive Officers of the Public Sector Banks weren't authorised to make requests for the opening of LOCs. They were included in the list of authorities who can seek LOCs eventually. This was done to enable LOCs to be issued against the persons who are fraudsters/persons who wish to take loans and run against the economic interests of India or in the larger public interest. 
The Court held that in the instant case, the request for issuance of LOC alleging loan defaults should not have been acceded to as: (i) office memorandums by the Union of India cannot have an extra-territorial operation and apply to loan defaults caused to a bank incorporated and based out of UAE; and (ii) it cannot be said that dues of banks in Dubai are the dues of their Indian sister concerns, as they have separate and distinct personalities. 
The Court noted that the documents issued by the Union of India and the Ministry of Home Affairs do not draw a line as to the quantum of default that will be considered detrimental to the economic interests of India. It observed, 
"Merely because the word 'public' is used in the exception clause in the OM, it does not elevate a mere default to an exceptional plane. It cannot be said that the departure of the petitioner from the country would adversely impact the economy of the 'country as a whole and destabilize the 'entire economy' of the country."
Deciding in favour of the petitioner, the Court held that the subject of a lookout circular could not be detained or arrested where there is no cognizable offence. It noted that the originating agency could only request that they be informed about the arrival or departure of the subject in such cases. 
It held that the issuing authority had not applied its mind to the request for the Look Out Circular (LOC) made by the Indian banks. The LOCs were issued mechanically without enquiring whether the grounds for issuing a lookout circular were fulfilled or not, it added.
Referring to the case of Maneka Gandhi, the Court observed that the right to travel abroad is now a part of the fundamental right to life and liberty under Article 21, which can only be restrained on a very high threshold, which was not met in the instant case.

The Supreme Court of India on Monday held that claims raised by an obstructor including questions relating to right, title or interest in the property in execution proceedings filed by the decree holder against the judgment debtor, has to be adjudicated upon by the Executing Court in the execution proceedings itself.

The Supreme Court of India on Monday held that claims raised by an obstructor including questions relating to right, title or interest in the property in execution proceedings filed by the decree holder against the judgment debtor, has to be adjudicated upon by the Executing Court in the execution proceedings itself. 
The Bench has held that in accordance with Order XXI Rule 101 CPC, an application filed under Order XXI Rule 97 with respect to resistance or obstruction to possession of immovable property have to be determined by the Court dealing with the application and for that a separate suit is not required to be filed.
A Bench comprising Justice MR Shah and Justice BV Nagarathna has made the observations while delivering its judgement in a civil appeal filed by Bangalore Development Authority challenging the Karnataka High Court's order dismissing writ petitions filed by Bangalore Development Authority against the order passed by the Executing Court dismissing its applications under Order XXI Rule 97 CPC in Execution Case filed by the decree holder (R1) against the judgment debtor (R2)
"Therefore, as per Order XXI Rule 101 CPC, all questions including questions relating to right, title or interest in the property arising between the parties to a proceeding on an application under Order XXI rule 97 or rule 99 CPC and relevant to the adjudication of the application shall have to be determined by the Court dealing with the application. For that a separate suit is not required to be filed. Order XXI Rule 97 is with respect to resistance/obstruction to possession of immovable property," the judgement authored by Justice MR Shah reads.
The Bench noted that it is the specific case of the BDA that pursuant to the acquisition of the land in question, the BDA has become the absolute owner and the said land is vested in the BDA. Further possession was already taken over by the BDA and the land was handed over to the Engineering Section. 
The Bench has therefore held that the applications submitted by BDA for impleadment in the execution proceedings and the obstruction against handing over the possession to the decree holder were required to be adjudicated upon by the Executing Court by impleading the BDA as a party to the execution proceedings.
It has further been observed that even though a substantive suit filed by the BDA against the decree holder and the judgment debtor to declare the lease agreement as null and void is pending, irrespective of the same, considering Order XXI Rule 101 CPC, the question relating to right, title or interest of the BDA in the suit property was required to be adjudicated upon by the Executing Court.
The Bench has passed the order and issued the directions in consideration of the following aspects:
The BDA is claiming right, title or interest in the land in question being acquired under the provisions of the 1976 Act.The lease agreement between the decree holder and the judgment debtor is subsequent to the acquisition of the suit land.The case of BDA is that such a transaction is null and void once the suit land for which the lease agreement was executed was acquired under the provisions of the 1976 Act.The award was also declared and a notification under Section 16(2) of the Land Acquisition Act evidencing taking over possession of the land by BDA was also published. 
"Therefore, when BDA which has submitted the obstruction/objection in the execution proceedings filed by the decree holder against the judgment debtor with respect to suit land which was acquired by BDA and when the BDA claims right, title or interest in the suit property, such obstruction was required to be adjudicated upon by the Executing Court while considering the application/obstruction under Order XXI Rule 97 or Rule 99 CPC," the Bench has held.
While allowing BDA's appeal, the Bench has set aside the order passed by the Executing Court dismissing the applications filed by the BDA for impleadment in the execution proceedings and/ dismissing the obstruction application.
The Apex Court has also set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court dated 21.03.2016 dismissing the writ petitions filed BDA and upholding order dated 29.01.2015 passed by the Executing Court
The Bench directed the Executing Court to implead the BDA in the execution petition and thereafter adjudicate upon the obstruction or objection raised by BDA including the question relating to right, title or interest claimed by BDA in the suit land on the basis of the acquisition of the suit property acquired under the provisions of the 1976 Act. The Bench has granted a time period of six months for completion of the same. 
Case Title: Bangalore Development Authority vs N. Nanjappa and another

The Kerala High Court on Friday directed Ilaha College of Arts and Science to admit a candidate who had been denied admission on the belief that he would disrupt the discipline of the College. 
Justice Devan Ramachandran, while issuing the direction, was of the view that the petitioner was being denied admission to the College based on 'speculative reasons'. 
"...it is evident that the College is refusing admission to the petitioner based on certain speculative reasons. It may be true that there was an incident in the past, which led to a police complaint being filed against the petitioner, but this does not ipso facto mean that his attempt is to 'wreck vengeance'", the Court observed.
The petitioner in this case had been allotted the Ilaha College of Arts and Science (hereinafter 'College') by the MG University (the 1st respondent herein) for the B.A. Economics course. It is the case of the petitioner that despite presenting his memo of allotment to the Principal, he was not granted admission. Aggrieved, he preferred the instant writ petition.
It was contended by the Standing Counsel for the College P.M. Saneer that the petitioner intended to 'wreak vengeance' upon the College, since the latter had denied admission to the petitioner on the ground of lack of merit, when he had earlier approached it to seek admission in Management quota. It was submitted that thereafter, the petitioner had created a ruckus in the college, because of which a complaint had been filed by the College against him to the Sub Inspector, Muvattupuzha Police Station. It was further submitted that the College had itself submitted a letter to the University on the bona fide belief that the petitioner would disrupt the discipline of the College, if admitted. 
The Standing Counsel for the University Surin George Ipe contended that the College was attempting to 'wriggle out of its statutory obligation', and that the latter approached the University with the letter only on 6th October 2022, while the admission had to be completed by the end of September, 2022. It was added that since the admission procedure was completed, the actions of the College would have to be considered seriously. 
The Court while allowing the admission of the candidate in this case, noted that if the College had any objection regarding the admission of the petitioner, the same ought to have been raised before the competent Authority before the next allotment period was completed. 
However, the College was granted liberty to pursue the matter before the University, and the latter was also directed to decide the same after hearing both sides. 
Importantly, the Court added that the petitioner was being admitted to the College on his express undertaking that he would act in strict compliance of the discipline of the College and would not exhibit any conduct in breach thereof.
Advocates Philip M. Varughese, Mathews Joseph, Aiswaria Devi R., Chacko Mathews K., Sreekumar P.N., Emmanuel Cyriac, and Elizabeth George appeared on behalf of the petitioner. 
Case Title: Muhammad Afreethi v. Mahatma Gandhi University & Anr. 

The Delhi High Court has ruled that while dealing with a petition filed under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act), if the arbitration clause between the parties in the Special Conditions of Contract (SCC), which does not contain the mandate of a pre-arbitral procedure, is claimed to be overridden by another arbitration clause existing in the...
The Delhi High Court has ruled that while dealing with a petition filed under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act), if the arbitration clause between the parties in the Special Conditions of Contract (SCC), which does not contain the mandate of a pre-arbitral procedure, is claimed to be overridden by another arbitration clause existing in the General Conditions of Contract (GCC), which mandates following a pre-arbitral mechanism, the same must be adjudicated by the Arbitral Tribunal as per the Kompetenz-Kompetenz principle.
 While referring the parties to arbitration despite the fact that the claimant had not followed the pre-arbitral mechanism envisaged in the GCC, the Court ruled that since all the agreements executed between the parties must be construed harmoniously, the invocation of arbitration proceedings cannot be rendered void due to a mere discrepancy arising out of the relevant clauses contained in the agreements.
 The bench of Justice Chandra Dhari Singh also remarked that a ‘No-Claim Declaration’ given by a party would not extinguish its remedy to invoke arbitration under the arbitration clauses contained in the agreements or render the arbitration agreement void, in view of the Doctrine of Severability. 
 The petitioner, M/s Kuldeep Kumar Contractor, and the respondent, Hindustan Prefab Ltd, entered into an Agreement for execution of a Construction Contract. The petitioner made a claim in terms of the said Agreement, including raising a final bill for the work performed by it and for refund of the security deposit.
 The respondent denied the claims raised by the petitioner under the Agreement. 
 Subsequent to this, the petitioner submitted a ‘No-Claim Certificate’, as insisted by the respondent, for the purpose of release of the security deposit.
 Since the respondent, Hindustan Prefab, failed to clear petitioner’s outstanding bills, the petitioner invoked the arbitration clause contained in the Special Conditions of Contract (SCC) and filed a petition under Section 11 of the A&C Act before the Delhi High Court, seeking appointment of arbitrator. 
 The respondent, Hindustan Prefab, argued before the High Court that since the petitioner, Kuldeep Kumar Contractor, had issued a ‘No-Claim Certificate’, there were no disputes between the parties that were required to be adjudicated through arbitration.
 It added that though an arbitration clause is contained in both the General Conditions of Contract (GCC) and the SCC, however, as per relevant clause contained in the GCC, the pre-arbitration procedure contemplated under it was sine qua non for invoking arbitration. Since the petitioner failed to follow the pre-arbitration mechanism provided under the GCC, the Section 11 petition was pre-mature, it averred.
 To this, the petitioner, Kuldeep Kumar Contractor, pleaded that pre-arbitration procedure was not mandated under the SCC. It thus averred that the pre-arbitration procedure provided under the GCC was redundant and superseded by the arbitration clause contained in the SCC.
 Referring to the ‘Doctrine of Severability’, the bench reckoned that an arbitration agreement is undoubtedly independent from the principal agreement, and thus, the arbitration agreement continues to be in effect even if the main contract is invalidated, vitiated, or terminated for any reason.
 The Court concluded that, in view of the Doctrine of Severability, the fact that the petitioner, Kuldeep Kumar Contractor, had issued a ‘No-Claim Certificate’ would not vitiate the arbitration clause contained in the SCC. 
 “In view of the foregoing discussions, this Court while adjudicating the Issue No. I finds that if a No-Claim Declaration has been given by a party it would not render the entire arbitration agreement void on the basis of Doctrine of Severability,” the Court said.
 Referring to the facts of the case, the bench took note that as per the Agreement executed between the parties, the contract shall be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of all the documents executed between them, including the GCC and the SCC.
 It further referred to the principle of Kompetenz-Kompetenz, as per which the Arbitral Tribunal is empowered and has competence to rule on its own jurisdiction, including determining the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement.
 The bench reckoned that an arbitration clause existed in both the SCC as well as the GCC. However, though a pre-arbitration procedure had to be followed, as stipulated in the GCC, the same was not mandated under the SCC, the Court noted.
 The Court concluded that since all the agreements executed between the parties, including the GCC and the SCC, are to be construed harmoniously, the invocation of arbitration proceedings cannot be rendered void due to a mere discrepancy arising out of the two relevant clauses contained in the GCC and SCC.
 While holding that the petitioner had complied with the procedure stipulated in the SCC enabling him to file the Section 11 petition before the Court, the Court said, “Since, the parties are in conflict with two different clauses of two separate agreements, this Court is of the view that the same requires interpretation of the said clauses to figure out the prevalence of one clause over another. Thus, this Court without adjudicating upon the interpretation finds it imperative to refer the same to an arbitrator in light of the precedent settled by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Vidya Drolia (supra).”
 The Court thus allowed the petition, appointed a Sole Arbitrator and referred the parties to arbitration.

The Madras High Court has held that an arbitral award that does not provide for payment of mandatory statutory compensation with respect to the land acquired under the National Highways Act, 1956 is perverse.

The Madras High Court has held that an arbitral award that does not provide for payment of mandatory statutory compensation with respect to the land acquired under the National Highways Act, 1956 is perverse.
 The Single Bench of Justice P.T. Asha held that an Arbitrator exercising jurisdiction under the National Highways Act has to be more vigilant in ensuring that the arbitral award is fair and that the land owner is compensated adequately as per his legal entitlement. The Court upheld the order of the District Judge that had set aside the arbitral award and had directed the competent authority to pay compensation to the land owner as provided under the statute. 
 A specified land was acquired under the National Highways Act, 1956 and compensation was awarded to the 1st respondent/land owner T. Palanisamy. Subsequently, certain disputes arose which were referred to arbitration. The 1st respondent raised claims seeking enhancement in compensation and against the non-payment of compensation in respect of certain buildings acquired. Thereafter, the compensation awarded by the Special District Revenue Officer was revised and the Arbitrator cum District Collector confirmed the revised compensation. The 1st respondent/land owner filed a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act) to set aside the award passed by the Arbitrator cum District Collector and to direct the competent authority to sanction the statutory benefits available to the 1st respondent/ land owner. The petition under Section 34 of the A&C Act was allowed and the Principal District Judge set aside the arbitral award. The District Judge passed an order directing the competent authorities to pay additional market value to the first respondent along with solatium and interest. The appellant Project Director, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) filed an appeal against the order of the District Judge under Section 37 of the A&C Act before the Madras High Court.
 The appellant NHAI submitted before the Madras High Court that under the provisions of Section 34 of the A&C Act, the power of the Court is restricted and the Court does not have the power to modify or vary the award passed by the Arbitrator. The appellant contended that the Court can only set aside the award on the grounds set out in Section 34(2) of the A&C Act.
 The 1st respondent/land owner submitted that award of solatium is a statutory right and its denial by the Arbitrator can be challenged before the Court. The 1st respondent contended that the Principal District Judge did not set aside the award passed by the Arbitrator, but only modified it to include the relief which the 1st respondent was statutorily entitled to. Thus, the 1st respondent averred that no appeal could lie under Section 37 of the A&C Act before the High Court.
 Section 23(1-A) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 provides that the Court shall award an additional market value of 12% on the land acquired under the Land Acquisition Act. Additionally, Section 23 (2) provides that the Court shall award a sum of 30% on such market value, in consideration of the compulsory nature of the acquisition. Proviso to Section 28 provides for interest at the rate of 15% on the excess compensation as specified under the Land Acquisition Act.
 Section 3 J of the National Highways Act, 1956 provides that nothing in the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 shall apply to an acquisition under the National Highways Act.
 The High Court noted that the Supreme Court in the case of Union of India and Another versus Tarsem Singh and Others (2019) has declared that the provisions of Section 3 J of the National Highways Act are unconstitutional insofar as it relates to Section 23(1-A), Section 23 (2) and the proviso to Section 28 of the Land Acquisition Act. 
 The High Court observed that the first respondent/land owner was not aggrieved by the amount of compensation but with the omission to grant the statutory compensation payable under the Land Acquisition Act, which included the additional market value at 12%, solatium at 30% and interest.
 The Court noted that the Supreme Court in the case of Narain Das Jain versus Agra Nagar Mahapalika (1991) had ruled that there is no discretion with the Court to not award solatium and that it automatically follows the market value of the land acquired, as a shadow would to a man.
 The High Court thus held that the additional market value at 12%, solatium at 30% and interest are an integral part of the award which are not required to be pleaded by the land owner to be paid to him. The Court added that the said amounts have been omitted to be given to the land owner by the Arbitrator and the omission had been corrected by the Principal District Judge in a petition under Section 34 of the A&C Act.
 The Court ruled that arbitral proceedings under the National Highways Act are not conducted by consensus amongst the parties but it is a mechanism thrust upon a land owner. The Court held that in the case of a land owner whose lands have been acquired under the National Highways Act and the Arbitrator fails to pass an order for payment of solatium, the land owner is left with no alternate to have the award corrected in a Section 34 petition.
 "A land owner whose lands have been acquired under the Land Acquisition Act can have the omission rectified in the proceedings that he files in the civil Court against the award passed by the Land Acquisition Officer or in the further appeal to the Appellate Court. However, in the case of a land owner whose lands have been acquired under the NH Act and the Arbitrator fails to pass an order for payment of solatium etc., he is left with no alternate to have the award corrected in a Section 34 petition."
 The Court ruled that an Arbitrator exercising jurisdiction under the National Highways Act has to be more vigilant in ensuring that the award is fair and that the person is compensated adequately as per his legal entitlement. 
 The Court reiterated that the payment of solatium is compulsory and is payable even in the absence of a specific plea or proof by the land owner as per the law laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Union of India and Another versus Tarsem Singh and Others (2019). The Court thus held that the 1st respondent/land owner was entitled to the benefits of Section 23(1-A), Section 23(2) and the proviso to Section 28 of the Land Acquisition Act.
 The Court observed that as per the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Dyna Technologies Pvt Ltd versus Crompton Greaves Limited (2019), the arbitral awards should not be interfered with in a casual manner unless the Court comes to the conclusion that the perversity of the award goes to the root of the matter and there is no possibility of an alternative interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award. The Court added that the arbitral award passed by the arbitrator was perverse in as much as the mandatory compensation amounts were not provided to the land owner.
 The Court thus held that there was no reason to interfere with the order passed by the Principal District Court.
 The Court thus dismissed the appeal.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently reiterated that a judicial magistrate is not competent to order re-investigation in a case nor is he empowered to transfer the case from one investigating agency to another.
 Justice M A Chowdhary observed,
"No other Court except the Superior /Constitutional Courts is vested with the powers to order reinvestigation or transfer investigation of a case from one agency to another, to secure the ends of justice."
The remarks were made while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had sought quashing of an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Jammu directing SP Crime Branch to re-investigate a case against petitioner for the commission of offences punishable under Sections 420, 467, 468, Section 471 of the Ranbir Penal Code (RPC).
 In the instant matter, based on a complaint filed by one Beero Devi against petitioner, Kamlesh Devi before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jammu, (Special Mobile Magistrate Passenger Tax and Shops Act) under Section 156(3) CrPC the Court had directed the Police to conduct investigation.
 Subsequently a case was registered and after collecting the material/documentary evidence and recording the statements of witnesses, it was found that the allegations levelled in the complaint were false, manipulated and without any basis. Hence, the Police considered it a fit case to proceed against the complainant under Section 182 CrPC for having lodged a false and frivolous case.
 Thereafter, the police filed a closure report before the CJM of Jammu who transferred the case to another Judicial Magistrate (Special Mobile Magistrate Passenger Tax and Shops Act) for disposal under law. Special Mobile Magistrate then issued summons to complainant Beero Devi and recorded her statement wherein she deposed that she was not satisfied with the investigation and, therefore, the same should be transferred to the Crime Branch Jammu.
 As a consequence the Judicial Magistrate by an order dated July 28, 2010 transferred the investigation of the case from Kanachak Police Station, Jammu to Crime Branch, Jammu relying on Statutory Regulatory Order (SRO) 202, dated June 3, 1999 with the understanding that the Crime Branch Jammu was empowered to carry out the investigation in a case of forgery.
 Challenging the order of transfer counsel for the petitioner contended that the Magistrate was not competent to direct re-investigation of the case to be carried out by a different police agency. Counsel further submitted that even the Crime Branch was not competent to investigate the matter in terms of SRO 202 which does not empower the Crime Branch to investigate any offences which is not scheduled in the Annexure to SRO.
 The moot questions that fell for adjudication were:-
 i) whether a judicial Magistrate is competent to transfer the investigation of the case from local police station to Crime Branch of the police agency; and
 ii) whether the Crime Branch was competent to conduct investigation of a case regarding forgery of certificate as per the directions of the Magistrate.
 Deliberating on the first issue, Justice Chowdhary observed that no court except the superior/Constitutional courts is vested with the powers to order re-investigation or transfer investigation of a case from one agency to another.
 In its bid to answer the second question the bench observed that the government of J&K through Home Department had issued SRO 202 specifying the classes of cases to be investigated by the crime branch within J&K for the purposes of registration and investigation.
 The bench further noted that the Crime Branch can also register other cases for investigation which may be referred to it by the government or Director General of Police from time to time as per the notification (SRO 202).
 Discussing the matter further the bench explained that in terms of the above, the assignment of the cases to the Crime Branch can take place either by the government or by the DGP, and therefore the judicial magistrate was not competent to transfer investigation of the case from one investigating agency to other.
 In view of the the discussion above the Court quashed the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Jammu (Special Mobile Magistrate Passenger Tax and Shops Act) and upheld the order to the extent not accepting the closure report filed by the Police Station Kanachak.

"Since 75th Independence Day Celebrations, Government has marked Azadi-ka-Amrit Mahotsav terming it to be 'Amrit Kaal' with prospective vision in the welfare of citizens of the country, however, Police Administration feels more comfortable to remain with colonial structure," the Allahabad High Court observed recently while taking exception to a counter affidavit filed by the state in an anticipatory bail plea stating that the applicant is of criminal intent.
The bench of Justice Manju Rani Chauhan also took to task the deponent of the counter affidavit (Deputy Superintendent of Police/ Circle Officer, Sahawar, District Kasganj) by observing that the officer believed himself to be empowered with sanction to author a certificate of the propensity of a person without any cogent material.
"A bare reading of the averments in counter affidavit whereby the applicant is said to be of criminal intent appears to be on the basis of skewed information. No such officer is allowed to enjoy impunity on the pretext of discharging official functioning nor can be set free to form an audacious remark without any basis," the bench observed.
The Court also found faults with Government Counsel I.P.S. Rajpoot, AGA-I who drafted the affidavit as he did not hesitate in proving the applicant to be of criminal mind without adducing any substance in support thereof.
Consequently, the Court sought a personal affidavit of the deponent of the counter affidavit (Shailendra Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police/ Circle Officer, Sahawar, District Kasganj), within ten days, as to what was in his possession for making the statement in question and to remain present before the Court on the said date along with the record of the case. 
 The Court also directed the AGA to remain present before this Court on the next date fixed to explain his conduct of dictating counter affidavit in such an irresponsible manner.
Essentially, the Court was dealing with an anticipatory bail plea filed by one Chantara in connection with offences under Sections 498A, 304-B, 201 IPC and 3/4 D.P. Act. On September 9, 2020, she was granted interim protection allowing two weeks' time for the State to file a counter affidavit.
Now, when the counter affidavit filed by the state was perused by the Court, it noted that the same was filed in a cavalier manner and the same was also bereft of any cogent or coherent factual and legal foundation.
The basis of the Court's observation was primarily paragraph 10 of the counter affidavit wherein it was stated that 'लेकिन प्रार्थनी आपराधिक प्रवृति की महिला है' (But the applicant is a woman of criminal nature). The Court noted that the said statement was made without annexing any document.
"Remaining reply in the entire counter affidavit rests on denial to each fact mentioned in the anticipatory bail application. Contents of counter affidavit reflects the impetuousness of Government Counsel as well as the deponent where each fact is negated sans due care constricting the role of the applicant as per their whims. This Court cannot turn a blind eye to such imprecise conduct of the deponent as well as learned Government Counsel brought in the counter affidavit," the Court added as it took serious note of the conduct of the AGA as well as the deponent.
The Court further observed that the reply appeared to be a transcription of parawise narratives sent by the concerned department, wherein, though most of the paragraphs were sworn to be verified on the basis of the record, however, nothing was brought on record in support thereof.
In this regard, the Court made the following strong observation
"Since 75th Independence Day Celebrations, Government has marked Azadi-ka-Amrit Mahotsav terming it to be 'Amrit Kaal' with prospective vision in welfare of citizens of the country, however, Police Administration feels more comfortable to remain with colonial structure. Such attitude of functionaries who are instrumental to safeguard the public at large diminishes the ingrained belief over the System and plays a role in impeding the goal set out to ascend to new heights of prosperity."
Further noting that the averments in the counter affidavit were made on the basis of skewed information, the Court stressed that it is the prime duty of the A.G.A. also who drafts counter affidavit to acquire the material relying on which the averments being made in the counter affidavit.
Consequently, issuing directions to the AGA as well as the deponent, the Court posted the matter for further hearing on February 21, 2023.
Advocate Ajay Kumar Vashistha appeared for the applicant.
Case title - Chantara vs. State of U.P.

Observing that physical fitness is necessary for a proficient advocate and physical disabilities hamper the smooth functioniong of a lawyer, the Supreme Court recently granted relief to an advocate who had suffered 100% permanent disability due to an accident.
The Court partly allowed his appeal by enhancing the compensation awarded by the High Court from Rs 23,20,000/- to Rs 51,62,000/-.
The accident had happened in 1996, when the appellant was aged 5 years. The lower limb of the appellant got completely paralyzed for life as a result of the accident. On account of head injuries including the fracture in temporal bone, the development and capacity of the brain was not comparable to a common man. He was dependent on a wheel chair or motorized vehicle for movements.
The appellant later completed law degree and is now practising as a lawyer.
In 1997, a year after the accident, a claim petition was filed on behalf of the appellant seeking compensation of Rupees 2 crores. The MACT granted him a total compensation of Rs 9 lakhs in the award passed in 2002. 
Dissatisfied with the award, he appealed to the Punjab and Haryana High Court. In 2019, the High Court decided the appeal, enhancing the copensation to Rs 23,20,000/-.
Further aggrieved with the award, the appellant approached the Supreme Court. His main contention was that the High Court did not assess the loss of earnings for life-time and only computed the loss for only 10 years on the ground that he was no practicing as a lawyer.
The High Court granted Rs.6,00,000/­ only for 10 years because the appellant is now practicing as an advocate in the Court accepting his earning Rs.60,000/­ per annum.
Finding fault with the High Court's approach of confining the loss to only 10 years, the Supreme Court said that the appellant had suffered total disability for life.
"The High Court in the impugned order observed that the claimant has now started practice as an advocate, therefore, future loss of earning has been calculated only for 10 years, applying the multiplier of 16, without looking to the facts that claimant cannot perform the work of advocacy similar to the other advocates by attending the cases in different Courts", the Supreme Court said.
The bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and JK Maheshwari further observed :
"A judicial notice can be taken of the fact that for a proficient advocate the person must be physically fit as he is required to move frequently to attend the professional work reaching from one Court to other, and for movements to complete other professional commitments. Looking to the nature of injuries and the permanent disablement which the claimant has suffered, i.e., lower limb is completely paralyzed while his upper limb is partially paralyzed having 100% permanent disability resulting in bodily movements being hampered. The capacity of the claimant being an advocate cannot be equated with other practicing advocate having no deformity in the same profession. The claimant is required to make extraordinary efforts to attend the proceedings in the Court and to come up to the expectations of the client. The disablement suffered to the claimant is for whole life and in the said fact, in our considered view, the future loss of earning calculated by the High Court only for 10 years is not justified,"
"If we accept the future loss of earning Rs.5,000/­ per month as decided by the High Court which annually comes to Rs.60,000/­ and apply the multiplier of 18 as applicable looking to the age, then the sum comes to Rs.10,80,000/­, in the said head", the Court added.
The Court also said that the accident hampered the pursuit of his ambitions :
"The father of the appellant was a Professor and the mother was an IAS officer. The claimant has been nurtured and brought up in a status enjoyed by his parents. He was planning to become an Executive or IAS officer. On account of the injuries in temporal region and the permanent disability suffered, he was unable to do his studies as expected or planned. After sincere efforts he could have passed the LL. B and started the advocate profession", the judgment stated.
Undescores the importance of multiplier method
Remarking that "multiplier method has been recognized as most realistic and reasonable because it has been decided by looking at the age, inflation rate, uncertainty of life and other realistic needs," the bench said that the method should also be followed not only for determination of future loss of earning but for attendant charges.
 To adjudicate on the issue pertaining to adequacy of compensation, the bench in the judgement authored by Justice JK Maheshwari considered the medical opinions and findings.
 The Court relied on some English Judgements such as Philipps vs. London & South Western Railway Co. ­ (1879) LR 5 QBD 78, Mediana, In re ­ 1900 AC 113 (HL), H. West & Son Ltd. vs. Shephard ­ 1964 AC 326, Ward vs. James ­ (1966) 1 QB 273 to lay emphasis on the principles as to why the compensation be paid, what should be the basis for determination and what may be the reason for awarding such compensation.
 Further referring to the law laid down in R.D. Hattangadi vs. Pest Control (India) (P) Ltd. ­ (1995) 1 SCC 551, Raj Kumar vs. Ajay Kumar and another ­ (2011) 1 SCC 343, Kajal vs. Jagdish Chand and others ­ (2020) 4 SCC 413, the bench said,
 "In fact, not only for determination of future loss of earning but for attendant charges also the multiplier method should be followed. The multiplier method has been recognized as most realistic and reasonable because it has been decided by looking to the age, inflation rate, uncertainty of life and other realistic needs. Thus, for determination of just compensation to ensure justice with the family of the deceased or the injured as the case may be, the compensation can be determined applying said method. Therefore, in our view the Tribunal while granting the compensation of future loss as well as earning only for 10 years and attendant charges only for 20 years was not justified. In fact, the said amount should be determined applying the multiplier method."
 While also awarding non pecuniary damages, the bench said, "Under the head "non pecuniary damages", the claimant has faced the pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of injuries. It is to observe that to award compensation under the head "pain, shock and suffering", multiple factors are required to be considered from the date of accident, which include the prolonged hospitalization and regular medical assistance, nature of the injuries sustained, the operations underwent and the consequent pain, discomfort and suffering. Simultaneously, he has to suffer post­accident agony for whole life, including the amenities of life, which he can enjoy as a normal man but unable to do so on account of permanent disability. In the era of competition, he can perform better as a normal man but is unable to compete with others. Therefore, under the head "pain, shock and suffering", amount of compensation deserves to be granted."

A bank cannot retain title documents of a borrower's house after repayment of a loan, citing general lien on documents, merely because of pendency of another loan, the Bombay High Court has held.
 The bench partly-allowed a borrower's writ petition and directed Union Bank of India to handover title documents of his flat despite recovery proceedings, for another unpaid loan by the petition's company, pending before the DRT. 
 A division bench of Justice AS Chandurkar and Urmila Joshi Phalke observed that the bank's general lien on security (title document) under section 171 of the Indian Contracts Act, wouldn't apply after closure of the loan account. 
 This is because a general lien is impermissible in the absence of a contract. And closure of the loan account ends the contract, as well as, the bank-customer relationship.
The Court observed :
"...the material on record shows that the petitioner has cleared the entire dues in respect of loan which was obtained by him in his individual capacity to purchase the flat. The said loan transaction came to an end, therefore, the relationship of the banker and customer between the petitioner and the respondent in respect of the concerned loan account came to an end as he has repaid the amount. The relationship of banker and customer could not have been continued when the petitioner has repaid the amount on 31/05/2021 as the entire loan account is satisfied. The said transaction has been completed and there is no further relationship between the petitioner and the Bank as a banker and customer. In such circumstances, the contention of the respondent-Bank that it was exercising the right of general lien under Section 171 of the said Act is not sustainable"
 "Act of the bank is not justifiable. Hence, for the reasons recorded we have no hesitation to hold that the respondent-Bank has no right of general lien over the Title Deeds deposited by the petitioner after the entire loan amount was fully satisfied by the petitioner," the court observed. 
 Case
 The petitioner had borrowed Rs 21 lakhs from the bank payable in 300 instalments in 2011, and kept his flat as security. Subsequently, a company in which he was a director and personal guarantor had also taken a loan from the same bank. However, the company went into liquidation. 
 Due to financial crisis he decided to sell the flat and repay his personal loan and sought the bank's NOC for the same. After selling the flat, the borrower closed his personal loan account, but the bank refused to return his flat's title documents, which were meant to be handed over to the new flat purchaser. 
 Bank employees claimed they did not have permission from their superiors to release the documents, forcing the borrower to approached the Bombay High Court. 
 Before the court, the bank claimed that borrower should have approached the DRT. Moreover, the bank had also approached the DRT and for attachment of the petitioner's property regarding the second loan in which he is a guarantor.
 The bank said it was justified in applying the general lien clause u/s 171 of the Contracts Act and retaining the title documents for the DRT proceedings. 
 However, the bench disagreed. The bench said that the petitioner had cleared all his dues for the personal loan he had taken to purchase the flat. Through this, the loan transaction came to an end, therefore, the relationship of the banker and customer between the petitioner and the respondent in respect of the concerned loan account, had ended. 
 "In such circumstances, the contention of the respondent-Bank that it was exercising the right of general lien under Section 171 of the said Act is not sustainable," the court observed. 
 It, however, held that the bank was free to pursue its case before the Debt Recovery Tribunal but must release the petitioner's flat's title deeds handed over to the bank for the personal loan which had been repaid.
The Court observed :
"Admittedly, there was a relationship between the petitioner and the respondent as banker and customer. It is further clear from the pleadings that the Title Deed of the property in question was handed over to the respondent-Bank as a security. Admittedly, said loan amount is repaid by the petitioner. Though the respondent-Bank has submitted that there is another loan account against the petitioner and Bank has already moved an application to the Debt Recovery Tribunal for obtaining necessary orders, Bank is at liberty to move against the petitioner and other Directors to recover the said loan amount. Admittedly, said security was given against the loan amount which was already satisfied by the petitioner. In such a situation, it is not open for the respondent- Bank to continue to exercise its general lien for the security deposited with it especially when the entire amount was repaid. Such a general lien is not being exercised for a general balance of account as required under Section 171 of the said Act. Moreover, it would not be open for the Bank to exercise its right of general lien for the securities on the pretext of the banker and customer relationship. It cannot exercise such general lien under Section 171 of the said Act thus, there is no justification on the part of the respondent-Bank to retain the said documents by relying upon the provisions of Section 171 of the said Act"

The National Human Rights Commission, NHRC, India has taken suo-motu cognizance of the acquittal of a man in a rape case, twenty years after his conviction and has has observed that it seems to be a case of non-application of the Section 433 Cr PC. Significantly, this case is about a 23-year-old man (now 43), who was sentenced to life imprisonment by a trial court in a rape case and who has now been declared innocent by the Allahabad High Court after twenty years. It is important to note that the Allahabad High Court, in January 2021, came to his rescue,  after he suffered 20 years of incarceration in connection with a false rape case filed against him by a woman owing to an alleged land dispute. During this period, every member of his family had died. His conduct in the jail was always found good, but his application for furlough was not allowed to attend the cremation of his father. He was not even allowed to attend his brother's funeral. Section 433 of CrPC
 It may be noted that as per Section 433 CrPC, the Government can commute a sentence (of death, Life Imprisonment, rigorous imprisonment or simple imprisonment). Under this provision, the Sentence Review Board, under the law needs to reconsider review of the sentence awarded by the court, with a view to commuting the sentence. In this backdrop, the NHRC has stated,
 "In many such cases there may be prisoners older than 75 years of age dying in the jails, which clearly depicts ineffectiveness of the Sentence Review Board. The Commission media report has observed that the contents thereof, if true, amount to violation of human rights of the victim." Accordingly, the NHRC has issued notices to the Chief Secretary and Director General of Police, Uttar Pradesh calling for a detailed report in the matter. Further, it has been directed that the report must include:-

The response is expected within 6 weeks. About the case in brief
 The man was accused of rape, criminal intimidation and sexual exploitation of a woman belonging to Scheduled Caste in 1999, and during the trial of the case by a lower court in Lalitpur District, he was found guilty. In the year 2003, he was moved to Agra Central Jail where his conduct was always good. In the year 2005, he decided to challenge the verdict of the lower court and approached the High Court. After completing a period of fourteen years, the victim moved Mercy Plea and the prison authorities stepped in. The State Legal Services Authorities helped him in preferring an appeal in the High Court and on 28.01.2021, a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court declared him, not guilty. The High Court in its Judgment, observed that the FIR in the matter was lodged three days late and there were no injuries on the private parts of the woman, who was said to have been thrashed.

The Supreme Court has constituted a committee of experts to submit suggestions to facilitate access to justice and timely filing of appeals/petitions by convicts through legal service institutions.
The Committee has been asked to submit a report within four weeks "with regard to digitization, translation and electronic transmission of records to facilitate access to justice and timely filing of appeals/SLPs by the convicts, by utilizing the Information and Communication Technology tools".
The Committee comprises :
Secretary (Ministry of Home Affairs), Government of India, Director General, National Informatics Centre, Member (Process), E-Committee, Supreme Court of India and Member Secretary, NALSA
A bench comprising Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, Justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran passed the order on January 19.
"We have noticed that in the special leave petitions filed by Supreme Court Legal Services Committee (SCLSC) on behalf of the convicts, there is an inordinate delay which becomes difficult to condone. Needless to say, the situation brings about a lack of even-handedness in dealing with matters of condonation of delay. We see no reason why these delays should continue to occur particularly with the availability of tools provided by information and communication technology which are easily available", the bench observed in the order.
The bench had appointed Advocate Vibha Datta Makhija as amicus curiae in the matter. She submitted a report on January 15 in consultation with the SCLSC on measures to curb the delay. 
"Valuable as that report is, we consider it appropriate to constitute a Committee comprising of certain experts who would examine all the suggestions and responses which may be received by it from the High Courts as well as the other stakeholders", the bench said.
The Committee has been asked to examine the report of the amicus as well as the responses of the High Courts.
The bench further observed :
"We have also gone through the Module and the Note dated16.10.2019 as per the report for timely filing of appeals/SLPs of convicts though the Legal Services Institutions. We therefore direct the High Courts to submit their responses to the Committee through their Registrars General within two weeks. The Committee shall submit its report within two weeks' thereafter. The Secretary General of this Court shall coordinate meetings of the Committee".

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently decreed a divorce plea filed by a man after holding that the act of the wife of filing false and frivolous cases against her husband amounted to cruelty.
However, keeping in view the requirements of the wife, the bench of Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Nidhi Gupta further granted permanent alimony of Rs. 10 Lakh to the wife as a full and final settlement of all disputes between the parties.
"Before parting, though we have held that the acts of the respondent-wife amount to cruelty against the appellant-husband, we are, however, not oblivious to her requirements. It has come on record that the appellant has been paying interim maintenance under section 125 CRPC at Rs.2500/- per month, and Rs.3000 per month was granted by the trial court under section 24 of the HMA. In these circumstances, we consider it just to direct that the husband shall pay to the wife a sum of INR 10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakhs only) as one-time permanent alimony as full and final settlement of all disputes between the parties," the Court ordered (emphasis supplied).
The case in brief
The Husband/appellant moved a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 before the family court seeking dissolution of his marriage with the respondent/wife on the ground of cruelty. The same was dismissed by the Additional District Judge, Tarn Taran in May 2017. Challenging the same, he moved to the High Court.
He submitted that he got married to the respondent/wife in the year 2009-2010. No child was born out of their wedlock and since the very beginning, his wife did not want to live in the matrimonial house along with his parents and wished to live separately.
It was further his case that his wife did not perform her matrimonial duties and would pick up quarrels on trifle matters and would insult his parents and that she had a "venom-oozing tongue". She even threatened to involve the appellant and his family members in a false dowry case.
It was also stated that in October 2013, the father of the respondent took her away and she took all her belongings and gold ornaments with her and never came back. Thereafter, she filed a case against him and his family members under Sections 406, 498-A, and 120-B IPC, however, they all were acquitted later on.
On the other hand, the wife alleged that she was ill-treated and beaten up by her in-laws for more dowry articles and when she was left with no alternative but to register the abovesaid FIR against them, she filed a case against them. She further stated that she was thrown out of the matrimonial home in October 2013.
High Court's observations
At the outset, the Court took note of the fact that the appellant-husband and his family members had been acquitted in the case filed against them by the wife of the appellant. The Court also noted that the Trial Court had returned very categoric findings holding that the wife entirely failed to prove its case.
In view of this, the Court further remarked thus:
"In our view, once criminal litigation is initiated between the parties it leads to a point of no return. And if it is a false case filed by the wife merely to harass and humiliate the husband and his family, then the resultant bitterness rarely leaves any room or reason for reconciliation"
Further, the Court also took note of landmark rulings of the Supreme Court to note that if the wife files a false complaint against her spouse, it amounts to cruelty and is sufficient ground for divorce. 
Thus, holding that the wife's act amounted to cruelty, the Court went ahead to note of the fact that the parties have been living separately since October 2013, and their conduct of the parties evidence that there are irreconcilable differences between them, rendering the marriage, a mere legal fiction. Consequently, the appeal was allowed.

The High Court of Delhi has held that the Court cannot grant a relief which is final in nature in an application under Section 9 of the A&C Act.
 The bench of Justice Chandra Dhari Singh held that relief contemplated under Section 9 of the Act is only interim in nature I.e., ‘in the intervening time’ or ‘provisional’ and it has to be in aid of the enforcement of the award and subject to the final relief given in the award. The Court refused to injunct the respondent from withholding the payment on account of alleged delay as the Court observed that the relief claimed by the petitioner was final in nature as it was neither subject to any award or in aid of any enforcement. 
 The Court further reiterated that the court cannot either enforce an award, in the garb of interim relief, under Section 9 of the Act or grant an interim relief which is beyond the reliefs granted under the award. 
 Facts
 The parties entered into a concession agreement dated 31.03.2006. A dispute arose between the parties related to the terms of the agreement regarding the renewal of the work every five years. Accordingly, the dispute was referred to arbitration and an award dated 14.01.2020 was passed wherein the relief claimed by the petitioner was partially allowed. The award has been put to challenge by both the parties and is pending consideration before the Court. 
 Thereafter, the petitioner raised an invoice for the payment of 22nd Annuity. Another dispute arose between the parties when the respondent deducted an amount from the invoice on the ground of delay in completing the 2nd renewal work. Aggrieved with the deductions made, the petitioner filed the application under Section 9 of the Act praying for refund of the amount deducted. 
 Contention of the Parties
 The petitioner sought refund on the following grounds:
 The deductions made by the respondent is against the award dated 14.01.2020. The petitioner cannot be faulted for the delay in the completion of the 2nd renewal work as the Coordinate bench of the High Court, on an interlocutory application moved in the challenge petition, had stayed the operation of the direction of the arbitral tribunal directing the petitioner to carry out the renewal work. Prior to that, the Arbitral tribunal had itself stayed the operation of the second renewal work, therefore, the operation of the 2nd renewal work was stalled, firstly, at the directions of the tribunal and then at the directions of the Court, thus, no cause of action has arisen for the respondent to levy damages on the petitioner for the alleged delay. Moreover, there is no clause in the agreement to permit the respondent to make deductions from the annuity payments, also the agreement provides that notwithstanding any dispute between the parties, the annuity payments are to be released in full. 
 The respondent opposed the petition on the following grounds:
 The petitioner is claiming a final relief in the form of release of the payment withheld by the respondent. The relief is final in nature as it is not subject to any prospective arbitration nor in aid of enforcement of the award. The arbitral tribunal has directed the petitioner to complete the 2nd renewal work and that finding of the arbitral tribunal has not yet been set aside, therefore, the award remains in operation, thus, the respondent can impose damages on the petitioner for any delay. The interim order of the tribunal stands vacated in view of the final award. 
 Analysis by the Court
 Firstly, the Court dealt with the preliminary objection regarding the nature of relief. The Court referred to Section 9 of the Act and several judgments by the Courts to decide the nature of relief that can be claimed and granted by the Court exercising powers under Section 9 of the Act. 
 The Court held that Section 9 provides for interim relief and the word interim here means ‘in the interim period’ or ‘provisional’. The Court held that Section 9 is to be understood by ‘Literal Rule of Interpretation’, thus, the relief can only be interim in nature and not a final relief. 
 The Court also observed that the Court cannot grant an interim relief that has the effect of rendering the final relief as infructuous, thus, the interim relief must be made subject to the final relief. Also, when the award is passed but before it is enforceable under Section 39 of the Act, the scope of interim relief must be limited to the final relief granted in the award.
 The Court observed that the relief that the petitioner is claiming is in the nature of final relief as it is not claiming refund of the amount so withheld subject to the proceedings under Section 34 or the enforcement of the award but in the nature of a permanent order. It observed as under:
 “Although the petitioner is seeking an order on the prayers sought under Section 9(1) of the Arbitration Act, however, is attempting to obtain a permanent relief of release of amount of Rs. 12,56,72,430/- in its favour which it alleges has been wrongfully, illegally, and arbitrarily deducted. It is not the case of the petitioner that the amount to be released in its favour is merely a provisional payment necessary for sustenance or immediate operations etc., required only till the disposal of proceedings or enforcement of Award, which shall be returned or reimbursed to the respondent after the proceedings under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act are concluded. Rather, the petitioner is seeking a relief in the nature of a permanent order by praying for directions to the respondent to remit the amount deducted by it once and for all.”
 Accordingly, the Court dismissed the petition.

The Calcutta High Court has held that th Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is "State" under Article 12 of the Constitution and thus, a writ petition is maintainable against it.
 The judgment delivered by a Single Bench of Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya further states that even private banks cannot seek refuge of being non-State actors, for the purpose of challenging maintainability of a writ petition against them, as their functions pertain to discharge of public duties.
 The Single Bench ruled,
 "Since the Reserve Bank of India is an instrumentality of the State, it comes squarely within the meaning of "State" as contemplated in Article 12 of the Constitution. Thus, the writ petition is maintainable."
 It added,
 "the functions discharged by the respondent no.4-Bank [IndusInd Bank] are of a public nature and, as such, pertain to the discharge of public duties."
 The Bench refused to apply the principle laid down by the Supreme Court in Federal Bank Limited v. Sagar Thomas & Ors., (2003) 10 SCC 733, that a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution is not maintainable against private banks.
 The instant case pertained to a dispute between the Petitioner, a MSME and the IndusInd Bank with respect to refund of processing fee paid by the former, to the latter, pursuant to a prospective loan facility.
 As per the Petitioner, the Bank had assured that in case by any reason the sanction did not go through from its end, it would refund the fee. However, when the Petitioner sought refund of the processing fees against delay and non-receipt of final sanction letter, the Bank claimed that the processing fee was non-refundable.
 Subsequently, the RBI also intimated the petitioner that as per its understanding, the processing fees were non-refundable.
 It is against this communication that the Petitioner had approached the High Court.
 At the outset, the Bench observed that the question raised by the Petitioner in the present writ petition is not restricted to the grievance of the petitioner solely, but also has a wider connotation insofar as the liabilities of banks in respect of refund of processing fees is concerned.
 On a perusal of the entire material on record, the Bench same to a finding that the IndusInd Bank, while discharging its public duty which is within the domain of the State to discharge, acted de hors its own promise of refund on which the petitioner had acted.
 It thus held that such actions on part of the Bank debars it by the principle of estoppel from refusing to refund the processing fees. It observed,
 "The Bank cannot now resile from its stand, which is revealed from a conjoint reading of the in-principle sanction letter and the e-mail asking for processing fees, that the entire processing fees would be refunded in the event the sanction did not go through from the end of the respondent no.4-Bank "by any reason"."

 Case Title: M/s Pearson Drums & Barrels Pvt. Ltd. v. General Manager, Consumer Education & Protection Cell of Reserve Bank of India & Ors.
 Read Order

The Allahabad High Court has observed that a piece of false information regarding the education qualification of an election candidate can't be termed a 'corrupt practice' within the meaning of subsection (2) or (4) of section 123 R.P. Act.
 The bench of Justice Raj Beer Singh further observed that the information regarding the educational qualifications of a candidate is not a vital and useful piece of information to the voter and thus, it cannot be said that any inconsistency or error in the affidavit of a candidate regarding candidate's educational qualification would amount to corrupt practice.
 The Court also held that concealment of electricity dues or housing loans by a candidate would also not be termed as a corrupt practice within the meaning of section 123 of the R.P. Act.
 The case in brief 
 In the month of February 2017, UP State elections were wherein the petitioner (Anugrah Narayan Singh/Indian National Congress) as well as the respondent (Harsh Vardhan Bajpayee/BJP) contested election from the 262 Allahabad City North constituency and the respondent was declared elected. 
 Challenging his elections, the petitioner filed the instant election petition under section 80/81 of the Representation of the People Act on the ground that he concealed the facts about the pending electricity dues and other liabilities and he also furnished false information regarding his educational qualifications and thus, the same amount to corrupt practice.
 During the pendency of the election petition, the Legislative Assembly came to be dissolved in the month of February/ March 2022 after the term of five years was over, in view of this, the respondent filed an application seeking a direction that the election petition may be dismissed as infructuous.
 However, the counsel for the petitioner argued that since the respondent had committed corrupt practice within the meaning of sections 123(2) and 123(4) of the RP Act and thus, the election petition must be proceeded further, as the respondent may entail several disqualifications including a bar for contesting an election for a period of six years.
 Court's observations
 Taking into account several landmark rulings of the Supreme Court, the High Court observed that when the term of the disputed election has expired and thereafter, fresh election has taken place and if the allegations made by the petitioner do not amount to any corrupt practice, then such an election petition could be dismissed.
 In the instant case, the Court noted that the charges against the respondent (BJP candidate) was that he had failed to disclose his liabilities as well as a correct educational qualification in his affidavit of nomination, and thus, he had interfered in the free exercise of the electoral rights of the electors.
 However, the Court observed that merely because the said electrical connection is installed in the property owned by the respondent, it would not be sufficient to show that the respondent has concealed the alleged liability. 
 The Court also noted that no such document was shown by the petitioner to show that a recovery certificate was issued against the respondent.
 "In the present case, there is no documentary evidence that the said electricity connection was in the name of the respondent or that the alleged recovery certificate was issued against the applicant. There is no such finding [in the apex Court's decision in Kisan Shankar Kathore v. Arun Dattatray Sawant And Ors., SCC 14 (2014) 162] that concealment of electricity dues would amount to corrupt practice contemplated under section 123 of the R.P. Act. Even on the premises of the said case law the allegation regarding nondisclosure of electricity dues and loan amount would not amount to corrupt practice," the Court further remarked.
 Regarding the contention of the petitioner that false information was furnished by the respondent regarding his educational qualification, the Court took into account the Apex Court's rulings in the cases of Peoples Union for Civil Liberties V UOI AIR 2003 SC 2363 as well as Kuldeep Nayar And Ors. v. Union of India And Ors., 2006(7) SCC 1, and observed thus:
 "…the anomalies regarding educational qualification shown in the affidavit of the respondent or to say even false information regarding the education of the respondent, can hardly be termed as 'corrupt practice' within the meaning of sub section (2) or (4) of section 123 R.P. Act. Further, for the sake of argument even if it is assumed that the respondent does not hold the degree of MBA, which was shown by him in his affidavit filed in the nomination of election to the said constituency in the year 2012, it cannot be a ground hold that it would constitute a corrupt practice in respect of next election in the year 2017."
 Against this backdrop, noting that since the allegations of the corrupt practices were not proved thus, the election petition was liable to be dismissed as having been rendered infructuous, the Court dismissed the plea.

Noting that the teacher, who moved court in 2021, was now vaccinated, Justice Prathiba M Singh permitted her to make a representation to the concerned authority for service benefits and directed that the decision on the same be taken within 30 days.
The petitioner is a lecturer of history subject in the Government Girls Senior Secondary School, under Delhi Government’s Directorate of Education. 
The court relied on the judgment of Supreme Court in Jacob Puliyel v. Union of India & Ors wherein it was observed that personal autonomy of an individual encompasses the right to refuse to undergo any medical treatment in the sphere of individual health.
It also relied on the order passed by a coordinate bench in Narendar Kumar v. Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi wherein the Delhi Government submitted that in view of the Supreme Court ruling, no employer was insisting upon compulsory vaccination and that all employees had been permitted to re-join their posts without the stipulation of vaccination being mandated. 
The said order was also taken note of in other pleas moved by similarly placed individuals. 
Perusing the said orders, Justice Singh observed:
“In view of the above-mentioned orders relating to similar fact situations, the present petition, along with all pending applications, is disposed of with the direction that Covid-19 vaccination cannot be insisted upon by the employer, in terms of the various orders passed above.”
As the petitioner’s counsel submitted that the representation regarding service benefits to the teacher was made on June 14 last year, the court directed that the copy of the same be forwarded with a fresh covering letter to the authorities within one week. 
“A decision on the same shall be taken within four weeks by the Respondents. All remedies are left open,” the court said. 
Title: ISHA v. STATE (NCT OF DELHI) & ORS.

The Delhi High Court has observed that information relating to Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) and senior personnel of Indian Navy would not be liable to be disclosed under the Right to Information Act, 2005. 
Justice Prathiba M Singh upheld an order passed by Chief Information Commission (CIC) rejecting an RTI application filed by a commander in the Indian Navy. He had sought the information after denial of promotion to the post of Captain in 2014, 2015 and 2016.
Jagjit Pal Singh Virk in his RTI application dated October 18, 2018 sought information about his ACR Marks and the value judgement marks. He had also sought copies of merit lists prepared by the promotion boards and other information.
The Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) of Indian Navy refused to provide the information stating that the copy of ACRs of the persons in Armed Forces are confidential in nature and the same cannot be disclosed even after retirement. 
Upholding the order passed by CIC, Justice Singh observed:
“In the opinion of this Court, the information sought in the present petition would not be liable to be disclosed, owing to the nature of the information i.e., relating to senior personnel in the Navy. The CIC’s order does not warrant any interference.”
The decision of CIC was earlier upheld by First Appellate Authority of the Ministry of Defence on May 21, 2019 observing that it is in the interest of the Armed Forces and the nation that the merit list is not known to an individual officer because if the merit lists are divulged after every Promotion Board (PB) or Selection Board (SB), the officer who is amongst the last to make it in the PB shall be demotivated as they will come to know that it is unlikely for them to get promoted to the next higher rank. 
The petitioner’s counsel submitted that Virk is entitled to know the marks awarded to him as he was not promoted.
On the other hand, Central Government’s counsel submitted that the petitioner had already challenged the decision of denial of promotion to him before the Armed Forces Tribunal which has upheld the same. The Supreme Court has also upheld the decision in December 2018, the court was told.
Dismissing the plea, the court noted that the information sought by the petitioner relates to various aspects of the Promotion Board, details of the profiles and Virk’s position on the merit list. The data sought regarding his promotion or appraisals could include the ACRs and sensitive information relating to the other candidates, who were considered for promotion. 
“A perusal of both of the orders of AFT and the Supreme Court shows that relevant records of the Review Promotion Board have been produced before both AFT as also the Supreme Court. Further, the CPIO has clearly taken the stand that the copies of the ACR cannot be provided and only grading given by IO, RO and SRO can be provided only 3 after the retirement in regard of DoP&T OM No. 10/202016-IR as also in the larger public interest,” the court said. 
Perusing the stand of the CPIO, CIC’s observations and the judgments of the AFT and Supreme Court, the court did not find any legal ground to interfere with the impugned order. 
Title: JAGJIT PAL SINGH VIRK v. UNION OF INDIA & ANR.

The Delhi High Court has held that all the candidates belonging to reserved categories as notified by a Presidential Order in any state or union territory would be entitled to reservation benefit in Delhi subordinate services. 
"If a candidate is able to furnish a certificate of belonging to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe – which may otherwise be issued only by the competent authority where such a candidate is ordinarily resident – he cannot be denied the benefit of reservation as specified under the Notification." 
A division bench of Justice Vibhu Bakhru and Justice Amit Mahajan was dealing with a bunch of pleas filed by candidates, belonging to Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) category, who had appeared for interview for the post of "Court Attendant/Room Attendant (Group-C)" in the High Court but were not recommended for appointment for not submitting any proof of being ordinarily resident of Delhi. 
The question which arose for consideration was whether the candidates were ineligible for appointment under the reserved category in the High Court's establishment on the ground that their caste certificates were issued outside Delhi.
The court noted that in terms of the notification for recruitment by high court, applications were invited from all the citizens without any qualification as to their place of residence. 
It also noted that it was not the case of the court's establishment that persons belonging to SC and ST category of another state were not eligible to apply. 
"Concededly, there is no requirement for a general category candidate to establish that he is an ordinarily resident of Delhi for qualifying for the said appointment. The requirement for a candidate to be an ordinarily resident of Delhi has been carved out only in respect of candidates, who claim reservation by virtue of belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, as notified in relation to a State other than National Capital Territory of Delhi," the court said. 
Relying on various judgments of the Supreme Courts, the court said a person who belongs to a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe in another State is not entitled to benefits extended to the reserved categories in another State as they would not belong to Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe in relation to that State. 
"Insofar as the services under the National Capital Territory of Delhi are concerned, the decision in the case of Bir Singh v. Delhi Jal Board & Ors. and Deepak Kumar & Ors. v. District and Sessions Judge, Delhi and Ors. hold that the rule of pan-India reservation would be applicable. Thus, all candidates belonging to reserved categories notified by the Presidential Order in any State or Union Territory would be entitled to benefit of reservation in the subordinate services in the National Capital Territory of Delhi," it said. 
Allowing the pleas, the court directed its establishment to consider appointment of the petitioner candidates to the advertised posts under the quota for the reserved category candidates without insisting on them being ordinarily residents of Delhi. 
This is subject to the petitioners otherwise qualifying for such appointment in the order of merit, the bench added.
Title: ASHU & ORS v. THE REGISTRAR GENERAL, HIGH COURT OF DELHI AND ORS.

The Bombay High Court allowed a man’s application seeking transfer of domestic violence proceedings from the magistrate’s court to the family court, where he has filed a divorce petition. The court said it would not be inconvenient for the wife as both are in the same city.
Justice Amit Borkar held that there is a possibility of conflicting verdicts and transfer will reduce the burden of one court.
“There is the possibility of conflicting verdicts by two courts, and transfer will reduce the burden of one Court resulting in saving of judicial time; and moreover, the transfer of proceedings will not cause inconvenience to the wife as she will not have to travel outside Pune, therefore, for the aforesaid reasons, in my opinion, both miscellaneous civil applications deserve to be allowed”.
The husband claimed that primary evidence in his divorce case and his wife’s case under Protection of Women From Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (DV Act) is the same. The efficacy of cross examination would be undermined if both are conducted separately, he argued.
Advocate Abhinav Chandrachud for the wife relied on Abhijeet Prabhakar Jail v. Manisha Abhijeet Jail and submitted that the transfer would take away her statutory right to appeal under section 29 of the Act and also take away her right of speedy disposal. 
It was also submitted that subsequent judgments of the High Court are "in ignorance" of Abhijeet Prabhakar Jail and hence the question should be referred to a larger bench. 
Advocate Abhijeet Sarwate with Advocate Ajinkya Udane for the husband submitted that it is a consistent view of the court that the proceedings under DV Act can be transferred to the Family Court
Justice Borkar said that it has consistently been held that proceedings under the DV Act can be transferred to the family court as it can effectively try and grant the relief sought. The family courts are empowered to deal with the reliefs under sections 18 to 22 of the DV Act, the court said, while referring to the precdednt. 
In Abhijeet Prabhakar Jail, the court had rejected the husband’s transfer application on four grounds, two of which were that transferring the proceedings will take away the right of speedy justice under the DV Act and, the transfer would take away the statutory right of appeal available to the wife.
The court said that only the ratio decidendi constitutes a binding president. The court applied the inversion test to find out the ratio in Abhijeet Prabhakar Jail case.
The court said that even if the reason that transferring proceedings would take away the right of speedy justice is taken away, the single judge would still have arrived at the same decision based on the other reasons. Hence that reason does not constitute the ratio of the judgement, it added.
The court relied on Sandip Mrinmoy Chakrabarty v. Reshita Sandip Chakrabarty in which the division bench concluded that the family court appeal challenging common order arising out of proceedings under the DV Act and Family Courts Act would be maintainable.
Thus, the court said that the judgement in Abhijeet Prabhakar Jail does not hold ground in view of the division bench judgement in Sandip Mrinmoy Chakrabarty.
Since it is the consistent view of various single judges of the court that proceedings under the DV act can be transferred to the family court, the court said that it is unnecessary to refer the matter to a larger bench.
“The consistent view of various Single Judges of this Court that proceedings under the DV Act can be transferred to the Family Court constrains me to hold it is unnecessary to refer the matter to the Larger Bench because the position of law on the point appears to have been settled by the aforesaid decisions.”

While upholding the disciplinary action against an erring police official, the Madras High Court heavily criticized the manner in which his fellow officials had given false statements before the trial court in the connected criminal case.

While upholding the disciplinary action against an erring police official, the Madras High Court heavily criticized the manner in which his fellow officials had given false statements before the trial court in the connected criminal case. 
Justice SM Subramaniam remarked that police officials making false or incorrect statements before the criminal courts could be construed as "misconduct" under the Government Service Conduct Rules.
Contrary to the mahazer prepared and in violation of the Government Servants Conduct Rules, making a false or incorrect statement before the Criminal Court of Law is also the misconduct under the Government Servant Conduct Rules.....The respondents have to consider the manner of functioning of the Police Department Officials in the Control Room and initiate all appropriate actions to ensure that the departmental officials maintain good conduct at all circumstances and even before the Courts of Law while deposing or giving statements. 
The present petition was filed by a Grade I Police Constable against whom an order of punishment of postponement of increment for 3 years without cumulative effect was imposed by the Disciplinary Authority, which was confirmed by the Appellate Authority. 
The case against the petitioner was that while attending duty in the Police Control Room on 14.11.2012, he was in a drunken mood and abused Special Sub Inspector of Police on duty. 
Though the colleagues in the Control Room pacified the writ petitioner, the writ petitioner did not relent and therefore, the writ petitioner was taken to Government Hospital and drunkenness certificate was obtained and a criminal case was registered under Sections 294(b), 323, 353, 506(ii) IPC read with Section 4(1)(j) of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act. 
Simultaneously departmental disciplinary proceedings were initiated under Rule 3(b) of Tamil Nadu Police Subordinate Service (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1955 was also initiated.
The criminal case ended with an order of acquittal whereas the disciplinary authority proceeded with the departmental proceedings and conducted an enquiry and thereafter passed final orders on 05.02.2015 imposing the said penalty. An appeal against this order was subsequently rejected by the DIG.
The petitioner contended that the Disciplinary Authority had failed to take into consideration the order of acquittal passed by the competent criminal court and also erred in holding that the charges are held proved. When the charges against the Disciplinary authority and the criminal court were similar, the order of acquittal made by the competent criminal court was to be taken into consideration for the purpose of exonerating the writ petitioner from the departmental disciplinary proceedings, it was argued.
The court however disagreed with this contention and emphasized that the proceedings before the disciplinary authorities was different from that before a criminal court.
The preponderance of probabilities are expected to punish an employee and a moral turpitude is sufficient to punish an employee. Thus, the misconduct under the Conduct Rules and the procedures contemplated in the disciplinary proceedings, cannot be compared with the procedures to be followed in criminal proceedings before the Criminal Court of Law. Both the procedures are distinct and different. Thus the ground seeking exoneration from the departmental disciplinary proceedings based on the acquittal order by the Criminal Court of Law is untenable. 
The respondent authority contended that the allegations against the petitioner were serious. They also drew the attention of the court to the manner in which the witnesses had deposed before the court. The witnesses, who were all police officials, had turned hostile and acted contrary to the prosecution case.
The court took note of this fact and opined that the higher officials of the Police Department had to take a serious view of the matter.
"The manner in which the Police Department officials deposed before the Criminal Court reveals that they acted unbecoming of the public officials. They have joined together and decided to dilute the criminal proceedings in order to help the accused persons. Such a conduct of the public servant under no circumstances be appreciated by this Court."
The court also noted that there was no infirmity in the procedure followed during the disciplinary proceedings. There was also no excessiveness regarding the quantum of punishment. Thus, the court was not inclined to consider the grounds raised by the petitioner and dismissed the petition.

The Allahabad High Court on Tuesday granted anticipatory bail to a man named, Mohammad Kaif who has been accused of trying to incite religious sentiments by raising anti-national slogans during Anti-CAA protests.
The Bench of Justice Raj Beer Singh considered the settled principle of law regarding anticipatory bail along with the submissions of the counsel for the parties, nature of the accusation, the role of the applicant, and all attending facts and circumstances of the case, and opined that a case for anticipatory bail was made out.
Essentially, Kaif had moved the court seeking anticipatory bail in a case under Sections 147, 148, 149, 188, 153A, 298, 304, 332, 353 I.P.C. and Section 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act.
It was argued by the counsel for the applicant, Nabi Ullah that the applicant is innocent and he had an apprehension that he may be arrested in the above-mentioned case, whereas there is no credible evidence against him. 
It was further submitted that the applicant had no criminal antecedents and that no coercive process had been issued against the applicant so far. It was also submitted that applicant is not named in FIR and that the FIR was lodged against 16 named and some unknown persons alleging that despite proclamation under Section 144 Cr.P.C., accused persons have tried to incite religious sentiments by raising anti-national slogans. 
It was submitted that the applicant had been falsely implicated in this case during investigation merely on the basis of suspicion and that no specific role had been assigned to the applicant. 
It was also submitted that similarly placed co-accused Ashraf and Ashraf Ali Khan have already been granted anticipatory bail by coordinating Benches of the Court. Lastly, the applicant undertook to co-operate during investigation and trial and to appear as and when required by the investigating agency or Court. 
While granting him bail, the Court referred to Apex Court's ruling in the case of Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre v. State of Maharashtra, (2011) 1 SCC 694, wherein it was held that while deciding anticipatory bail, the Court must consider nature and gravity of accusation, the antecedent of accused, the possibility of accused to flee from justice and that Court must evaluate entire available material against the accused carefully and that the exact role of the accused has also to be taken into consideration
The Court allowed the anticipatory bail plea on his furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/- with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Station House Officer of the police station.

The Bombay High Court has granted bail to the owner of a building in Mumbai's Malwani area which collapsed last year, killing 9 of his own family members.
 Justice Bharati Dangre, while granting bail to Mohammed Rafique Siddiqui earlier this month, observed, "The applicant, in any case, cannot be attributed a rash and negligent act, resulting into the collapse of the building where he himself has lost his family members. He may face the consequences of the trial when the prosecution will establish and connect him to the grave and negligent act. However, at present, in the wake of the nature of the offence and the evidence collected by the prosecution and compiled in the charge-sheet, the applicant cannot be continued in detention and deserve his release on bail."
 A ground plus two storey structure collapsed on June 10 last year in Mumbai's western suburb Malad, killing 11 people of which 8 were children. Of the 12 who lost their lives, 9 belonged to Siddiqui's family – Siddiqui's wife, his brother and brother's wife and six minor children. The structure was only 8-years old at that time.
 An FIR was registered under various sections of IPC pertaining to causing death and grievous injuries by negligence and the contractor Ramzan Nabi Shaikh was arrested the same day. Shaikh's bail application was rejected in July last year on the basis of gravity of the accusation and the material compiled in the charge-sheet showing that he was responsible for carrying out the construction of the building which was found to be of inferior quality.
 Siddiqui surrendered at the time of filing of the charge sheet on August 9 last year and has been in custody since then. His bail application was rejected once last year.
 Advocate Mubin Solkar, appearing for Siddiqui, submitted before the High Court that the structure had developed cracks due to Nisarg cyclone and Siddiqui had got the repair work done immediately after this was brought to his notice.
 On this aspect Justice Dangre noted, "Statement of one Mohd Junaid Mohd Javed Siddiqui to that effect is recorded and compiled in the charge-sheet. Statement of Munir Shaikh (complainant) is also on similar lines, where he stated that when the attention of the applicant/occupant of the said house was brought to the cracks developed in the building, he informed him that he had taken appropriate steps and confirmed that the building is stable."
 The court ordered his release on bail on furnishing P R bond for Rs 25,000 with one or two sureties of the like amount. He has been directed to not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing the facts to Court or any Police Officer, and to not tamper with evidence. He has also been asked to report to the concerned police station on the first Monday of trimester. 
 Case Title : Mohammad Rafique Mohammad Saleem Siddiqui v The State of Maharashtra

The Supreme Court observed that, a Court would not be justified in allowing the amendment of plaint if the nature of the suit is likely to be changed.
The bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna also observed that the Plaintiffs cannot be permitted to join any party as a defendant who may not be necessary and / or proper parties at all on the ground that the plaintiffs is the dominus litus.
In this case, the High Court of Delhi in Commercial Suits under Order 1 Rule 10 and Order 6 Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, permitted the original plaintiff to amend the respective suits and also ordered impleadment of mortgagees (Banks). The plaintiffs in the suit had sought a decree of declaration that the license in favour of the plaintiff in respect of shop/ premises is irrevocable and perpetual and the purported revocation of the License by the defendant is illegal, void and bad in the eyes of law. A decree was also sought for a declaration declaring that the plaintiff has unfettered right to occupy and use the said premises / shop under the irrevocable license till the documents of transfer / conveyance are executed by the defendant. The plaintiff proposed to amend the suit challenging various mortgages created by the defendant hotel, in favour of certain banks.
Assailing these orders, the appellant contended that the impleadment and amendment applications are mala fide filed only to circumvent adjudication pending Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On the other hand, respondents contended that at the stage of allowing the amendment the Court should not be concerned with the merits and demerits of such amendments.
The Apex Court bench noted that the High Court while allowing the amendment application in exercise of powers under Order 6 Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure has not properly appreciated the fact and / or considered the fact that as such, by granting such an amendment and permitting plaintiffs to amend the plaints incorporating the prayer clause to declare the respective charges / mortgages void ab­initio, the nature of the suits will be changed.
"As per the settled proposition of law, if, by permitting plaintiffs to amend the plaint including a prayer clause nature of the suit is likely to be changed, in that case, the Court would not be justified in allowing the amendment. It would also result in misjoinder of causes of action.....The principle that the plaintiffs is the dominus litus shall be applicable only in a case where parties sought to be added as defendants are necessary and / or proper parties. Plaintiffs cannot be permitted to join any party as a defendant who may not be necessary and / or proper parties at all on the ground that the plaintiffs is the dominus litus"
The court therefore held that in a suit challenging revocation of the respective licenses, the plaintiffs cannot be permitted to challenge the respective mortgages / charges created on the entire premises as void ab­initio.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently observed that false assertions should be discouraged by parties while they come tot he Court seeking reliefs. The Court observed thus in connection with a case of a woman who hid her job details and her earnings in a maintenance plea filed by her under Section 125 of CrPC.
The bench of Justice Jasjit Singh Bedi observed that the practice of making false assertions in court ought to be discouraged because the dignity and sanctity of the court is undermined by such conduct of a party to a lis.
The case in brief
Essentially, the petitioner-woman Ritu had moved the High Court against the order of the Court of Additional Principal Judge (Family Court), Ambala ordering an inquiry against the petitioner into an offence under Section 191 IPC punishable under Section 193 for concealing her income while seeking maintenance from her husband.
During her deposition before the court, she maintained the same stand of having no income but when she was confronted with the record relating to her job, she admitted that she was working as an Assistant Professor on a monthly salary of Rs.28,000/- per month. 
The petitioner took up the job on July 3, 2017 whereas she had moved an application under Section 125 Cr.PC on July 26, 2017 whereing she had stated that she does not have any source of income or property to support herself or her daughter.
Her husband moved the court below arguing that the wife was legally bound to tell the truth but she made a false statement in her testimony, that she was not holding any job which she knew to be false. 
Therefore, holding that she had given false evidence in the proceedings under Section 125 Cr.PC, the Court below came to the conclusion that it was expedient in the interest of justice that an inquiry should be made for having committed an offence under Sections 191 IPC punishable under Section 193 IPC. 
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court opined that a petition under Section 125 Cr.PC is filed by a person who is unable to maintain herself or her children on account of lack of sufficient means and thus, the Court added, it becomes the foremost duty of the party claiming maintenance to disclose to the Court her actual financial status so as to enable the Court to come to a conclusion as to the quantum of maintenance to be paid, if any.
Further, reverting to the facts of the case, the Court noted that the petitioner is working an Assistant Professor and is a highly educated person and still, at no stage of proceedings uptill her cross examination, did she disclose that she was employed including when her application for interim maintenance was decided and Rs.5000/- was awarded to her.
"Assuming that the said fact was missing in her petition under Section 125 Cr.PC, the Court could have been informed during the course of proceedings that there had been change of circumstances regarding her obtaining employment. However, as has already been mentioned above, no such information was furnished and only the cross examination revealed her job and consequent salary. Thus it can safely be said that the possibility of her conviction was high and her actions were certainly deliberate and conscious to obtain maintenance," the Court held as it dismissed the plea moved by the woman-petitioner
Case title - Smt. Ritu @ Ridhima & Anr. v. Sandeep Singh Sangwan
Case citation:  (PH) 44

The Kerala High Court recently observed the wife not being able to lead a peaceful life in matrimonial home, in view of the particular circumstances there, may not always be 'cruelty' but could be a reasonable ground to deny 'joint residence' and same does not grant the husband any discretion to deny payment of maintenance. 
Justice A. Badharudeen, while dealing with an argument that wife may not be legally entitled to get maintenance from husband after leaving matrimonial home voluntarily, said:
... when a party seeks divorce on the ground of cruelty, there shall be sufficient pleadings alleging cruelty, and evidence to prove the cruelty, to succeed in the divorce petition. But difference of opinion otherwise, in view of the particular circumstances at the matrimonial home, whereby the wife could not lead a peaceful life time, shall not, always be 'cruelty', but these are also reasonable grounds to deny joint residence. In such cases, it could not be held that there was willful discretion to deny payment of maintenance.
The Family Court had earlier directed a man - the revision petitioner, to pay Rs 4,000 maintenance to his wife who had claimed the same under Section 125(1) CrPC. In revision before the high court, the husband argued that since she had left his company voluntarily and without any justified reasons, he had no liability to pay maintenance to his wife. 
The counsel appearing for the husband contended that the wife is not legally entitled to get maintenance since she has been willingly residing separately and that the case filed by the respondent on the ground of cruelty ended in acquittal.
The court said the evidence suggests that wife left the matrimonial home since she could not reside there due to the particular circumstances prevailing over there.
"In view of the above, there is no reason to hold that the respondent is not entitled to get maintenance. Therefore, the entitlement of maintenance found by the Family Court can only be confirmed," said the court.
However, considering the fact that the woman remarried in September 2022, the court observed that the entitlement of maintenance ceased from the date of remarriage. 
"However, the revision petitioner is bound to clear the maintenance till this date," it added.
The court reduced the maintenance amount to Rs 3,500 after observing that actual income of the husband was not fully established. 
"Therefore, the revision petitioner is directed to clear the entire arrears at the rate of Rs.3,500/- per month, starting from the date of petition till the date of remarriage, within a period of thirty days and on failure to do so, the respondents are at liberty to execute the modified order, in accordance with law," it ordered.
Advocate M R Sarin appeared for the Revision Petitioner.
Advocate Badra Kumari K V appeared for the Respondent. 
Case Title: Arun v. Reshma 

The Allahabad High Court on Tuesday observed that relationship is not a factor affecting the credibility of a witness as there is no bar in law on examining family members as witnesses. The Court also stressed that evidence of a related witness can be relied upon provided it is trustworthy.
The bench of Justice Suneet Kumar and Justice Vikram D. Chauhan observed thus while upholding the life sentence awarded to an accused who raped and murdered an 80-year-old woman in the year 2006 and was convicted by Additional Sessions Judge, Gautambudh Nagar under Sections 376 and 302 of the Indian Penal Code.
The case in brief
As per the prosecution's case, the informant (Sunil Singh) used to live in a rented house along with her wife and mother/victim. On the intervening night of 1 / 2 July 2006, the victim (mother of the informant) as usual was sleeping in the open space, adjacent to the room of the informant.
It was alleged that the room of the accused Manvir was nearby and when the informant and his family members (who were sleeping on the terrace) came down in the morning, they saw that the accused Manvir was cleaning the bloodstains on the floor. 
After seeing the informant and his wife, the accused Manvir went inside his room and locked his room. When the son of the informant knocked on the door of the room of Manvir, he opened and tried to run away, but was caught, and was handed over to the police.
An FIR was registered and after filing of the charge sheet in the case, a trial took place, and vide judgment dated 5 December 2007 and sentence dated 6 December 2007, the Accused was held guilty. Challenging his conviction and sentence, he moved to the High Court.
Court's observations
At the outset, the Court noted that the act of the accused going into his room (after seeing the informant and his family members) and locking his room, was a relevant fact under Section 8 of the Evidence Act, which indicated the fact that the accused is guilty of the offence.
Now, when an objection was raised by the counsel for the accused that the witnesses P.W.-1 (Informant) and P.W.-2 (wife of the informant) are relatives of the deceased and as such, the testimony of P.W.-1 and P.W.-2 cannot be relied upon, the Court observed that ordinarily, a close relative would be the last to screen the real culprit and falsely implicate an innocent person.
"Merely because the witnesses are family members their evidence cannot per se be discarded. When there is allegation of interestedness, the same has to be established. Mere statement that being relatives of the deceased they are likely to falsely implicate the accused cannot be a ground to discard the evidence which is otherwise cogent and credible. Relationship is not a factor to affect credibility of a witness. It is more often than not that a relation would not conceal actual culprit and make allegations against an innocent person. Foundation has to be laid if plea of false implication is made. There is no bar in law on examining family members as witness. Evidence of a related witness can be relied upon provided it is trustworthy," the Court remarked.
Further, taking into account the facts, evidence, and circumstances of the case, the Court noted that the incident had occurred at a place, not ordinarily accessible by the public at large and therefore, under normal circumstances, an independent witness may not be available and the related witnesses may be a natural witness. 
"In the instant matter, we find the testimony of the witnesses to be consistent and reliable, and therefore reject the contention of the appellant that the testimony of the witnesses must be disbelieved because they are close relatives of the deceased and hence interested witnesses...(The) prosecution has brought on record the circumstantial evidence and medical evidence including the conduct of the accused immediately after the alleged occurrence which points towards the guilt of the accused and as such, the prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt," the Court further observed.
Consequently, on the basis of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the Court said, the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Finding that the allegations against the accused-appellant under Sections 376 and 302 of the Indian Penal Code stood proved by the prosecution, the Court dismissed the appeal.
Case title - Manvir v. State [JAIL APPEAL No. - 4325 of 2009]

The Supreme Court has held that preliminary enquiry by Central Bureau of Investigation in cases of corruption is not mandatory.
"In case the information received by the CBI, through a complaint or a "source information" discloses the commission of a cognizable offence, it can directly register a Regular Case instead of conducting a Preliminary Enquiry, where the officer is satisfied that the information discloses the commission of a cognizable offence", the bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and BV Nagarathna observed.
"An FIR will not stand vitiated because a Preliminary Enquiry has not been conducted", the Court stated in the judgment. 
The court clarified that if the CBI chooses not to hold a preliminary enquiry, the accused cannot demand it as a matter of right.
In this case, an FIR in a disproportionate assets case was quashed by Telangana High Court inter alia observing that the CBI should have conducted a Preliminary Enquiry under the Central Bureau of Investigation (Crime) Manual 2005 before registration of the FIR. 
Before the Apex Court in appeal, the CBI contended that the CBI Manual does not make it mandatory to conduct a Preliminary Enquiry before the registration of the FIR and its provisions are directory. On the other side, it was contended that a Preliminary Enquiry before the registration of an FIR is a necessary requirement in cases of alleged corruption involving public servants, including those of Disproportionate Assets, since undue haste would lead to registration of frivolous and untenable complaints which could affect the careers of these officials.
Therefore, the question considered by the court was whether the CBI is mandatorily required to conduct a Preliminary Enquiry before the registration of an FIR in every case involving claims of alleged corruption against public servants?
Referring to various decisions including that of the Constitution Bench in Lalita Kumari v. Govt. of UP (2014) 2 SCC 1, the court observed that they do not mandate that a Preliminary Enquiry must be conducted before the registration of an FIR in corruption cases. An FIR will not stand vitiated because a Preliminary Enquiry has not been conducted, it said. The court added that the purpose of Lalita Kumari (supra) noting that a Preliminary Enquiry is valuable in corruption cases was not to vest a right in the accused but to ensure that there is no abuse of the process of law in order to target public servants.
 Referring to CBI manual, the court noted the following: (i) a Preliminary Enquiry is registered when information (received from a complaint or "source information") after verification indicates serious misconduct on part of a public servant but is not enough to justify the registration of a Regular Case; and (ii) when the information available or after its secret verification reveals the commission of a cognizable offence, a Regular Case has to be registered instead of a Preliminary Enquiry being resorted to necessarily. Therefore, the court held thus:
"32. In view of the above discussion, we hold that since the institution of a Preliminary Enquiry in cases of corruption is not made mandatory before the registration of an FIR under the CrPC, PC Act or even the CBI Manual, for this Court to issue a direction to that affect will be tantamount to stepping into the legislative domain. Hence, we hold that in case the information received by the CBI, through a complaint or a "source information" under Chapter 8, discloses the commission of a cognizable offence, it can directly register a Regular Case instead of conducting a Preliminary Enquiry, where the officer is satisfied that the information discloses the commission of a cognizable offence"
The court clarified that this does not take away the value of conducting a Preliminary Enquiry in an appropriate case.
"33. This has been acknowledged by the decisions of this Court in P Sirajuddin (supra), Lalita Kumari (supra) and Charansingh (supra). Even in Vinod Dua (supra), this Court noted that "[a]s a matter of fact, the accepted norm - be it in the form of CBI Manual or like instruments is to insist on a preliminary inquiry". The registration of a Regular Case can have disastrous consequences for the career of an officer, if the allegations ultimately turn out to be false. In a Preliminary Enquiry, the CBI is allowed access to documentary records and speak to persons just as they would in an investigation, which entails that information gathered can be used at the investigation stage as well. Hence, conducting a Preliminary Enquiry would not take away from the ultimate goal of prosecuting accused persons in a timely manner. However, we once again clarify that if the CBI chooses not to hold a Preliminary Enquiry, the accused cannot demand it as a matter of right. As clarified by this Court in Managipet (supra), the purpose of Lalita Kumari (supra) noting that a Preliminary Enquiry is valuable in corruption cases was not to vest a right in the accused but to ensure that there is no abuse of the process of law in order to target public servants", the court said.
Examining the case on merits, the bench set aside the  High Court judgment Court and held that CBI can continue with its investigation based upon the FIR.

The Bombay High Court has restrained the Maharashtra Public Services Commission (MPSC) from issuing appointment letters for engineers under the reserved Economically Weaker Section Category (EWS) till the issue of diverting SEBC candidates to EWS is settled.
 The bench comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Abhay Ahuja noted that a petition challenging MPSC's decision to consider candidates from the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) for EWS posts after the SEBC Act was struck down by the Supreme Court is pending final hearing. 
 Therefore, the court stayed the appointment process to 111 EWS posts and directed the MAT to dispose off the matter by January 2023. 
 "Although we normally refrain from interfering with the business of the Tribunal to decide pleas pending before it, having regard to the importance of the present issue, we would encourage the Tribunal to make earnest endeavor to proceed with the hearing of the original application without granting any unnecessary adjournment to any party so that the final decision can be pronounced by it by the end of January 2023," the HC said.
 The original applicants approached the High Court saying that the final arguments were to begin before MAT. However, the MAT had refused to stay the appointments till the case was finally heard.
While refusing relief, MAT noted that the recruitments were pending since 2019 and the final appointments would be subject to the outcome of the proceedings before the tribunal.
 Senior Advocate Mihir Desai for the plaintiff argued that the government decided to issue the appointment letters just days before the final arguments were to begin before the MAT. 
 The High Court observed that MAT's order dated November 29, 2022 failed to note that a coordinate Bench of the High Court, on 29th July 2022 in Vikas Balwant Alase and Ors. vs. Union of India and Ors. set aside a similar decision by the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) allowing SEBC candidates to be appointed on posts reserved for EWS candidates was interdicted. 
 While an appeal is filed by MSEDCL against the order in Supreme Court, no stay is operative, the High Court noted. 
 The Government shall, however, be at liberty to issue appointment letters to the selected candidates for filling up posts other than the posts reserved for the EWS category, it added.

The Kerala High Court recently reiterated the difference between an agreement and a bond by establishing that for an instrument to partake the character of a bond, an obligation must have been created in the instrument itself.

The Kerala High Court recently reiterated the difference between an agreement and a bond by establishing that for an instrument to partake the character of a bond, an obligation must have been created in the instrument itself. 
The question before the Court was whether the agreement entered into by the parties is a bond as defined under Section 2(a) of the Kerala Stamp Act, 1959 or an agreement.
Justice Viju Abraham recalled excerpts from several landmark decisions to come to a decision:
"The distinguishing feature of a bond is that the obligation must have been created in the instrument itself and that if the obligation was a pre-existing one, it does not partake the character of a bond... Where an obligation is a pre-existing one, the subsequent document giving the nature of the obligation or the terms and conditions of the contract shall be a mere agreement." 
Finding that there was a specific acknowledgement in the agreement of an amount that is outstanding to be paid to the petitioner as on the date of execution of the document, it could only be construed as an agreement and it does not partake the character of a bond as defined in Section 2(a) of the Act.
Hence, it was held that the said document can only be construed as an agreement and not as a bond. 
Background:
The petitioner and respondent had engaged in several business transactions over the years, and they decided to put an end to the same on settlement of accounts. It was found that a sum of Rs.53,57,000/- was payable by the respondent. 
Based on that, an agreement and a promissory note were executed on 16th January 2017.
Accordingly, a suit was filed before the trial court for the realisation of a sum of over Rs.54 lakhs from the respondent herein. 
However, the court found that the obligation to pay was created by the said agreement itself; therefore the document has the character of a bond and directed the petitioner to pay stamp duty and penalty.
The petitioner herein moved the Court against the above order of the Additional Sub Court. 
Contentions Raised:
Advocate N.M Madhu appearing for the petitioner argued that a reading of the impugned document would clearly show that no liability was created by it and the same was executed only to acknowledge and admit a liability that already existed. Therefore he contended that a document whereby the executor undertakes to clear a pre-existing liability within the period provided is only an agreement and not a bond.
Accordingly, it was argued that the order directing to pay stamp duty and penalty treating it as a bond is unsustainable and liable to be set aside by the Court.
Advocate V.V Surendran representing the respondent contended that the account had been settled as per the said agreement and the amount liable to be paid to the petitioner as per the settlement of accounts is clearly stated in Clause (3) of the document. 
As such, it was argued that an obligation to pay money has been created by the said document itself; hence, it will come within the definition of a bond as defined in Section 2(a) of the Act. 
Observations:
The Court examined the provisions of Section 2(a) of the Act to decide if the impugned document qualified as a bond. Pursuant to such examination, it was found that for an instrument to partake the character of a bond an obligation must have been created in the instrument itself.
On such understanding, the Bench then analysed the document in question. Clause (2) of the said instrument only stated that both parties settled the accounts involved in the said business transaction carried out during the last three years by mutual consent in full satisfaction on the said date.
Further in Clause (3) of the agreement, the respondent admits that he owes Rs.53,57,000/- to the petitioner and that he acknowledges that Rs.53,57,000/- is outstanding to be paid to the petitioner. 
The Court observed that the wording in Clause (3) made it explicitly clear that it is only an acknowledgement of an amount that is outstanding to be paid to the petitioner as on the date of execution of the document. As per the said agreement, the respondent only undertook to repay the existing liability within a time frame.
As there was a specific acknowledgement in the agreement of an amount that is outstanding to be paid to the petitioner as on the date of execution of the document, it could only be construed as an agreement and it does not partake the character of a bond as defined in Section 2(a) of the Act.
The instrument in question only acknowledges a pre-existing liability of an amount to be paid by the respondent to the petitioner.
In the facts and circumstances of the case, it was held that the said document can only be construed as an agreement and not as a bond. Therefore, the original petition was allowed, and the order of the trial court was set aside.
Case Title: Safir v. Sajid

The Jharkhand High Court has recently held that to justify a 'humanitarian appointment,' one only needs to show the provision of law which allows such an appointment; and no other document of law can justify the same in the absence of the power to do so. 
Justice Anubha Rawat Choudhary placed no merit in the petitioner's argument that he could not place his best defence as he was not given an opportunity to produce essential documents. She remarked, 
"The petitioner, in order to justify his appointment of "humanitarian ground" has to simply show the provision of law and no document can justify his appointment of "humanitarian ground" in absence of any power to do so. In the absence of power to appoint on "humanitarian ground," no document concerning appointment could have justified the appointment of the petitioner, and accordingly, the arguments of the petitioner that he could not place his best defence in the absence of essential documents are devoid of any merits and in fact no prejudice has been caused to the petitioner by non-supply of documents demanded by the petitioner."
A writ petition was filed by the Petitioner challenging the order of his dismissal. The challenge was made alleging that the authorities had already decided to impose major punishment and that the departmental proceedings were a mere formality. The appeal filed by the petitioner against the dismissal was also rejected.
The draft memo of charge was issued to the petitioner based on a report submitted by one IGP alleging the illegal appointment of the petitioner. The Court noted that this communication could not be seen as a dictation of the higher authority.
Further, even the inquiry officer was not influenced by the said communication, which is apparent from the allegation of fraud and forgery was brushed aside by the inquiry officer for want of documents. The inquiry officer recorded finding that the petitioner's appointment was illegal. There is no provision for appointment on "humanitarian ground," based on the face of the appointment letter itself produced by the petitioner before the inquiry officer. 
Therefore, the Court noted that a pre-conceived mind initiated neither the department proceedings nor the letter issued by the higher authority constituting department inquiry influenced the department proceedings, causing any prejudice to the petitioner.
The Court referred to the case of Kuldeep Singh v. The Commissioner of Police & Others, where the issue of bias of the inquiry officer has also been considered, wherein it has been held that the inquiry proceedings will be vitiated if the inquiry officer acts so arbitrarily and as a matter of course merely carrying out the command from some superior officer who perhaps directed "fix him up." The Court held that although the petitioner has made an allegation that the dismissal of the petitioner was already contemplated at the time of issuance of the charge memo itself. The departmental inquiry was only a formality; neither has any allegation been made against the two inquiry officers who conducted the proceedings, nor is there anything on record to suggest bias against the petitioner. It added, 
"Rather, the inquiry officer refused to record any adverse finding against the petitioner on the major part of the allegation against him regarding obtaining appointment by using forged documents in the absence of the material documents being not available on record. Thus, the petitioner's allegation regarding the inquiry having been held with a pre-conceived mind, is also rejected."
The Court also noted that the provision of Article 311(2) (b) of the Constitution does not apply to the instant case. It applies when a situation renders holding of inquiry not reasonably practical, and the disciplinary authority must record in writing its reasons to support its satisfaction. In the present case, the inquiry was initiated, the petitioner participated, the inquiry report was submitted, and the order of punishment was passed.

In a significant observation, the Tripura High Court has observed that the mother of a sexual assault victim girl would never put her daughter's entire name, fame, and even entire life at stake by giving her a label of a victim of sexual assault.
Observing thus, the Bench of Justice T. Amarnath Goud and Justice Arindam Lodh affirmed the rape conviction of a man under Sections 376(2)(f) of the IPC for sexually assaulting a 4-year-old girl in the year 2012.
The background of the Case
Essentially, the Accused had moved the High Court challenging his conviction under Sections 376(2)(f) of the IPC and a sentence to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years passed by Addl. Sessions Judge, West Tripura, Agartala.
The Lower had taken into account the evidence of the victim and her mother (PW4) to come to the conclusion that the prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt that she was taken by the Accused in his house by telling that he would give her chips and chocolate etc and then the accused undressed her and rape her.
Moving to the High Court, the Accused contended that the prosecution story was unnatural, improbable, and fabricated one.
Court's observations
At the outset, the Court observed that the lower court had taken all measures to find out the mental ability of the minor girl while she deposed before the Court and only after a preliminary test and being convinced about her mental ability to depose, the court had proceeded with recording her evidence. 
The Court further noted that the complaint made by the mother (PW4) of the victim on the date of incidence before the police station and her evidence deposed before the court remained unshaken. Likewise, the child victim too, narrated her version and the act committed by the accused and even her evidence remained unshaken. 
Against this backdrop, the Court concluded that there is no reason to disbelieve the complaint filed by the mother and the evidence of the victim girl.
Importantly, the Court stressed that while considering the evidence advanced by the mother (PW4) of the victim, the trial court had rightly observed that a mother is a protector disciplinarian and friend of a child. 
Further, opining that a mother is also a selfless loving human who sacrifices many of her wants and needs for the wants and needs of her child, the Court remarked thus:
"A mother works hard to make sure that her child is safe equipped with the knowledge skills and abilities to make it a competent human being. It is for that reason, it is unbelievable to say that a mother would put her daughters entire life at stake by involving her in a serious matter like the case at hand. PW4 being mother of the victim girl would never put her daughter's entire name, fame and even entire life at stake by giving her daughter a label of a victim of sexual assault."
With this, the Court refused to interfere with the judgment passed by the trial court and affirmed the same.

The Supreme Court has observed that the pension payable to an employee on retirement shall be determined on the rules existing at the time of retirement. The Court also observed that the law did not allow the employer to apply the rules differently in relation to persons who are similarly situated.
The bench of Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna in the present matter was considering a civil appeal against an order dated August 29, 2019 passed by the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court wherein the High Court had dismissed an appeal.
While allowing the appeal the bench in Dr. G. Sadasivan Nair V. Cochin University Of Science And Technology Represented By Its Registrar, & Ors observed that,
"While we accept the settled position of law that the rule applicable in matters of determination of pension is that which exists at the time of retirement, we are unable to find any legal basis in the action of the respondent University of selectively allowing the benefit of Rule 25 (a). The law, as recognized by this Court in Deoki Nandan Prasad and Syed Yousuddin Ahmed (supra) unequivocally states that the pension payable to an employee on retirement shall be determined on the rules existing at the time of retirement. However, the law does not allow the employer to apply the rules differently in relation to persons who are similarly situated."
Factual Background 
The appellant, Dr G Sadasivan Nair was appointed as a lecturer in the School of Legal Studies of Cochin University Of Science And Technology ("University") with effect from 7th September 1984. Prior to such appointment, the appellant was a lawyer practising in the District Court and Subordinate Courts Kerala for the period between 11th March 1972 and 2nd February 1980. During the period between March 1980 and February 1984, he pursued his PhD programme on availing a University Grants Commission Fellowship and resumed practice as an advocate in the Kerala High Court and Subordinate Courts after obtaining his PhD, upto the date of his appointment as a lecturer in the University.
On 10th November 2004, he made a representation before the Registrar of the University, requesting to reckon his practice of eight years at the Bar for the purpose of determining his pensionary benefits payable to him on his superannuation by relying on Rule 25 (a), Part III, Kerala Service Rules ("KSR").
The appellant received a letter on 7th January 2006, from the Registrar of the University declining his request to reckon his tenure of practice at the Bar for the purpose of determining appellant's superannuation pension. While rejecting the Registrar relied on the proviso to Rule 25 (a), Part III.
Aggrieved, the appellant approached the Chancellor of the University contending that the Registrar had rejected his request for reckoning his tenure of practice at the Bar for the purpose of determining his superannuation pension, without following the relevant rules in their proper perspective. 
Since the appellant received no response to his representation, he preferred a writ before the Kerala High Court on the same ground. The High Court on April 3, 2006 directed the Chancellor to decide within a period of four months from the date of receipt of the judgment of the High Court, the question, as to, whether the appellant was entitled to get the benefit under Rule 25(a), Part III, KSR.
In accordance with the High Court's judgment dated 3rd April 2006, the Chancellor afforded an opportunity of hearing to the appellant on 12th July 2006 and subsequently dismissed the appeal petition preferred by the appellant on 7th October, 2006 by holding that the Government or any other statutory body had the right to modify the service conditions, even retrospectively. 
Aggrieved by the dismissal, the appellant preferred a writ petition before the High Court. The Single judge of the High Court on January 25, 2012 dismissed the writ on the ground that it was open to the Government to unilaterally alter the service conditions of employees during their service. The bench further said that what was applicable was the rule prevailing as on the date of retirement and not that which existed as on the date of entering service.
Aggrieved, by the order of Single Judge the appellant preferred an intra court appeal which was dismissed by the Division Bench.
Contentions Of Counsels 
Senior Counsel Dr KP Pillay submitted that Rule 25 (a), Part III, KSR as it stood at the time of appointment of the appellant to the post of lecturer in the School of Legal Studies of the University allowed experience at the Bar to be reckoned as qualifying service for the purpose of determining superannuation pension. It was also his contention that the proviso to Rule 25 (a), Part III, KSR, which limited the scope of the benefit conferred under Rule 25(a) by stating that such benefit would only be available to such employees as are recruited to those posts requiring a qualification in law and experience at the Bar, was introduced with effect from 12th February 1985. In this regard he submitted that said proviso could not have been made applicable to the appellant as it was not in force at the time of his appointment, i.e., on 7th September 1984. 
Opposing the submissions, Advocate Malini Poduval contended that the benefit under the said Rule was rightly withheld by the University in light of the proviso. In relation to the appellant's contention that other employees of the University who were similarly situated as the appellant, had been granted the benefit under Rule 25(a), it was submitted that the appellant could not claim such relief relying on an earlier illegal order. She further submitted that such a claim based on negative equality in favour of the appellant was untenable.
Advocate G Prakash appeared for the State.
Supreme Court's Analysis 
The bench in the judgement authored by Justice BV Nagarathna observed that the appellant as well as Dr P Leela Krishnan were similarly situated and both were appointed as teaching faculty after practicing as advocates in various courts of Kerala.
In this regards, the Court said that, "We find no valid ground to sustain the application of the proviso in relation to the appellant, thereby denying the benefit of Rule 25(a), when the same was not applied in the case of Dr. P. Leela Krishnan, thereby allowing the benefit of Rule 25(a)."
"We are of the view that if the respondent University sought to deny the benefit of Rule 25 (a), in light of the proviso which was subsequently inserted thereby limiting the benefit of the Rule, it ought to have done so uniformly. However, the action of the respondent University of selectively applying the proviso to Rule 25(a) in relation to the appellant, while not applying the said proviso in relation to similarly situated persons, is arbitrary and therefore illegal. Such discrimination, which is not based on any reasonable classification, is violative of all canons of equality which are enshrined in the Constitution of India," Court further said.

The High Court of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh on Thursday ruled that an employer cannot impose such conditions of employment which have the effect of taking away the right of its employees to seek judicial review of the actions of the employer. 
The court held that the right to seek judicial review is a vital right conferred by the Constitution and any terms and conditions of employment, which restrain a person to seek legal remedies for enforcement of his rights, are null and void.
 The court passed the observations in two petitions filed by the casual labourers challenging the order of Area Manager, Food Corporation of India (FCI) issued in November, 24, 2016 wherein the petitioners along with proforma respondents had been accorded temporary status, subject to certain terms and conditions laid down in the order. The petitioners were given the temporary status which entitled them to have the minimum pay scale of regular class IV employees working in FCI including DA, HRA, Lunch, subsidy and conveyance allowance on par with regular class IV employees of FCI.
 The petitioners had challenged the said order of FCI whereby the casual workers including the petitioners, who were conferred temporary status shall not be brought on permanent payroll and shall not become employees of the FCI unless policy of regularization or permanent absorption is issued by the FCI in future on the ground that it took away their right of seeking a judicial review.
 In their plea before the court, the petitioners also claimed that they were entitled to be brought on permanent establishment in the same manner in which similarly situated petitioners in another petition had been regularized and brought on the permanent establishment of Food Corporation of India.
 Perusing the material on record the bench noted that the condition No.(iii) in the impugned order, debarring the petitioners and other beneficiaries of order from taking recourse to litigation for seeking their regularization and arrears etc., is not sustainable in law. The bench recorded that one of the conditions i.e condition No. (iii) of the order, is bad in the eyes of law and the same shall be deemed to have been deleted from the said order, the bench underscored.
 "Otherwise also, the aforesaid condition has outlived its utility and has not been pressed into service by the respondent-FCI to deny the petitioners any right, nor shall the petitioners be liable for any action for filing the instant petitions or in future to enforce their rights in breach of offending clause i.e condition No.(iii) of the impugned order," the court said.
 While declining any intervention, the court noted that the petitioners approached the court after the gap of five years and that the petitioners along with proforma respondents got the benefits envisaged under the impugned order and worked in that capacity for almost five years without any objection or demur.
 "The petitioners have not been able to bring to my notice any representation or protest petition filed by them against the impugned order," the court said.
 It was only in the year 2021, the petitioners and proforma respondents woke up from the slumber and issued a legal notice through their counsel to the FCI on July 26, 2021. "This notice was obviously issued as a run up to the filing of instant petition and to come out of the delay and laches," the bench recorded.
 However court in its judgement also observed that it "hopes and trusts" that the Public Sector Undertakings (PSU) will, sooner than later, come up with appropriate policy of regularization "to erase the scars that are left after healing of wounds (grant of temporary status) of the petitioners".
 Parting ways Justice Sanjeev Kumar further observed that this court is sure that the respondent- Corporation (PSU), being a model employer, is alive to its duty towards its employees particularly those working at the lowest rung and "would not indulge in any labour practice which is unfair and is tantamount to exploitation."

Underscoring that customary divorce is a social evil, the Gujarat High Court recently refused to grant a declaration regarding the dissolution of marriage on the basis of a customary divorce of a couple noting that the same was not adequately proved by the wife (who was in an appeal seeking such declaration).
The bench, however, clarified that the parties were at liberty to file an appropriate application under the relevant provision of the Hindu Marriage Act and pray for a decree of divorce with consent, and directed the court to take such application for hearing at the earliest.
The Bench of Justice JB Pardiwala and VD Nanavati, in its order, observed that Customary divorces are decided by few persons, who may not have much idea about the social developments and the constitutional perspective. 
"Such customary divorces are affecting personal liberty and fundamental rights of the women to adjudicate their issues before the competent forum...Even after the development of the constitutional principles and in the presence of ever so many welfare legislations in favour of women, the Courts are recognizing the customary divorces, which can never be accepted nor be approved. Customary divorce undoubtedly is a social evil. Customary divorces undoubtedly are happening on account of the attitude of ill-minded male chauvinists," the Court added.
Referring to philosopher Bertrand Russell, the Court said that the National policy is the best policy and that Regionalism is a bad policy and therefore, the Court also stressed that injecting nationalism in the minds of the people for the development of our great Nation is of paramount importance. 
"Internationalism is not possible. Regionalism will paralise the unity and stop the developmental activities. Thus, the Courts and Statesmen should not recognize or encourage regionalism. But, they have to promote nationalism," the Court observed.
The case in brief 
The marriage between the appellant (original plaintiff/wife) and the opponent (original defendant/husband) was solemnized in the year 2010 at a village in District Amreli (Gujarat). The parties hail from the Leuva Patel Community.
Over a period of time, matrimonial disputes arose between the appellant (wife) and the opponent (husband) and when it appeared that reconciliation between the parties can't happen, the family members and the relatives of the parties decided to dissolve the marriage by way of a customary deed of divorce. 
Consequently, the Panch of the community thought fit to put an end to the marriage by way of customary divorce and the parties amicably relegated themselves to customary divorce. 
Now, since the wife wished to settle abroad and the foreign embassy/immigration authority may not look into the customary deed of divorce as to understand the marital status of the parties in law, the wife instituted the Family Suit seeking a declaration that the marriage between the parties stood validly dissolved by way of the customary deed of divorce.
The Family Court dismissed the Suit substantially on the ground that the plaintiff failed to prove any practice of customary divorce being prevalent in the Leuva Patel Community and being dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order, the appellant – original plaintiff (wife) moved the Court with the instant appeal. The Husband did not appear in the appeal.
Court's observations
At the outset, the Court referred to various supreme court rulings to conclude that the prevalence of customary divorce in the community to which the parties belong, contrary to the general law of divorce must be specifically pleaded and established by person propounding such custom in order that divorce be granted.
In this regard, the Court observed that a conjoint reading of Section 3(a), 4(a) and 29 (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 would indicate that though Section 29(2) of the Act saves the customary rights, a person who relies upon such custom has to prove that such custom and usage had been continuously and uniformly observed for a long time and had obtained the force of law amongst the Hindus in their local area, tribe, community, group or family and such custom was not unreasonable or opposed to public policy.
The Court noted that the wife had stated in her examination-in-chief that customary divorce in the Leuva Patel Community was permissible and in support of such statement, she had relied upon five affidavits of five individuals belonging to the Leuva Patel Community.
However, in response to this, the Court observed thus:
"It is difficult to appreciate how did the appellant -plaintiff (wife) expect the Family Court to take into consideration the affidavits of five members of the Leuva Patel community. The question is whether such affidavits would constitute legal evidence?... In our view, the appellant – plaintiff (wife) could be said to have miserably failed to prove the prevalence of customary divorce in the Leuva Patel Community to obtain divorce by execution of the document in presence of the Panchas when such customary divorce was contrary to the general law of divorce prescribed under the provisions of the Act, 1955."
Against this backdrop, dismissing the appeal filed by the wife, the Court expressed its concern that customary divorces are being approved by the Civil Courts even without ascertaining the basic factors regarding the customs prevailing as well as practice. Customary divorce can never be approved nor recognized by the law
Further, the Court also observed thus:
"The Hindu Marriage Act, which was enacted in the year 1955, recognized such customary divorce and now, after a lapse of 64 years, the practice of granting customary divorce can never be adopted nor be followed and the Courts should not approve any such customary divorce granted by few men from the community or the relatives of the husband or wife. In the event of approving such customary divorces, then the implications would be large and we will be marching towards backward and that can never be accepted"
Underscoring the importance of the concept of family, the Court observed that the concept needs to be protected for the development of our Nation and further noted that in Indian society, divorce is a social evil. The Court also stressed that characteristically molded individuals alone can constitute a good family and that a good family constitutes good Nation. 
"A good Nation alone can prosper in developmental activities. Thus, good families are the foundation for the development of our great Nation...The man being a social animal cannot live separately. Under these circumstances, on the one hand we are talking about women empowerment, opportunity for women in all fields and at all levels, however, we are neglecting certain other factors, like, grant of divorce, non-maintenance etc.," the Court further added.

Read Order/Judgment

The Bombay High Court recently regarded a challenge to the constitutional validity of Section 29A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 – whether the exercise of powers by the District Consumer Forum without the President being its party is illegal?

The Bombay High Court recently regarded a challenge to the constitutional validity of Section 29A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 – whether the exercise of powers by the District Consumer Forum without the President being its party is illegal? A bench of Justices V. M. Deshpande and Amit B. Borkar answered the question in the negative.
 The facts leading to this challenge involve an order dated 17.02.2020 of the District Consumer Forum that was signed by only two Members without the President being party to it. The petitioners-developers were aggrieved by this order; however, instead of availing statutory remedy under the provisions of the said Act, they filed a writ petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. The petitioners have challenged Section 29A of the Act on the touchstone of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India on the ground that the absence of the President, who is a Judicial Member, violates Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
 The Respondent submitted that Hon'ble Apex Court, while delivering the judgment in State of Karnataka Vs. Vishwabhuthi House Building Co-operative Society [(2003) 2 SCC 412] has already upheld the virus of the said Act. It stated that the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, has been enforced from 20.07.2020 by repelling the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 with the result present challenge to Section 29A of the said Act becomes infructuous. 
Respondent further referred to Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Gulzari Lal Agrawal Vs. Accounts Officer [(1996) 10 SCC 590] has held that Sub-section (2) of Section 14 of the Act is a presumptuous provision where the President of the State Commission is functional. Still, it would not be correct to say that if the President of the State Commission is non-functional because of one or the other reason, the State Commission would stop its functioning and wait till the President is appointed. It is held that Rules are framed with a view to making the State Commission functional in the absence of the President and not to halt the State Commission or to render it non-functional for want of the President. Therefore, the provisions of the said Act need to be construed harmoniously to promote the object and spirit of the Act.
 Petitioners submitted that Section 29A of the said Act permits District Forum to function without President, which is unconstitutional as he is a Judicial Member. He submitted that Section 29A of the said Act is inconsistent with Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India as two unequal are treated as equal. It is submitted that Section 29A of the Act is in conflict with other provisions of the Act. He submitted that the composition of the Forum at the various levels under the Act takes away the guarantee of a fair trial before the Forum as, in the absence of the President, the majority of the members are legally untrained.
 The bench noted that the Apex Court in the case of Joint Secretary, Political Department, State of Meghalaya Vs. High Court of Meghalaya [(2016) 11 SCC 245 laid down the requirements of pleadings insofar as the petition challenging the constitutional validity of Article 14 is concerned. The essential requirements of pleadings in the petition challenging discrimination or unreasonable discriminatory standard is concerned, the material needs to be placed before the Court by way of scientific analysis, and it cannot be done by priory reasoning. It is mandatory for the petitioners to prima facie show acceptable grounds in support of such a challenge. The party has to plead prima facie acceptable grounds showing how the impugned provision of a statute is discriminatory offending Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The consequence of the absence of pleading as law laid down is that a challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute or statutory provision is liable to be rejected in limine.
 The bench said,
 "The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that Constitutional Courts can strike down legislative enactments only on two grounds, namely:- i) The legislator does not competent to make the law; ii) that such statute or provision takes away or breaches any of the fundamental rights enumerated in Part-III of the Constitution of India."
 The bench noted that the scope of a petition challenging constitutional validity has been laid down in the decision in Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice Tendolkar (A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 538), in which the law was elaborately discussed, and certain principles were laid down. The following are relevant in this case:— 
"(b) that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles; (c) that it must be presumed that the Legislature understands and correctly appreciates the need of its own people, that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based on adequate grounds; (d) that the Legislature is free to recognise degrees of harm and may confine its restrictions to those cases where the need is deemed to be the clearest; (e) that in order to sustain the presumption of constitutionality the Court may take into consideration matters of common knowledge, matters of common report, the history of the times and may assume every state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of legislation". 
In light of the settled presumption of constitutionality in favour of Legislation unless the contrary is shown, the bench concluded that there is no merit in the challenge to the constitutional validity of Section 29A of the Consumer Protection Act,1986.

The Supreme Court has dismissed a plea challenging denial of sanction to prosecute Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in a case alleging making of hate speech in 2007.
The bench comprising Chief Justice of India, NV Ramana, Justice Hima Kohli and Justice CT Ravikumar observed that the subsequent events have rendered the appeal into a purely academic exercise.
"We think it appropriate that the legal questions on the issue of sanction be left open to be considered in an appropriate case", the bench observed.
The appellant Parvez Parwaz had alleged that Yogi Adityanath had made anti-Muslim hate remarks while addressing "Hindu Yuva Vahini" activists in a meeting held in Gorakhpur on January 27, 2007. He challenged the decision taken by the UP Government on May 3, 2017 refusing sanction to prosecute Adityanath and also the closure report filed in the case. He had earlier approached the Allahabad High Court, which dismissed the petition on February 22, 2018, following which he filed the Special Leave Petition before the Supreme Court.
Advocate Fuzail Ahmad Ayyubi, for the appellant, contended that the accused, who was a Member of Parliament and had allegedly made a hate speech, later on became the Chief Minister of the State of Uttar Pradesh and thereby, the Executive Head of the State. In such a situation, it is the Governor of the State who is empowered to consider the question of grant of sanction in terms of the Rules of Business, it was contended. Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the State, contended that nothing survives in this matter except for a mere academic exercise, as a closure report has already been filed by the investigating agency.
Referring to Section 196 CrPC, the bench observed:
The words "No Court shall take cognizance" employed in Section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short 'CrPC') and the consequential bar created under the said provision would undoubtedly show that the bar is against 'taking of  cognizance by the Court'. In other words, it creates no bar against registration of a crime or investigation by the police agency or submission of a report by the police on completion of investigation as contemplated under Section 173, CrPC
The court noted that, in this case, the investigation has culminated in a closure / refer report and that protest petition has been filed which is pending consideration before the trial Court. These subsequent events have rendered the present appeal into a purely academic exercise, the court noted.
"We do not think it necessary to go into the contentions raised by both sides on the issue of denial of sanction for prosecution and the legal pleas sought to be raised in relation to the said issue. However, we think it appropriate that the legal questions on the issue of sanction be left open to be considered in an appropriate case", the court said while dismissing the appeal.

"I submit that the Bar Council should stand in solidarity with the rights of the members of the legal profession, and not take cognizance of the judgment of Supreme Court which have severely constricted and abridged the freedom, rights and dignity of the members of the Bar and also ordinary citizens," said Advocate Prashant Bhushan in reply to the letter sent by Bar Council of Delhi...
"I submit that the Bar Council should stand in solidarity with the rights of the members of the legal profession, and not take cognizance of the judgment of Supreme Court which have severely constricted and abridged the freedom, rights and dignity of the members of the Bar and also ordinary citizens," said Advocate Prashant Bhushan in reply to the letter sent by Bar Council of Delhi seeking his response as to why proceedings should not be initiated against him in view of the conviction in suo motu contempt case against him.
 He submitted that his two tweets that led to the conviction judgment last month, are "within the limits of freedom of expression" of a member of the Bar and "there is nothing in them which could be termed as contemptuous".
 "The Supreme Court judgments holding me guilty of criminal contempt and further sentencing me for the same, are a fundamental assault on the freedom of speech and independence of the Bar," he said.
 Taking cognisance of the two controversial tweets by Mr. Bhushan and the Supreme Court's consequential verdict holding him guilty of criminal contempt, the Bar Council of Delhi had required the counsel to appear before itself to show cause as to why action under section 24A and section 35 of the Advocates' Act not be proceeded with against him.
 BCD Issues Notice To Prashant Bhushan To Examine Whether Disciplinary Action Be Proceeded With Against Him Over His Two Tweets
 Responding to the letter, Mr. Bhushan said,
 "My conviction for committing criminal contempt was not a conviction for "an offence involving moral turpitude", as is the requirement under Section 24A of the Advocates Act."
 With reference to 'professional misconduct' under Section 35 of the Advocates Act, he said,
 "The test for professional misconduct as reiterated in P.D. Khandekar is whether the actions of the concerned advocate bring disrepute or dishonor to the legal profession and are perceived as such by his brothers and sisters at the Bar. In the present case, far from the Bar disapproving my tweets, I have received a groundswell of support and solidarity for my two tweets from fellow lawyers as well as from retired Judges of Supreme Court and High Courts."
 Mr. Bhushan has pointed out that the Bar Council is not at all bound by the judgment of the Court holding him guilty, and it is for the Council itself to apply its own independent mind and come to a conclusion whether indeed he has committed an act which is worthy of suspension of right to practice law.
 "Thus, merely because my tweets have been held to be contemptuous by the Supreme Court in Suo Motu Contempt Petition No. 1/2020, it would not necessarily follow that the same also constitute "professional or other misconduct". The law on this point was settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the landmark judgment of Supreme Court Bar Assn. v. Union of India ((1998) 4 SCC 409)," Bhushan said.
 He added,
 "the judgments against me are tainted with breach of principles of natural justice and rule against bias. It is for this reason also that the said judgments ought to be disregarded by the BCD."
 Mr. Bhushan has further claimed that the Bar Council of India Rules itself discourage an Advocate to be servile to the Court and it rather casts a "duty" upon him to raise his voice against "improper conduct by any judicial officer".
 In my tweet, Mr, Bhsuhan said, I had tried to raise my voice against the closure of the courts from any sort of normal functioning, which has had a devastating impact on the people's right to access to justice and has also affected the legal community hugely.
 He added,
 "This judgment would have the effect of criminalizing any criticism of the functioning of the judiciary and would have a chilling effect on the right of lawyers and citizens to voice their opinion."
 In this regard, he has also drawn the Council's attention to the submissions made by Senior Advocate Dr. Rajeev Dhavan before the Supreme Court during Mr. Bhushan's hearing on sentencing.
 "Comments Were Opinion Made In Good Faith Founded on True Facts":Rajeev Dhavan Seeks To Recall The SC Judgment Convicting Prashant Bhushan

 He has urged the BCD to take a firm stand in support of the freedom of speech and expression of the Bar as the very freedom, dignity, rights and independence of the Bar are at stake.
 Nevertheless, he has requested that in case the Council decides not to drop the proceedings against him, then the same be put on hold till his review petition against the contempt verdict and the writ petition seeking directions for an intra-court appeal in cases of original criminal conviction by the Supreme Court, are decided.

The Bombay High Court has urged the Union of India to consider Maharashtra's bill to make domestic violence cases (498A IPC) compoundable with the permission of the concerned court citing hardships caused to innumerable couples who are constrained to approach the High Court for quashing.
 A division bench of Justices Revati Mohite Dere and SM Modak asked the Additional Solicitor General (ASG) to take up the issue with the concerned Ministry at the earliest. 
 "…Everyday, we have a minimum of 10 petitions/applications seeking quashing of Section 498A by consent, since 498A is non-compoundable. Concerned parties, have to come personally before the Court from wherever they are residing, including from villages, thus incurring tremendous hardships for the parties concerned, apart from travelling expenses, litigation expenses and staying expenses in the city. Parties, if working, are required to take a day off, " the bench noted adding this would also save the court's time. 
 Conversely, offences listed as compoundable can be quashed before the nearest local court before whom the matter is pending. "The importance of making the Section 498A compoundable with the permission of the Court, can hardly be overlooked/understated," the bench added. 
 Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed the bench that a bill to amend the section 320 (2) of the CrPC, making section 498- A of the IPC compoundable, was passed in both houses of the Maharashtra Government in 2018 and sent to the Union for the President's assent. 
 However, the file continues to remain pending with the Union following an objection from the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development. 
 "Considering what is stated above, we direct the Registry to forward a copy of this order to the learned Additional Solicitor General, for taking necessary steps/action and to enable him to take up the issue before the concerned Ministry, at the earliest," the bench observed. 
 The need to make domestic violence a compoundable offence in Maharashtra was felt way back in 1992, in Suresh Nathmal Rathi and Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & others, wherein the High Court elaborately dealt with the institution of marriage and held that such an amendment would be in the interest of married couples as well as society. 
 Apart from that, numerous Law Commission reports namely, 243rd Report, 154th Report, and 237th Report also make clear recommendations for making section 498-A of the IPC a compoundable offence. The bench noted that the section has been made compoundable in Andhra Pradesh in 2003. 
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau (`NCRB') 2020 report, a total of 1,11,549 cases were registered under 498A in 2020. Fourteen percent cases were closed by police, 96,497 men, 23,809 women were arrested, merely 18,967 cases were tried in courts of which 14,340 led to acquittal and 3,425 led to conviction. Pendency of 498-A cases in that year was 6,51,404 - 96.2%, the bench noted in its order. 
 Case Title: Sandip Sarjerao Sule and Ors. versus The State of Maharashtra and Anr.

Chief Justice of India Dr. Justice Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud on Friday virtually inaugurated ‘Virtual High Courts’ in 10 districts of Odisha. The event was attended by Chief Justice of Orissa High Court Dr. Justice S. Muralidhar and other Judges of the High Court. 
With this inauguration, Odisha became the first State in the country to have Virtual High Courts in districts.
 The Supreme Court in December, 2022, had taken note of technological advancements in Odisha, while hearing a case relating strike of protesting lawyers in district Sambalpur, who were demanding establishment of a permanent Bench of the High Court in Western Odisha. The Court had then noted,
 “We are informed that from any District Court in Odisha, one can file a case in the High Court and also appear virtually. This has been possible with the technological progress. It is proposed that one dedicated room in every district Court premises in Odisha for the purposes of virtually appearing before the High Court every day will be functional soon and there can be adjacent back office to such room which will facilitate e-filing of cases in the High Court. The time period for operationalization of the same is stated to be in three months. We accept the same."
 In the first phase, the High Court has come up with 10 Virtual High Courts in 10 different districts, i.e. Balasore, Berhampur at Ganjam, Bhadrak, Bhawanipatna at Kalahandi, Bhubaneswar at Khurda, Bolangir, Jeypore at Koraput, Puri, Rourkela at Sundargarh and Sambalpur. The remaining 20 districts of the State are likely to get the benefit by the month of March this year.
Out of the current pending caseload of around 1.7 lakh cases in the High Court, around 72,760 cases were filed from the ten districts, with the highest from Khurda district from where around 27,160 cases have been filed.
The districts were also chosen in a manner that will make it easy for those in the neighbouring districts within a radius of 100 KMs to use the facilities of the Virtual High Court. For example, the Virtual High Court facility in Sambalpur can be accessed by those in the neighbouring districts of Bargarh, Deogarh, Jharsuguda and Angul. 
Facilities In Virtual High Courts 
These Virtual High Court Centres will have video conferencing facilities, and importantly, a ‘Back Office’ where it will be possible for lawyers to e-file their cases with assistance from staff or officer dedicated for that purpose. Advocates or parties in person not familiar with computers can hand over the hard copy of the petition to the staff at the Back Office who will then scan and prepare and e-file the petition. 
The following services will be available through digital mode in these Virtual High Courts: 
Scrutiny of e-filed cases and removal of defects.Numbering of the cases. Listing of cases including mentioning before the High Court in virtual mode.Submission of application for and issuance of certified copies of the orders and judgments.
The High Court has supplied the following ICT devices to the districts for functioning of the Virtual High Courts:
55 inches Television (for appearing before the Benches of the High Court);Speakers (for clear audibility);Document Visualizer (for display of the documents during hearing of the cases);Stand cameras and microphones (so that the Advocates can be clearly visible and audible to the Benches);Computers, printers and scanners.
Deployment Of Staff & Training Sessions
The High Court has deputed a trained Assistant Section Officer (ASO) and a Group D employee to each of the 10 districts to run the Back Office in the initial phase. The local staff in each of the districts will be trained to take over after a few months. The High Court has also planned to conduct hands-on training sessions for lawyers, law clerks and staff in the districts to make them conversant with use of the facilities available in Virtual High Courts.
SOP
The High Court has also notified the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the lawyers to utilise the facilities. Further, it has also issued detailed guidelines for functioning of Virtual High Courts in districts along with several administrative guidelines to the District Judges with respect to functioning of such Courts.

Observing that a long period of incarceration of an accused without any hope of conclusion of trial leads to a meltdown of the the rigour of 1st Proviso to Section 437 CrPC, the Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently granted bail to a man accused of murdering his wife.
Justice Sanjay Dhar said the accused has "carved out a case for grant of bail" on account of his long incarceration for more than 12 years and on account of the fact that by the conduct of the prosecution and the police department, there is hardly any chance of conclusion of trial in near future.
The court relied on Hussainara Khatoon vs. Home Secretary, State of Bihar wherein Supreme Court has deprecated the delay in commencement of trials, which it said would apply equally to long pendency of trials. 
It also referred to Union of India vs. K. A. Najeeb, the case where Supreme Court originally observed that "whereas at commencement of proceedings, the courts are expected to appreciate the legislative policy against grant of bail but the rigours of such provisions will melt down where there is no likelihood of trial being completed within a reasonable time and the period of incarceration already undergone has exceeded a substantial part of the prescribed sentence."
"From the foregoing enunciation of the law laid down by the Supreme Court, it becomes clear that long incarceration of an under trial without any likelihood of conclusion of trial in near future infringes upon the right of speedy trial of such undertrial. While the Supreme Court has, in some cases, gone to the extent of quashing the trial itself but consistent view of the Supreme Court has been that in case the delay in conclusion of the trial amounts to oppression or harassment, the Court can interfere in such situations and grant bail to an accused in a heinous crime like murder also," said the court.
The accused Manzoor Ahmad Mir, who was a police constable, allegedly killed his wife in 2010. He is facing trial for offences under Section 302, 380 and 457 RPC. His main ground for bail was his long incarceration and violation of his right to speedy trial. Since there is no likelihood of completion of trial in near future, he deserves to be enlarged on bail, his counsel contended before the court.
The moot question that fell for adjudication before the bench was whether a person who has been accused of having committed a heinous offence like murder, is entitled to be enlarged on bail on the ground of his long incarceration of more than 12 years.
The bench noted that the petitioner had been arrested on 15.12.2010 and the challan against him was filed before the trial court on 12.01.2011. A total of 44 witnesses have been cited in the challan and till date evidence of the prosecution has not been completed, the court observed.
While relying on various Supreme Court judgements, Justice Dhar said in deciding bail applications, one of the important factors which should be taken into account is the delay in concluding the trial. 
"If an accused is denied bail but is ultimately acquitted, nobody is going to compensate him for the period he has spent in custody. Therefore, long incarceration of an accused may not be by itself a ground for grant of bail but it certainly becomes a ground for grant of bail to an accused, if the delay in conclusion of trial is attributable to the prosecution," it added.
Taking note of delay in the case against Mir, the court observed that though warrants of arrest have been issued for presence of some witnesses in the case but the same are not being executed. 
"The record further shows that on 03.10.2022, the learned trial court has even issued a show cause notice to SHO, P/S, Batamaloo, for his failure to execute the warrants against the witnesses but no fruitful purpose has been achieved in spite of taking such steps," it added.
Observing that the delay in conclusion of the trial is solely attributable to the prosecution, the bench said police officials are avoiding to appear before the court as witnesses thereby protracting the trial.
"It is not a case where some civil witnesses, who may have been won over by the accused and avoiding to depose in support of the prosecution but it is a case where even the police officials have scant regard for the process of the Court and they are avoiding to help the prosecution in speedy trial of the case," added the court.
The court further said that without the cooperation and assistance of the prosecuting agency and the police department, the speedy trial will always remain a distant dream.
"The present case is a classic example of prolongation of the trial by the prosecuting agency and the police department whose officials are duty bound to render assistance in speedy trial of cases. It is high time that the respondents should put their house in order and instruct their officers and officials to render all possible assistance in conclusion of criminal trials instead of blaming the Criminal Courts for the delay".
The court further observed that while there cannot be any quarrel with the proposition that long incarceration cannot be sole ground for bail, the accused can certainly be enlarged on bail even in a murder case where trial has been prolonged to infinite limits on account of non-cooperation of the prosecution and the police department.
"As already discussed hereinbefore in the case of long incarceration of an accused without any hope of conclusion of trial in near future, the rigour of 1st Proviso to Section 437 of the Cr. P. C would melt down. If the argument of learned Government Advocate is accepted, then the respondent and its officials can very well avoid appearance in the Court for another ten years thereby ensuring that the petitioner does not come out of jail for next one decade," said the bench.

The Supreme Court has observed that the claim of juvenility can be raised before any Court, at any stage, even after final disposal of the case.
The bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and JK Mahseshwari observed that if the Court finds a person to be a juvenile on the date of commission of the offence, it is to forward the juvenile to the Board for passing appropriate orders, and the sentence, if any, passed by a Court, shall be deemed to have no effect.
"Even though the offence in this case may have been committed before the enactment of the Act of 2000, the petitioner is entitled to the benefit of juvenility under Section 7A of the Act of 2000, if on inquiry it is found that he was less than 18 years of age on the date of the alleged offence," Court further added.
Factual Background
The Additional Sessions Judge on July 29, 1999 had convicted the petitioner u/s 302, IPC and had sentenced him to life imprisonment with regards to an incident which took place on July 26, 1997. In the cause title of the said judgment and order, the petitioner was as Ashok, S/o Balram Jatab age 16 yrs 9 months and 19 days, R/o Village Anjani Pura, District Bhind. 
Aggrieved the petitioner had filed a Criminal Appeal challenging his conviction and sentence which was dismissed by the High Court dated November 14, 2017.
The petitioner claimed that the petitioner was born on January 5, 1981 and was therefore, approximately 16 years and 7 months old on the date of the incident.
Appearing for the State, the Additional Advocate General, argued that the claim of juvenility was raised for the first time in the special leave petition.
Supreme Court's Observations
"In this Court, the petitioner has for the first time contended that he was a juvenile on the date of the incident. His conviction and sentence are, therefore, liable to be set-aside. The claim of juvenility was not raised in the High Court," bench in its order said.
The bench opined that although it was true that petitioner's certificate was issued on July 17, 2021 but the certificate did not specifically mention that the date of birth January 1, 1982 had been entered at the time of first admission of the petitioner at the primary school level.
"Furthermore, there is a birth certificate issued by the Gram Panchayat, Endouri, District Bhind, Madhya Pradesh which indicates the date of birth of the petitioner as 05.01.1982 and not 01.01.1982 as recorded in the school certificate referred to above. The entry in the records of the Gram Panchayat, Endouri, District Bhind, Madhya Pradesh, also do not appear to be contemporaneous and the certificate has been issued in the year 2017," the Court further added.
Considering that the Trial Court had recorded the petitioner's age as 16 years and odd and had been in actual custody in excess of three years, which was the maximum for a juvenile, the bench granted interim bail to the petitioners on the terms and conditions to be imposed by the Sessions Court. 
The court also directed the Sessions Court to examine the claim of the petitioner to juvenility in accordance with law, and submit a report to this Court within one month from the date of communication of this order.
"The concerned Sessions Court shall be entitled to examine the authenticity and genuineness of the documents sought to be relied upon by the petitioner, considering that the documents do not appear to be contemporaneous," Court added.

The Kerala High Court on Tuesday held that a person born in a particular community cannot be denied community certificate merely for the reason of change in his residence or because his mother and wife belong to another community.
Justice VG Arun opined that to determine the community status of a person, enquiry must be conducted about the caste to which the applicant is born and how he was brought up and the mere fact that he changed residence or married a belonging to another caste, are not determining factors. It observed,
"The fact that the petitioner's mother belongs to Hindu-Ezhava community or his wife is from Ezhava community are not sufficient to hold that the petitioner does not belong to the Hindu-Pallan community. For arriving at such a conclusion, the competent authority should enquire about the caste/community to which the applicant is born, the manner in which he/she was brought up, the practices and customs followed and the acceptance of the incumbent by the caste or a group to which he/she claims to belong etc."
The Court was adjudicating upon a matter where the application for a caste certificate filed by the petitioner, who is born to an inter-caste married couple, was denied citing that his mother belonged to the Ezhava Community.
Counsel appearing for the petitioner, Advocate Varun C Vijay, contended that the impugned decision is ex facie illegal as it was passed without considering the crucial fact that, from birth onwards, the petitioner had grown up as a Hindu-Pallan and this fact is substantiated by the entries in the admission register and the caste certificates issued over the years. He further contended that the caste certificate was denied based on a report submitted by the village officer, in which the only observation highlighted is that the petitioner's wife also belongs to the Ezhava caste.
Refuting the contentions, the Special Government Pleader, Advocate Riyal Devassy submitted that the Tahasildars are not having the competence to decide the community status of a person, instead, KIRTADS is having the expertise. 
The Court pointed out that the fact that the petitioner's community status is shown as Hindu-Pallan in his school records is undisputed. Siding with the contentions raised by the petitioner the court observed that there is no adverse observation in the report submitted by the village officer other than the mere fact that the petitioner shifted his residence and petitioner is married to a person belonging to the Ezhava community does not justify the refusal of issuance of community certificate, contrary to the previous caste certificates issued to the petitioner. 
The Court observed that to determine the community status of a person the competent authority should enquire about the caste/community to which the applicant is born, how he/she was brought up, the practices and customs followed and acceptance of the incumbent by the caste or a group to which he/she claims to belong etc and in the instant case such an inquiry was not conducted. 
The Court while disagreeing with the contention that the petitioner ought to have approached the KIRTADS, observed that only under the circumstances envisaged in Section 9 of the Act an enquiry would be conducted by an expert agency. This includes suo motu enquiries on the basis of field study on caste, on receiving petitions and complaints from any source pertaining to the Scheduled Caste or the Scheduled Tribe, claims of non-Scheduled Castes or on the direction or reference from the state or central government or screening committee.
Thereby, the Court held that a person issued with a community certificate throughout his life, cannot be refused the certificate in a  case where the KIRTADS has not even initiated such enquiry. Disposing of the petition, the Court set aside the impugned orders and directed the issuance of a community certificate.

While deciding the issue of negligence in a claim for motor accident , Supreme Court has observed that if any evidence before the Tribunal runs contrary to the contents in the First Information Report, the evidence which is recorded before the Tribunal has to be given weightage over the contents of the First Information Report.
"If any evidence before the Tribunal runs contrary to the contents in the First Information Report, the evidence which is recorded before the Tribunal has to be given weightage over the contents of the First Information Report", the Supreme Court held in the case National Insurance Company Ltd v. Chamundeswari and others.
A Bench comprising Justice Subhash Reddy and Justice Hrishikesh Roy made this observation while delivering its verdict in an appeal filed by National Insurance Company against Madras High Court's order partly allowing plea filed by wife and son of the deceased who lost his life in a motor vehicle accident, and enhancing compensation to Rs.1,85,08,832.
The observation was made by the Court while responding to Insurance Company's argument that in the First Information Report, it was mentioned that accident occurred only due to negligence by the deceased but such important documentary evidence was ignored by the High Court. 
The Supreme Court noted that the eye witnesses of the accident in the present case were examined and had given their statements before the Tribunal and in view of such evidence on record, there is no reason to give weightage to the contents of the First Information Report.
Brief Facts: 
The respondents in the present case are the wife and the minor son of the deceased who died in a road accident on 14.10.2013. According to them the accident happened when all of a sudden, the driver of Eicher van turned towards right side without giving any signal or indicator, and driver of the Maruti car died and they suffered injuries.
In the Claim Petition moved by them before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, respondents claimed compensation of Rs.3 crores pleading negligence on part of the driver of Eicher van. 
The Claims Tribunal through its order dated 11.12.2017 allowed the claim partly and awarded compensation of Rs.10,40,500 with a finding that there was a contributory negligence on the part of drivers of both the vehicles in ratio of 75% and 25% on the part of the deceased and the driver of Eicher van respectively.
On appeal, the High Court recorded that accident occurred only due to the negligence of the driver of the Eicher van and awarded a total compensation of Rs.1,85,08,832.
The appellant in the matter submitted that the Tribunal had correctly apportioned the negligence on the part of the deceased and the driver of Eicher van, but the same was overturned by the High Court, contrary to the evidence on record.
It was contended that in the First Information Report, it was categorically mentioned that accident occurred only due to negligence by the deceased, and in spite of the same, such important documentary evidence is ignored by the High Court.
The Supreme Court turned down the insurer's appeal observing that the evidence before the Tribunal has to be given weightage over the contents in the FIR.
Case Title: National Insurance Company vs Chamundeswari & Ors.

The Karnataka High Court has said that National Highways Act does not provide for issuing a second award with respect to the land acquired pursuant to Notifications under 3-A and 3-D of the Act.
A single judge bench of Justice E S Indiresh allowed a batch of petitions and set aside the second award by the competent authority dated 22nd January, 2021 and Order dated 27th January, 2021, which granted a lower compensation to the petitioners in lieu of their land.
Senior Advocate G S Kannur appearing for one of the petitioners had argued that pursuant to the acquisition proceedings initiated by the respondent authorities, the authorities had passed the award dated 17th December, 2020 determining the compensation. 
Further, he contended that said award was signed by the competent authority. However, thereafter, the authority issued another award dated 22 January 2021, drastically reducing the compensation. It was argued the said second award is non-est and cannot be accepted.
Reliance was placed on the judgment of the coordinate bench in the case of National Highways V. Assistant Commissioner And Competent Authority, wherein it was held that the authorities have no authority under law to pass second award.
Senior Advocate Udaya Holla appearing for National Highway, contended that the relief sought for by the petitioners is not maintainable in view of the availability of alternative and efficacious remedy under National Highways Act. It was also argued that the award dated 17th December, 2020 is only a draft award.
Findings:
The bench noted that respondent-authorities issued preliminary notification on 09th January, 2020 under Section 3-A of the Act followed by the final Notification dated 10th July, 2020 under Section 3-D of the Act. The competent authority was authorised to effectuate the acquisition proceedings as per Notification dated 27th June, 2014, the bench noted.
"The respondent-authorities issued Notification dated 17th December, 2020, determining the compensation under Section 3-G of the Act, read with Section 29 of the Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013," it added.
The court said it has carefully examined the notification on the first award and found that the same does not mention that it was a draft award.
It added the letter dated 22nd January, 2021, issued by the Special Land Acquisition Officer to the Project Director, National Highways Authority of India, whereby the former has revised the award under Section 3-G of the Act in respect of the land situated in Puttige village of Mudabidri taluk, clearly substantiates the petitioner's arguments that "the award dated 22nd January, 2021, is a second award made by the respondent-authorities in the absence of specific provision under the National Highways Act, providing for making second award with respect to the land acquired pursuant to Notifications under 3-A and 3-D of the Act."
The court said writ petitions deserve to be allowed.
As regards the contention of the respondents that petitioners have alternate remedy to challenge the award the bench said, "The said submission cannot be accepted for the reason the impugned award dated 22nd January, 2021 said to have been issued by the respondent-authorities under section 3- G of the Act upon issuing the earlier award dated 17th December, 2020 (Annexure-D), which creates rights in favour of the petitioners claiming compensation under the Act."
It added, "In that view of the matter, reviewing the very same award by way of impugned award dated 22nd January, 2021 does not arise at all and the same is without jurisdiction and therefore, this Court is having jurisdiction to exercise powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to set right the jurisdictional error on the part of the respondent-authority while issuing second award."
The bench also said that if the instrumentality of the State, has acted in contravention of the statutory provisions which affect the rights of the parties concerned, such illegal and arbitrary action, on the part of authorities, has to be nipped in the bud and cannot be perpetuated since the very action of such authorities is not only an irregularity in nature but also amounts to illegality which cannot be accepted under Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
"In that view of the matter, even if the alternative remedy is available for the petitioners to approach the competent authority under the provisions of the Act, however, the same cannot be said to be an efficacious remedy to nullify such erroneous decision on the part of the respondent authorities," it said.

The Allahabad High Court recently observed that while denying or granting bail to a juvenile under the Juvenile Justice Act, much reliance can not be placed upon a social background or a social investigation report as they are usually prepared without proper research.
"...a social background or a social investigation report may have a very limited purpose to serve. The findings cannot be solely based on such reports, which are more than often very superficial and unscientific. It is common knowledge that social investigation reports are usually prepared in printed formats without proper research. In my opinion, not much reliance can be placed on such half-baked reports," the bench of Justice Jyotsna Sharma remarked as it denied bail to a juvenile accused of committing murder while he was just over 13 years old.
The Court further stressed that the Courts are under obligation to address the concerns of both sides (victim as well the juvenile in conflict with the law) while deciding upon whether or not the ends of justice shall stand defeated in case the juvenile is admitted to bail.
Importantly, noting that cases of juveniles who have allegedly committed a heinous crime and are of the age of above 16 years have been treated differently from those who are found to be of the age of below 16 years in the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, however, the Court stressed, by no stretch of the imagination, it can be said that the Courts are bound to release the juvenile below the age of 16 years once he is found to be of that age and no more.
"...the nature of crime, the manner of commission, the methodology applied, the mental state, the extent of involvement, the evidence available shall be the factors to be taken into account in both the types of cases where the juvenile is below 16 or where the juvenile is above 16. No artificial line can be drawn between the two categories when considering the bail from this particular angle."
The case in brief
As per the version of the FIR, Nitin (deceased) had gone to his college on his bullet motorcycle to receive his report card. When he approached the gate of his college, he found the revisionist (minor) and his brother standing there. He got engaged in some kind of conversation with them. Suddenly, the minor revisionist whipped out a country-made firearm and shot at Nitin. He was referred to Meerut Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries and died.
On finding that the revisionist is a minor, the matter was placed before the Juvenile Justice Board, and the Juvenile was found of the age of little over 13 years and 6 months. The minor applied for bail through his guardian/father but the same was rejected by the Board. The Juvenile Justice Board, Meerut took into consideration the report of the District Probation Officer and made it a sole ground for dismissal of his bail application.
Thereafter, an Appeal was filed against the bail rejection order, the same was also dismissed by the Appellate Court below. Aggrieved by the above two orders, the minor through his guardian/grandfather moved to the High Court in criminal revision.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court observed that the gravity and heinous nature of offence becomes relevant while judging the entitlement of a juvenile to bail under the last of the three disentitling categories (explained below) under Section 12(1) of the Act. 
Here, it may be noted that Sec 12 of the JJ Act clearly authorizes the Juvenile Justice Board to consider a bail plea and to release a juvenile on bail with or without surety or to place under the supervision of a Probation Officer or under the care of any fit person.
This provision further states that such a Juvenile shall not be so released if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that the (i) release is likely to bring the Juvenile into association with any known criminal or (ii) expose the said Juvenile to moral, physical or physiological danger or his (iii) release would defeat the ends of justice.
Here, it may further be noted that initially, all children below the age of 18 years were to be treated as juveniles and tried by the Board. Only after the 2015 Act came into force, a separate category for juveniles between 16 to 18 years involved in the heinous crime, was culled out, who were subjected to a preliminary assessment to ascertain if they are to be tried as a child by the Board or as an adult by the Children's Court under Section 15 of the Act.
Now, the High Court, in the instant case, noted that the allegations against the Juvenile are not important and relevant while granting or denying bail, however, such allegations may assume importance when the Court has to form an opinion about the ends of justice as the Court are under an obligation to address the concerns of both the sides while deciding upon whether or not the ends of justice shall stand defeated in case the juvenile is admitted to bail.
The Court further added that no useful purpose may be served by looking into the background of the offender or as to reasons and circumstances as revealed from the social investigation report, which led him to this juncture or which brought him into such a quagmire.
In this regard, the Court also emphasized that the Court has to rely on its own judicial discretion and objective assessment of things while still going strictly according to the provision of law as to bail and also keeping in mind that the Act has an intertwined approach to a reformatory as well as retributive. 
Regarding the instant case, the Court said that this fact can't be ignored that it was the juvenile who came prepared and armed with a country-made firearm, and though he accompanied his brother, it was he, who fired upon Nitin. The Court also noted that before the commission of the crime, he picked the firearm from his own house indicating that this incident was not committed at the spur of the moment, rather it was planned. 
"The Court is, in such circumstances expected to strike a delicate balance between competing and more often than not, conflicting demands of justice where liberty of an individual is pitted against the larger interest of the society. In such cases, the need for specific supervision of the juvenile and wider need to convert the juvenile into a healthy adult by giving him professional counseling and behavioral therapy under the scheme of the Act cannot be underestimated. Moreover, it may be necessary to keep him away from the company of elements, which he previously had," the Court further remarked as it denied bail to the Juvenile in question.
Case title - Minor Son Of Moolchand Through His Natural Guardian Grandfather Ved Prakash v. State Of U.P. And Another [CRIMINAL REVISION No. - 2126 of 2021]

The Allahabad High Court has recently observed that the High Court of one State can grant transit bail in respect of a case registered within the jurisdiction of another High Court in the exercise of power under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
"...there is no fetter on the part of the High Court in granting a transit anticipatory bail to enable the applicants to approach the Courts including High Courts where the offence is alleged to have been committed and the case is registered," the Court stressed.
With this, the bench of Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan granted transit anticipatory bail to a man booked under Sections 406 & 420 IPC in connection with a case registered in Maharashtra. 
For context, the concept of "transit anticipatory bail" comes into the picture when a person is apprehending arrest by police of a State other than the State where he/she is presently situated. As the word "transit" suggests, it is an act of being moved or carried from one place to another.
In plain words, when an accused is arrested in accordance with the order of the court and whereas the accused needs to be tried in some other competent court having jurisdiction in the aforementioned matter, the accused is given bail for the transitory period i.e., the time period required for the accused to reach that competent court from the place he is arrested in.
In the instant case, accused Ajay Agarwal is a businessman dealing with safety products, who has been implicated in a case registered in the state of Maharashtra related to some commercial transaction. He moved the Court with the instant plea with the submission that since the investigation is going on in Maharashtra, therefore, he is required to participate in such investigation in Maharashtra, and since, he is apprehensive of his arrest, thus, he should be granted transit bail till the time he applies for bail before the proper jurisdictional court.
At the outset, the Court noted that transit bail is protection from arrest for a certain definite period as granted by the Court granting such transit bail. The Court stressed that the mere fact that an accused has been granted transit bail, does not mean that the regular court, under whose jurisdiction the case would fall, would extend such transit bail and would convert such transit bail into anticipatory bail. 
The Court clarified that upon the grant of transit bail, the accused person, who has been granted such transit bail, has to apply for anticipatory bail before the regular court and such court would consider such plea anticipatory bail, on its own merits. 
Now, against this backdrop, noting that the commercial transaction ensued between the applicants and the complainant and there are criminal cases lodged by the parties against each other and thus, the Court found it to be a fit case where the applicant should get the privilege of transit pre-arrest bail.
Hence, the Court directed that in the event of arrest of applicant/Ajay Agarwal, he shall be released on transit bail on executing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of the like amount. This protection has been granted for a period of six weeks.

The Karnataka High Court has held that it is the duty of the authorities to ensure that the footways and public streets are kept free of obstructions including illegal parking thereon. It is also their responsibility to ensure that violations of the aforesaid provisions of law are not taken casually and criminal law is promptly set in motion.
 A division bench of Chief Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj, relying on the order passed by the court on 31st July 2019 in W.P.No.42927/2015, said "This Court has held that a right to have streets including footways in a good and reasonable condition will have to be held as an essential part of the fundamental rights conferred on the citizens under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. If the footways or public streets are encroached upon in any manner including by parking of vehicles, it will amount to violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India as held by this Court."
 The court has also directed the state government and the traffic Police Department to make effective implementation of the provisions contained in Sections 117, 122, 127, 177A and 201 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, on a complaint made by a citizen or otherwise. If any violation of the said provisions is made, apart from taking action of removal of illegally stopped, parked or abandoned vehicles on footways, criminal law must be set in motion immediately.
 It added "The respondents shall ensure strict implementation of the provisions of the Karnataka Traffic Control Act, of 1960 and the Karnataka Traffic Control Rules of 1979."
 Further, it said "It is the duty of the State Government and its agencies and instrumentalities to ensure that the relevant provisions under the M.V. Act, the said Act of 1960, the rules framed under the said Act of 1960 as well as the Regulations framed under Section 118 of the M.V.
 Act concerning footways are strictly implemented. They shall ensure that criminal law is promptly set in motion against the offenders and violators;
 The court has directed the State Government as well as the BBMP to issue directions to its officers for the purpose of implementation of the above directions within a period of six weeks.
 The court opined that all the penal provisions which we have discussed above must be scrupulously enforced by all the concerned. It said "Unless the penal provisions are properly enforced, the aforesaid provisions of law will remain only on paper."
 It concluded by saying "Non implementation of the aforesaid provisions which we have discussed in the body of the judgment may even amount to violation of right to life guaranteed to the citizens under Article 21 of the Constitution of India."
 Court suggests increasing the fine amount
 A reference was made to Section 18 of the Karnataka Traffic Control Act of 1960 under which any violation of the provisions of the said Act of 1960 or of any Rule made thereunder is an offence. The court said "Unfortunately, a very mild punishment is prescribed of fine which may extend to ten rupees or in case of successive offence, it may extend to fifty rupees.
 Accordingly it suggested "This is a legislation of 1960. We hope and trust that the Legislature will consider whether Section 18 needs an amendment for providing for stringent punishments."
 The order was passed while disposing of a petition filed by Advocate D. S. RAMACHANDRA REDDY inviting the attention of the Court to the encroachments made on foot paths/ footways in a particular location in Bengaluru city. Further, seeking a direction of the court for making a particular street for one-way street and for ensuring that all road signals are erected.

Observing that the medieval notion of the wife being the 'property of the husband to do as he wishes, still persists,' the Bombay High Court refused to show any leniency to a man convicted for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
 Justice Revati Mohite Dere held the husband's contention that his wife, by refusing to make tea, offered a grave and sudden provocation to be "ludicrous," "clearly untenable and unsustainable."
 The wife, struck by her husband with a hammer for suspecting her character and refusing to make tea had eventually succumbed to her injuries.
 "Such cases, reflect the imbalance of gender – skewed patriarchy, the socio-cultural milieu one has grown up in, which often seeps into a marital relationship. There is imbalance of gender roles, where wife as a homemaker is expected to do all the household chores."
 Justice Dere further observed that the emotional labour in a marriage is expected to be done by the wife. 
 "Coupled with these imbalances in the equation, is the imbalance of expectation and subjugation, Social conditions of women also make them handover themselves to their spouses. Thus, men, in such cases, consider themselves as primary partners and their wives, `chattel'."
 "This medieval notion of the wife being the property of the husband to do as he wishes, unfortunately, still persists in the majority mindset. Nothing but notions of patriarchy."
 Justice Dere quoted from, 'The Man Who Mistook His Wife For Chattel' by Margo Wilson and Martin
 Daly: "By `proprietary', we mean first that men lay claim to particular women as songbirds lay claim to territories, as lions lay claim to a kill, or as people of both sexes lay claim to valuables. Having located an individually recognizable and potentially defensible resource packet, the proprietary creature proceeds to advertise and exercise the intention of defending it from rivals. Proprietariness has the further implication, possibly peculiar to the human case, of a sense of right or entitlement".
 The court relied heavily on the testimonies of the couple's six-year-old daughter, an extra judicial confession to the wife's uncle and recovery of a blood stained hammer. The child had witnessed the incident, while the husband had told the uncle that he struck his wife with a hammer. 
 The trial court's judge had discarded the child's testimony as it was recorded 10-12 days after the incident.
 Justice Dere noted that the child's statement may have been recorded five days after her mother's demise and her statement under section 164 of the CrPC nearly 15 days thereafter, but she hasn't buckled under cross examination. The trauma of a child losing a loved one in such a brutal way, will have to be borne in mind, the court said.
 The child had witnessed her parents quarrelling, her father striking her mother on the head, cleaning the blood off her mother and taking her to the hospital thereafter.
 "It will have to be borne in mind, first the trauma of a young child, aged 6 years on seeing her mother being assaulted by her father; the trauma of seeing not only the assault but of seeing her mother lying there for an hour, during which, her father (appellant) gave her mother a bath, to clean the blood and also cleaned the spot."
 Jusitce Dere said that the man could have saved his wife's life had he not wasted an hour cleaning up the blood. 
 "If the appellant had rushed Manisha to the hospital, soon after the incident, possibly her life could have been saved and Rohini would not have lost her mother ."
 Background 
 It was the case of the prosecution that 35-year-old Santosh Mahadev Atkar, a resident of Vitthal Hospital Servant Quarter, in Solapur district of Maharashtra would have frequent quarrels with his wife as he suspected she was cheating on him. 
 On December 19, 2013 at about 6:00 a.m the victim Manisha was leaving her house, without preparing tea, due to which the couple had a fight and Atkar assaulted his wife on her head with a hammer from the back. 
 The accused then gave his wife a bath and wiped the blood-stains from the spot, He took her to the hospital only thereafter. Manisha's condition was critical and she was unable to speak. She finally succumbed to her injurie on December 25, 2013. 
 On July 1, 2016 Additional Sessions Judge, Pandharpur convicted Atkar under sections 304 (II) of the IPC and sentenced him to 10 years in prison along with a fine of Rs 5000. 
 The court was hearing his appeal against conviction. 
 "Considering the overwhelming evidence on record pointing to the complicity, no infirmity can be found in the impugned judgment and order convicting and sentencing the appellant for the offences mentioned in para 2 hereinabove. The facts on record also do not warrant any reduction in the sentence awarded to the appellant. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed."

The Allahabad High Court recently granted bail to a POCSO Accused who ran away with a 14-year-old girl (victim) due to a romantic affair between them. The Court noted that both of them fled away, got married in a Temple, and remained in company with each other for almost two years during which the girl even gave birth to a baby.
The Bench of Justice Rahul Chaturvedi also remarked that it would be extremely harsh and inhuman to devoid the baby from parental love and affection on account of the fact that both the accused and minor victim loved each other and decided to get married.
The Court, in a significant clarification also said that the scheme of the POCSO Act clearly shows that it did not intend to bring within its scope or limits, the cases of the nature where the adolescents or teenagers are involved in a dense romantic affair.
The case in brief
In November 2019, the father of the minor girl lodged an FIR against the Accused/bail applicant (Atul Mishra) with the specific allegation that his minor daughter was enticed away by him. He was later on booked u/s 363, 366, 376 I.P.C.; ¾ of POCSO Act, 2012 and 3(2)v, 3(2)va of the SC/ST Act.
Eventually, after almost one year, after getting a tip from the informer, police arrested the victim and her small baby in her lap along with the applicant from east of the by-pass. Since on the date of the incident the victim was a minor, all the authorities at the subordinate level, sent her to Shelter Hom in Prayagraj and the applicant was sent to jail. 
The Additional Sessions Judge/ Special Judge (POCSO Act), Fatehpur rejected the bail application moved on behalf of the applicant, in November 2021, and hence, he moved the instant bail application before the Court.
Court's observations
At the outset, the Court observed that on the date of the incident, the victim was a minor girl and her 'consent' as contemplated u/s 375/376 I.P.C. has got no value in the eyes of law, however, the Court further noted that the applicability of any statutory penal provision is not a mathematical exposition or theorem and thus, it can't be applied like that.
Continuing further, the Court stressed that there are certainly gray areas, where the severity of the sentences provided under the POCSO Act, rightly so be diluted keeping in view the facts of each case. In this regard, the Court observed thus:
"If these rigors of the enactment is pasted hastily or irresponsibly, it could lead to irreparable damage to the reputation and future of young whose actions would have been only innocuous and may lead to spoiling the future life of that innocent lovers or couple who out of sheer innocence have initially developed and thereafter established that relationship...Growing incidences where teenagers and young adults fall victim of the offences under the POCSO Act, being slapped by the penal provisions of POCSO Act without understanding the far-reaching implication of the severity of the enactment, is an issue that brings much concern to the conscience of this Court"
Importantly, the Court, in its order, also remarked that the decision of such couples could be impulsive, immature but certainly not sinful or tainted as branded in the F.I.R. or complaint of the informant.
"It is crucial to accept the science and psychology of an adolescent and young adulthood at this juncture. This is because social and biological phenomenons are widely recognised as determinates of human development, health and socio-economic attainment across the life course, but our understanding of the underlying pathways and processes remains limited. Therefore, a 'bio-social approach' needs to be adopted and appreciated i.e. one that conceptualizes the biological and social requirements of two teenagers, who on account of mutual infatuation are attracted and decide for their future."
Court's order
Reverting to the facts of the case, the Court noted that in the instant case, the teens had decided to enter into a nuptial knot and now they have a baby out of this relationship, therefore, the Court held that the rigors of the POCSO Act would not come in their way.
The Court also took into account the fact that the girl was not sexually abused or no sexual assault was made upon her, nor she had been sexually harassed by the applicant, as contemplated by the object of the POCSO Act.
Therefore, stressing that it is extremely harsh and inhuman to devoid their baby from parental love and affection, the Court granted him bail while noting that his wife (victim girl) had shown her willingness to reside with him.
However, to secure the future of the girl and baby, the Court did put out a condition that after the release on bail, the applicant shall produce a bank draft of Rs. 5 lacs in favor of his wife and her baby, which shall be handed over to the victim before the court within a period of six months from the date of his release on bail.
Lastly, the In-Charge of Rajkiya Balgrih (Balika) Khuldabad, Prayagraj was directed to release the victim with her baby forthwith.

Noting that the prosecution, as a matter of routine, does not lay emphasis on the production of independent witnesses during the course of the trial, the Allahabad High Court recently observed that the failure of the investigating agency to record statements of such witnesses during an investigation must be viewed seriously by the courts of law.
Dealing with a criminal appeal against a murder conviction where no independent witnesses were examined or produced, the Bench of Justice Attau Rahman Masoodi and Justice Manish Kumar was of the further opinion that, that time is not far when the courts may have to invoke the suo motu powers to summon such witnesses for which there ought to exist a witness protection law.
The case in brief
Essentially, the bench was dealing with a criminal appeal of 4 appellants who had moved the court challenging their conviction under Section 302 read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to them by Additional District and Session Judge, Unnao.
One of the accused, Ashwani Kumar was further convicted under Section 404 IPC and under Section 3 r/w Section 25 of Arms Act. The conviction was in connection with a 1999 case, wherein one Ram Naresh Gaur and his son, Anil Kumar were killed by the appellants.
The murder was committed over an altercation that took place as the appellants took their tractor through the land/orchard belonging to the deceased, while they were digging out potatoes in their field.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court noted that there was an inconsistency between the ocular evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 as PW-1, in his cross-examination clearly stated that the first fire on the date of occurrence was shot by Ram Naresh (deceased), while PW-2 said that the first fire was shot by Ashwini Kumar (Accused).
The second contradiction noted by the Court was between the oral testimony of eye witness PW-2 and PW-10. While PW-2 said that Ram Naresh (deceased) after reaching the police station, was taken to the hospital by Jeep, the version of PW-10, in his cross-examination, was that Ram Naresh (deceased) was taken to the hospital by the same tractor he was brought to the police station.
Apart from the contradictions mentioned above, the appellants also pointed out the ambiguity in the site plan
Further, the appellants, without formally taking the ground, took the plea before the High Court that it was a case of culpable homicide within the scope of Section 300 Exception IV IPC for which the sentence of life imprisonment being maximum is disproportionate.
[Note: Exception IV to Section 300 of IPC states that Culpable homicide is not murder, if it is committed without premeditation, in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offenders having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner]
In this regard, noting that the plea of self defence on an exception appended to Section-300 IPC on the strength of evidence available on record is open to be raised at the appellate stage, observed thus:
"According to the ocular evidence of PW-1, it is clear that the first fire was opened by Ram Naresh (deceased) which, by no stretch of imagination, could be viewed less than life threatening by the appellants, who in retaliation resorted to use the fire arms and caused a fatal injury to him. The threat to life was equally imminent to the appellants, when Anil Kumar bent to pick up the gun which fell down from the hands of Ram Naresh on receiving injury. The provocation for sudden fight and quarrel was triggered by the deceased who protested by advancing towards the accused and the heat of passion multiplied on his opening the first fire and this position is well established on a prudent reading of the testimony of PW-1 (Anand Mohan)"
Further, the Court said that it would not be prudent to import the element of common intention in a situation of sudden fight or quarrel saddled by provocation or aggression as in the case at hand, therefore, the Court held that the evidence on record clearly brought the case within the field of Exception-IV appended to Section 300 IPC and thus, the benefit of Section 304 Part-I becomes applicable.
Importantly, the Court was also of the opinion that in the instant case, the investigation, evidence, or site plan didn't offer any explanation of the tractor loaded with potatoes that was attempted to be brought and driven through the land of deceased 
"The independent witnesses were neither produced nor their position is shown in the site plan unlike appellants", added the Court.
Lastly, the Court noted that the appellants have already served the sentence for more than 17 years and that one of the appellants (Parshuram Pasi) has died during the pendency of appellate proceedings while incarceration.
Therefore, the conviction of the appellants under Section 302 IPC was modified as conviction under Section 304 Part-I IPC and the substantive sentence of life imprisonment was reduced to the period of sentence already undergone by them.

The Gujarat High Court on Wednesday granted interim bail to an accused/husband, his relatives on a joint plea filed by him and his complainant-wife seeking quashing of an FIR under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021 ['Anti Love Jihad' law].
The Bench Of Justice Ilesh J. Vora was hearing the joint plea of the interfaith couple submitting that the issues have been resolved and that they wish to continue with their marital relationship.
Earlier, three of the accused were granted bail, however, four remained in judicial custody, who have now been granted bail by the High Court.
The plea before the Court
As per the contents of the FIR, the woman had earlier alleged that her husband, his parents, and the priests who performed the matrimonial ceremony had forcibly converted her religion through marriage.
However, moving before the High Court in June 2021 with a plea to quash FIR, she/wife claimed that she had approached a local police station in Vadodara to report petty and trivial matrimonial discord, however, the police, on their own, brought in the "love jihad" angle and they inserted the allegations in the FIR which she did not even make
Importantly, the complainant-woman had categorically submitted before the Court that the FIR had been registered by Police bringing in the Love-Jihad angle on their own and that it contained grossly incorrect and untrue facts, particularly regarding the allegations of forceful conversion.
The Bench of Justice Ilesh J Vora was earlier told by the woman that she wished to live with her husband as a married couple and therefore, the FIR which was registered against her husband under the 'Anti Love-Jihad' law be quashed.
The petition had also stated that the woman had never complained of the offences pertaining to IPC, Freedom of Religion Act and Atrocities Act and still, the FIR was registered under Section 323, 498 (A), 376 (2) (n), 377, 312, 313, 504, 506 (2), 120B and 419 of IPC and Sections 4, 4 (a), 4 (2) (a), 4 (2) (b) and 5 of Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021 and certain offences under the SC/ST Prevention of atrocities act.
In fact, her plea also mentioned the fact that she and her husband, both were in a relationship for 2 years and were aware of each other's religion before they decided to marry each other as per the Islamic rites.
It was also averred in the plea that her marriage was firstly notarised and subsequently it was registered under the Special Marriage Act and that the girl's father stood as a witness in their marriage.
Court's order 
The Court, while granting the bail, observed that the Gujarat High Court has recently stayed, as interim order, certain provisions of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021.
Importantly, the Court had, on August 19, ruled that pending further hearing, the rigours of Section 3, 4, 4A to 4C, 5, 6, and 6A shall not operate merely because marriage is solemnized by a person of one religion with another religion without force or allurement or fraudulent means and such marriages cannot be termed as marriages for the purposes of unlawful conversion.
Further, considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, more particularly the settlement arrived at between the husband and wife i.e. informant and accused no.1, the Court noted that the petitioners have made out a prima-facie case for interim relief in the nature of bail.
Thus, without entering into merits of the case, the Court observed that it was a fit case to exercise discretion under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to grant relief. 
"...considering the nature of dispute, severity of punishment and in absence of any past antecedents of like nature and as there is no possibility of fleeing from justice, the discretion is required to be exercised," the Court held while granting bail to the accused husband and some of his relatives.
Read order

The Delhi High Court has upheld the dismissal of a police head constable who was caught with 75 dirhams while on duty of checking passengers' passports at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in 1996, observing that the police officers who break law must be "dealt with iron hands."
Calling it an "open and shut case", a division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad said possession of foreign currency in head constable's pocket at the time of surprise check along with statements of witnesses "clearly establishes misconduct committed by him."
"In the present case, this Court is dealing with Police personnel who is supposed to be the custodian of law and whose duty is to ensure that people are following the law of the land. If such a person himself breaks the law, he has to be dealt with iron hands, and, therefore, in the considered opinion of this Court no other punishment except dismissal could have been inflicted upon him in the facts and circumstances of the case," the court said in response to an argument that punished levied was extensively harsh and disproportionate. 
The bench dismissed a plea moved by head constable Suresh Kumar against an order of Central Administration Tribunal upholding his dismissal from service. 
Kumar, who was posted at the IGI airport in March 1996, was found in possession of foreign currency after a surprise check was conducted by Deputy Commissioner of Police. Two cops including Kumar were accused of collecting money from the passengers during the passport checking.
A joint enquiry was ordered against Kumar and ASI Jagmal Singh, who was also present on duty at the same time. On September 20 in 1999, the Disciplinary Authority dismissed them from service. Kumar's appeal was dismissed by Commissioner of Police in 2002. The CAT upheld the decision of the police department. 
Rejecting the argument that there was no evidence of bribery against Kumar, the High Court said:
"This Court has taken into account all the grounds raised by the Petitioner and by no stretch of imagination can it be said that the present case is a case of no evidence. It is an undisputed fact that 75 Dirhams were recovered from the Petitioner at the time when the search took place and the Petitioner was certainly not a traveler who came from some foreign country, thereby being in possession of Dirhams."
The bench thus upheld the orders passed by Disciplinary Authority, Appellate Authority and CAT in view of no procedural irregularity or violation of principle of natural justice and fair play.
Title: SURESH KUMAR v. CP & ORS.

The Allahabad High Court has recently held that Marriage Certificates issued by Arya Samaj have no statutory force. It was further held that in the absence of a valid marriage, the marriage certificate of Arya Samaj is not proof of a valid marriage.
The observation came from the bench of Justice Surya Prakash Kesarwani and Justice Rajendra Kumar-IV which was dealing with a first appeal filed by one Ashish Morya challenging an order of the Principal Judge, Family Court, Saharanpur dismissing his application filed under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.
Mourya had essentially filed a Section 9 HMA application seeking restitution of conjugal rights with the defendant, who he claimed to be his wife. However, the defendant-respondent clearly denied any marriage between her and the plaintiff-appellant. 
The plaintiff/appellant claimed that both of them got married by following the rituals of Arya Samaj, and presented an Arya Samaj Trust marriage certificate, however, the Court refused to accept the factum of marriage as it noted that the plaintiff failed to place before the Court any statutory provisions enabling Arya Samaj to issue a marriage certificate.
"Learned counsel for the plaintiff-appellant has also completely failed to place before us any statutory provisions enabling the Arya Samaj to issue a marriage certificate. Thus, we have no difficulty holding that the Marriage Certificate issued by Arya Samaj has no statutory force...in the absence of a valid marriage, the marriage certificate of Arya Samaj is not proof of a valid marriage of the plaintiff-appellant and the defendant-respondent." the Court said.
The Court further noted that the plaintiff/appellant had neither led any evidence nor filed any certificate of marriage as proof of marriage under Section 8 of HMA,1955 read with the Uttar Pradesh Hindu Marriage Registration Rules, 1973, or the Uttar Pradesh Registration of Marriage Rules, 2017.
The Court also observed that as per Section 7 of the 1955 Act, a Hindu marriage may be solemnized in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party thereto and that where such rites and ceremonies include the Saptapadi i.e. the taking of seven steps by the bridegroom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire, the marriage becomes complete and binding when the seventh step is taken. 
In view of this, the Court noted that it was an admitted case of the plaintiff/appellant that the rites and ceremonies of Saptapadi had not taken place in the alleged marriage of the plaintiff with the defendant on 29.06.2021 and therefore, the court said that factum of the marriage was not proved.
As far as his plea for restitution of conjugal rights was concerned, the Court noted that since there was no proof of valid marriage, therefore, the court below had not committed any error of law to dismiss the suit.
"In our view, the existence of a valid marriage is a precondition to ask for relief of restitution of conjugal rights. In the absence of proof of a valid marriage, under the facts and circumstances of the case; the court below has not committed any error of law to dismiss the suit observing that merely getting a marriage certificate from Arya Samaj is not proof of a valid marriage," the Court noted as it dismissed the appeal.

 The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh has ordered the reopening of the infamous Nadimarg Massacre Case, after a decade, by recalling an order dated December 21, 2011 whereby the criminal revision petition in the matter was dismissed.
The case relates to massacre of 24 Kashmiri Pandits by militant groups at Nadimarg village in Shopian district in 2003. Seven persons were arraigned as accused in the matter. However, prosecution's plea to examine material witnesses on commission, citing threat perception, was dismissed by both the trial court was well as the High Court through the impugned order. 
 A bench comprising Justice Sanjay Dhar on Wednesday noted that the criminal revision petition was dismissed primarily because nobody had appeared on behalf of the State. It remarked,
"A criminal revision petition cannot be dismissed for non-prosecution...this Court does have jurisdiction to recall an order which is a nullity in the eyes of law." 
After the incident, a case (FIR No.24/2003) for offences under Sections 302, 450, 395, 307, 120-B, 326, 427 RPC, 7/27 Arms Act and Section 30 Police Act) was registered in Police Station, Zainapora in connection with massacre and investigations were taken up.
 Counsel for the petitioners contended that that the impugned order was sought to be recalled as it was passed without hearing the petitioner and without adverting to the merits of the case.
 Contesting the plea, the respondents countered by arguing that that a criminal court has no jurisdiction to review its own order in view of the specific bar contained in Section 369 of the J&K Cr.P.C, which is applicable to the instant case.
 Findings:
 While Justice Dhar agreed that a Criminal Court including the High Court, in exercise of its criminal jurisdiction, does not have power to review its own order however, he added that a criminal revision petition cannot be dismissed for non-prosecution. 
Justice Dhar further recorded that though the High Court, while dismissing the Criminal Revision Petition had observed that the order of the trial court is well-reasoned and does not call for interference, but the fact of the matter remains that the Court was persuaded to dismiss the revision petition, primarily, because nobody had appeared on behalf of the State. The impugned order does not specify the reasons as to why the revision petition lacks merit, the bench noted.
 The bench explained that a criminal matter cannot be dismissed for default and that it must be decided on merits because such matters relate to administration of criminal justice. 
 In order to buttress the said position the bench also found it necessary to record the observations of Supreme court in State of Punjab vs. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar and others, (2011) wherein SC while while examining the bar to review/alteration of a judgment, in view of the provisions contained in Section 362 of the Central Cr. P. C, which is in pari materia with Section 369 of the J&K Cr. P. C, observed:
 " If a judgment has been pronounced without jurisdiction or in violation of principles of natural justice or where the order has been pronounced without giving an opportunity of being heard to a party affected by it or where an order was obtained by abuse of the process of court which would really amount to its being without jurisdiction, inherent powers can be exercised to recall such order for the reason that in such an eventuality the order becomes a nullity and the provisions of Section 362 Cr.P.C. would not operate. In such eventuality, the judgment is manifestly contrary to the audi alteram partem rule of natural justice. The power of recall is different from the power of altering/reviewing the judgment"
 The bench thus recalled the impugned order and directed the Registry to post the revision petition for rehearing on September 15.

Finding that a judgment delivered by a Division Bench of the High Court in the year 2020 isn't the correct law, the Rajasthan High Court on Thursday held that failure of a prisoner to surrender to the prison authorities on completion of parole period would amount to escape from the lawful custody of the State and that ordinarily such prisoner would not be entitled to be transferred to Open Air Camp as per Rajasthan Prisoners Open Air Camp Rules.
 The three-judge bench comprising Justice Vinit Kumar Mathur, Justice Pushpendra Singh Bhati, and Justice Vijay Bishnoi was dealing with a question referred to it by the Chief Justice in view of two contradictory and opposing rulings by two different division benches of the High Court.
 The question and the rulings of the Division benches
 The Larger Bench had been constituted under the orders of Hon'ble The Chief Justice for answering the following question: - 
 "Whether non-surrendering of a prisoner to the prison authorities after expiry of the period of parole would amount to escape from lawful custody and therefore, ordinarily, such prisoner would not be entitled to be transferred to Open Air Camp, on account of inhibition contained in Rule 3(c) of the Rules of 1972 ?"
 The Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Dinesh Mehta had, last year, in Yogesh Kumar Devangan vs. State and Ors. (DBCr.WP No.541/2019) held that the act of the prisoner in not reporting to the Jail Authorities on completion of his parole can't be equated with the case of the prisoners, who have escaped from the jails or have attempted to do so and also held that the Rule 3(c) of the Rules of 1972 cannot be taken up as an absolute bar and it is upon the Advisory Committee to consider the application after due application of mind on merits. 
 However, another Division Bench of the Court was not agreeable to this view and therefore, the instant three-bench had been constituted.
 What does Rajasthan Prisoners Open Air Camp Rules, 1972 say?
 As per rule 3 (c), persons who have escaped from the jails or who have attempted to escape from lawful custody are ineligible for admission to open-air camp.
Also, rule 4 is related to Eligibility for admission to Open Camps and it says that a prisoner shall be eligible for admission to an Open-Air Camp, if he does not fall within any of the categories specified in rule 3.
 Now, a conjoint reading of both the rules would make it obvious that in case a prisoner escapes the lawful custody, he/she shall not be eligible for admission to open-air camp.
 Against this backdrop, the Court had to decide if a person who doesn't return/surrender to the prison authorities on the completion of his parole period, can it be said that he/she had escaped the lawful custody of the state.
 Court's observations
 At the outset, the Court observed that if a prisoner, who is out of prison or jail premises on parole, is held to be in lawful custody of State then he/she would become ineligible for admission to open air camp (if he/she jumps parole) in the light of Rule 3(c) of the Rules of 1972.
 However, if he/she can't be said to be under state's lawful custody while out on parole, the Court added, the inhibition contained in Rule 3(c) of Rules of 1972 will not affect the entitlement of a prisoner for his admission in Open Air Camp, even he/she jumps parole.
 Against this backdrop, the Court referred to Apex Court's ruling in the case of Sunil Fulchand Shah vs. Union of India (UOI) and Ors AIR 2000 SC 1023, wherein it was held that a prisoner released on parole, remains in legal custody of the State.
 "Even while on parole, the prisoner continues to serve the sentence or undergo the period of detention in a different manner than from being in jail. He cannot be termed as a free person," the Court noted referring to Sunil Fulchand (supra).
 Importantly, the Court also referred to Sections 418 & 419 of CrPC, Form No.34 appended to the Second Schedule of CrPC and Section 55 of the Prisons Act, 1894 to conclude thus:
 "A prisoner while out of prison or jail premises on parole will remain in the lawful custody of the State… So even if a prisoner is outside the jail or prison on parole, by virtue of Section 55 of the Act of 1894 he shall be deemed to be in prison and subjected to all the same incidents as applicable to a prisoner detained in a jail or prison. Needless to say, a prisoner detained in jail or prison is always in lawful custody of State until proved otherwise."
 Accordingly, the court answered the question of law referred for adjudication in the following manner:
 The answer to the question of law referred for adjudication is in the affirmative. The view expressed by Division Bench of this Court in Yogesh Kumar Devangan vs. State and Ors. (supra) is not the correct law. Failure of a prisoner to surrender to the prison authorities on completion of parole period would amount to escape from the lawful custody of the State and ordinarily such prisoner would not be entitled to be transferred to Open Air Camp as per Rule 3(c) of the Rules of 1972.

"It is incomprehensible why Scheduled Private Banks in India should be preferred to Scheduled Foreign Banks in India with high global rating, even though, some Scheduled Private Sector Banks have not even been running well".Justice Indira Banerjee of the Supreme Court has observed in a dissenting judgment that it is incomprehensible why bank guarantee from Scheduled Private Banks in India should be preferred to Scheduled Foreign Banks in India with high global rating, even though, some Scheduled Private Sector Banks have not even been running well. The bench of Justice Indira Banerjee and V. Ramasubramanian...
Justice Indira Banerjee of the Supreme Court has observed in a dissenting judgment that it is incomprehensible why bank guarantee from Scheduled Private Banks in India should be preferred to Scheduled Foreign Banks in India with high global rating, even though, some Scheduled Private Sector Banks have not even been running well. 
The bench of Justice Indira Banerjee and V. Ramasubramanian was considering appeals against the High Court order refusing to accept a legally valid irrevocable Bank Guarantee of Rs.30 Crores, issued by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited, Mumbai, which is a Scheduled Bank included in the Second Schedule of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, and insisting that the Appellant should furnish a fresh Bank Guarantee of the same amount, with identical terms, issued by a "Scheduled Indian Bank", notwithstanding the expenditure incurred by the Appellant in obtaining the Bank Guarantee from ICBC. The Delhi High Court had passed this order in an Arbitration appeal filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.
While Justice Banerjee allowed the appeal, Justice Ramasubramanian observed that the Special Leave Petitions should be dismissed since there is no substantial question of law warranting the interference under Article 136 of the Constitution. Therefore, now the appeal is referred to Chief Justice of India for appropriate directions.
Referring to the provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, Justice Banerjee observed:
"55. It is incomprehensible why Scheduled Private Banks in India should be preferred to Scheduled Foreign Banks in India with high global rating, even though, some Scheduled Private Sector Banks have not even been running well. It would perhaps not be out of place to take judicial notice of reports that in March, 2020, Yes Bank, a private Sector bank, which was on the brink of complete financial collapse, had to be placed under a moratorium by RBI. Yes Bank has been cited by this Court as an example only to illustrate the fallacy of insistence upon the Bank Guarantee of a Scheduled Indian Bank in preference to that of Scheduled Foreign Bank in India, and not to cast any aspersion on the present functioning of Yes bank or any other Scheduled Bank in the Private Sector in India."
The judge observed that a Court has the discretion to insist on a Bank Guarantee from any specific bank or class of banks to safeguard the interests of the beneficiary of the Bank Guarantee. "The Court may legitimately disapprove a Bank Guarantee of a bank with a history which raises doubts with regard to its credibility. In this case, there is nothing on record to give rise to any doubts with regard to the credibility of ICBC or its financial ability or willingness to honour guarantees.", she added.
The bench noted that ICBC is not only a Scheduled Bank in India, but it also ranks very high in terms of asset value in atleast three extremely authoritative lists being 'The Banker's Top 1000 World Banks 2018', 'The Forbes Global 2000 2019' and 'The Fortune Global 500 Sub-list of Commercial Banks'.
According to Justice Ramasubramanian, the question whether there exists statutorily, a distinction between "a Scheduled Indian Bank" and "a Scheduled Bank located in India" does not arise for consideration in this case. 
"23. In my humble considered view, these special leave petitions do not deserve to be entertained under Article 136 of the Constitution of India in view of the fact (i) that the very same Judge who passed the first Order dated 12.02.2019, clarified the same by his subsequent Order dated 09.04.2019; (ii) that the same learned Judge dismissed on 16.05.2019, the petition to recall the Order dated 09.04.2019; (iii) that the Commercial Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the appeal arising out of the Order dated 16.05.2019; and (iv) that the Commercial Division Bench again reiterated its orders, by dismissing the review petition. We must remember that all this arose out of an interim measure under Section 9 of the Act and the petitioner is seeking to upset all of this in a petition under Article 136 of the Constitution as though there is a substantial question of law of great importance.", the judge said.

The Supreme Court observed that the trial courts shall endeavor to complete the examination of the private witnesses both chief and cross on the same day as far as possible. "We would expect the trial courts to take up the examination of the private witnesses first, before proceeding with that of the official witnesses", the bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh said...
The Supreme Court observed that the trial courts shall endeavor to complete the examination of the private witnesses both chief and cross on the same day as far as possible. 
"We would expect the trial courts to take up the examination of the private witnesses first, before proceeding with that of the official witnesses", the bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh said while disposing of a criminal appeal. The court noted that long adjournments given after the completion of the chief examination, only helps the defense to win them over at times, with the passage of time.
In this case, one of the witnesses spoke about the incident in his chief examination. In cross examination, which was conducted after some days, he disputed the very factum of his chief examination made before the court. The accused were convicted by the Trial Court. In appeal, the High Court sentenced them to life imprisonment. 
While dismissing their appeal, the Apex Court bench noted that in Vinod Kumar v. State of Punjab, (2015) 3 SCC 220, it had already dealt with a situation where a witness after rendering testimony in line with the prosecution's version, completely abandoned it, in view of the long adjournments given permitting an act of manoeuvring. The bench, in this regard, observed:
"Day in and day out, we are witnessing the sorry state of affairs in which the private witnesses turn hostile for obvious reasons. This Court has already expressed its views on the need for a legislative remedy to curtail such menace. Notwithstanding the above stated directions issued by this court in Vinod Kumar (supra), we take judicial note of the factual scenario that the trial courts are adjourning the cross examination of the private witnesses after the conclusion of the cross examination without any rhyme or reason, at the drop of a hat. Long adjournments are being given after the completion of the chief examination, which only helps the defense to win them over at times, with the passage of time. Thus, we deem it appropriate to reiterate that the trial courts shall endeavor to complete the examination of the private witnesses both chief and cross on the same day as far as possible. To further curtail this menace, we would expect the trial courts to take up the examination of the private witnesses first, before proceeding with that of the official witnesses. A copy of this judgment shall be circulated to all the trial courts, to be facilitated through the respective High Courts."
The court noted that a witness may depose in favour of a party in whose favour it is meant to be giving through his chief examination, while later on change his view in favour of the opposite side. Similarly, there would be cases where a witness does not support the case of the party starting from chief examination itself.
"This classification has to be borne in mind by the Court. With respect to the first category, the Court is not denuded of its power to make an appropriate assessment of the evidence rendered by such a witness. Even a chief examination could be termed as evidence. Such evidence would become complete after the cross examination. Once evidence is completed, the said testimony as a whole is meant for the court to assess and appreciate qua a fact. Therefore, not only the specific part in which a witness has turned hostile but the circumstances under which it happened can also be considered, particularly in a situation where the chief examination was completed and there are circumstances indicating the reasons behind the subsequent statement, which could be deciphered by the court. It is well within the powers of the court to make an assessment, being a matter before it and come to the correct conclusion.", the bench added.

Punjab and Haryana High Court has recently dismissed a petition filed by a Lawyer seeking action against Prince Harry of the British royal family for allegedly breaking a promise for marriage. The petitioner also prayed that arrest warrants be issued against him so that no further delay occur in their marriage. 
The petitioner has produced some emails , according to her, between the petitioner and Prince Harry, in which the person, sending the email, has stated that he promise to marry soon.
On a Court query from the Court, whether the petitioner has ever travelled to United Kingdom, reply was in negative and the petitioner only stated that she had conversation through social media, where she has even sent messages to Prince Charles that his son Prince Harry is engaged with her.

 After hearing the petitioner in person, the Court found that the petition is nothing, but just a day-dreamer's fantasy about marrying Prince Harry
Dismissing the petition, Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan observed as follows;
"It is well known fact that fake IDs are created on various social media sites like Facebook, Twitter etc. and authenticity of such conversation cannot be relied upon by this Court. There is every possibility that so-called Prince Harry may be sitting in a Cyber Cafe of a village in Punjab, looking for greener pastures for himself".

Quoting political philosopher William Godwin, the Orissa High Court, while stressing that Justice is the sum of all moral duty, directed the State Government to pay ₹10 Lakh as compensation to a 20-year-old gang-rape victim who became pregnant due to the offence committed against her.
However, the Bench of Justice S.K. Panigrahi refused the permission sought by the victim to terminate her over 26-week pregnancy noting that the provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 do not permit the termination of pregnancy of the petitioner.
Facts of the case
Essentially, the Court was dealing with the plea of a gang-rape victim who is carrying over 26-week pregnancy, who was denied permission to abort her child by the court of S.D.J.M., Banki, on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction. Challengng the order, she moved to the High Court.
It was submitted by her counsel that being an unmarried young girl, she has not just suffered physically and mentally but has also been deprived of maintaining a dignified social life due to the commission of the said offence.
It was also argued that the petitioner has been pregnant for more than 4 months and feels morally insecure to step out of her house due to the horrendous social stigma attached to such a crime.
In pursuance of the order of the Court, the medical team of S.C.B. Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack submitted that it may be unsafe for getting the termination done at this stage (over 26-week pregnancy). 
In fact, the report stated that allowing the termination at this stage could endanger the mother's life or even lead to a substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function
[NOTE: As per the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021, which came into force with effect from 24th September 2021, the upper limit for medical termination of pregnancy has been raised to 24 weeks, from the earlier stipulation of 20 weeks, for certain categories of women which will be defined in the MTP Rules. These categories will include 'vulnerable women' including rape victims.
As per the Amendment, the opinion of one doctor will be required for termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks; and the opinion of two doctors will be required for termination of pregnancy of 20 to 24 weeks.] 
Court's observations
The Court, at the outset, observed that crime like rape affects the lives of victims and associated physical and emotional consequences.
"Rape is a crime not only against a woman but against humanity at large as it brings out the most brutal, depraved and hideous aspects of human nature. It leaves a scar on the psyche of the victim and an adverse impact on society," the Court remarked
Further, taking into account the scheme of the MTP Act, the Court noted that in the instant case there is no medical opinion that termination of pregnancy is immediately necessary to save the life of the petitioner as per Section 5 of the MTP Act. 
"Viewed from every angle, the provisions of the MTP Act do not permit the termination of pregnancy of the petitioner," the Court observed.
"There is no opinion of any registered medical practitioner that the continuance of pregnancy of the petitioner would involve a risk to her life or grave injury to her physical or mental health. Further, there is no suggestion that if the child were born, it would suffer from any physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped." the Court added indicating that she can't be permitted to terminate her pregnancy.
Further, observing that she is being forced to bear and care for the unwanted child is bound to severely impact her personality and womanhood, the Court opined that her request should have been acceded to over and above the right to life of the child yet to be born.
Against this backdrop, the Court did add that such an issue is still crying for an unperplexed solution by way of suitable amendment in the statute governing the field.
Additionally, stressing that the ordeal of mental agony and fear of social ostracism can take a toll on the victim and even on the unborn child, the Court ruled that in the instant case, there is no other legal option for her but to undergo suffering and deliver the baby since the pregnancy is over twenty-six weeks old.
Lastly, ordering 10 lakh compensation, the Court also directed the District Collector, Cuttack to ensure that arrangements are made to provide proper diet, medical supervision and medicines as may be necessary, to the victim throughout the remaining part of her journey of pregnancy.
When the time for delivery arrives, proper medical facilities be made available for safe delivery of the child, the Court issued the direction.
Case title - 'X' v. State of Odisha & Ors
Read order

The Supreme Court held that a female member of the scheduled tribe is not entitled to any right of survivorship under the provisions of Hindu Succession Act.
The bench of Justices MR Shah and Krishna Murari urged the Central Government to consider whether it is necessary to bring a suitable amendment to Hindu Succession Act in this regard.
"To deny the equal right to the daughter belonging to the tribal even after a period of 70 years of the Constitution of India under which right to equality is guaranteed, it is high time for the Central Government to look into the matter and if required, to amend the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act by which the Hindu Succession Act is not made applicable to the members of the Scheduled Tribe." the bench said.
Section 2(2) Hindu Succession Act
The Section 2(2) reads thus : Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the members of any Scheduled Tribe within the meaning of clause (25) of Article 366 of the Constitution unless the Central Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, otherwise directs.
Background
In this case, Land Acquisition Reference Court rejected the claim of the share of a woman in the compensation, mainly on the ground that as the parties belong to Scheduled Tribe Community, the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act shall not be applicable and therefore she being a daughter shall not be entitled to the share in the amount of compensation. This view was upheld by the Orissa High Court.
On Madhu Kishwar judgment
Before the Apex Court, the appellant relied on the case of Madhu Kishwar & Ors. Versus State of Bihar & Ors., (1996) 5 SCC 125 to contend that she being a daughter shall be entitled to the share in the amount of compensation even applying the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act.
The court ntoed that in the case of Madhu Kishwar (supra), the Court had refused to strike down the provisions of Chota Nagpur Tenancy Act, 1908 which provided the succession to property in the male line of heirs and denying the right to Succession to the daughter, on the touchstone of Article 14.
"Under the circumstances in view of Section 2(2) of Hindu Succession Act and the appellant being the member of the Scheduled Tribe and as the female member of the Scheduled Tribe is specifically excluded, the appellant is not entitled to any right of survivorship under the provisions of Hindu Succession Act. No error has been committed by the High Court. The appeal therefore deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed."
Female tribal is entitled to parity with male tribal in intestate succession
While parting with the judgment, the court added that there may not be any justification to deny the right of survivorship so far as the female member of the Tribal is concerned.
When the daughter belonging to the non­tribal is entitled to the equal share in the property of the father, there is no reason to deny such right to the daughter of the Tribal community. Female tribal is entitled to parity with male tribal in intestate succession. To deny the equal right to the daughter belonging to the tribal even after a period of 70 years of the Constitution of India under which right to equality is guaranteed, it is high time for the Central Government to look into the matter and if required, to amend the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act by which the Hindu Succession Act is not made applicable to the members of the Scheduled Tribe..Therefore, though we dismiss the present appeal, it is directed to examine the question by the Central Government to consider it just and necessary to withdraw the exemptions provided under the Hindu 12 Succession Act in so far as the applicability of the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act to the Scheduled Tribes and whether to bring a suitable amendment or not. We hope and trust that the Central Government will look into the matter and take an appropriate decision taking into consideration the right to equality guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.

 A Letter of Intent is not a binding contract unless such an intention is evident from its terms, the Supreme Court observed while dismissing an appeal filed by South Eastern Coalfields Ltd, a Government company.
The bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta observed that such intention must be clear and unambiguous as LoI normally indicates a party's intention to enter into a contract with the other party in future.
The case arises out of a Letter of Intent issued by the company to the respondent firm while awarding the contract for a total work of Rs.387.40 lakhs. The firm filed writ petition before the High Court seeking quashing of the termination letter and the recovery order issued to them. The High Court held that there was no valid contract inter se the parties as it was subject to completion of certain formalities by the respondent, which were never completed, i.e. furnishing of the performance security; and the consequence was that the appellant was within their rights to cancel the award of work and forfeit the bid security. Thus, only the forfeiture of bid security was upheld while the endeavour of the appellants to recover the additional amount in award of contract to another contractor as compared to the respondent was held not recoverable, it was held.
Upholding the High Court judgment, the Apex court bench observed that no concluded contract had been arrived at inter se the parties. Mobilization at site by the  would not amount to a concluding contract inter se the parties, the bench added.
"The judicial views before us leave little doubt over the proposition that an LoI merely indicates a party's intention to enter into a contract with the other party in future. No binding relationship between the parties at this stage emerges and the totality of the circumstances have to be considered in each case. It is no doubt possible to construe a letter of intent as a binding contract if such an intention is evident from its terms. But then the intention to do so must be clear and unambiguous as it takes a deviation from how normally a letter of intent has to be understood. ", the bench observed.
All it can do is to forfeit the bid security amount , the Court said while dismissing the appeal. 
 

The Karnataka High Court has directed the Director General and Inspector General of Police to hold a departmental enquiry against police inspector Praveen K.Y of the Cottonpet Police station, for failure to comply with the order passed by the Magistrate court directing registration of First Information Report on a private complaint of theft.
 Justice M Nagaprasanna said lawful orders passed by the judicial authority are required to be scrupulously enforced by the police and failure to do so constitutes a constitutional tort arising out of breach of a fundamental right of access to justice for victims of crime. "Such breach amounts to serious misconduct and gross dereliction of duty justifying imposition of major penalty. Such gross dereliction of official duty by the Law Enforcement Agencies cannot be countenanced," the court said.
 The direction was given in the judgment on a petition filed by one M Prakash who had approached the court seeking appointment of any other police officer to investigate the complaint filed by him under sections 380, 503, 410, 414, 425, 442, 451 read with Section 34 of the IPC.
 As per the private complaint, the accused in the morning hours of 26-03-2021 forcibly broke open the doors of residence of the petitioner, stole many articles in the house. The complainant and the accused are stated to be fighting a dispute over family properties.
 The magistrate court vide its order dated 29-04-2022 directed registration of the complaint by the Cottonpet Police Station for investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C and also directed the matter be listed on 26-07-2022.
 Though the Cottonpet Police received the certified copy of the order on 04.05.2022, the crime was not registered. On 26-07-2022, when the matter was posted before the court, a reminder was also sent to the Police Station for registration of the crime and reporting such registration. Even then the crime was not registered. Finally, the case was registered only on 18.10.2022 after about 5½ months of reference being made by the Magistrate.
 The police defended the delay by saying that the reference though was received on 04-05-2022, the file was misplaced from the table of the Inspector and the moment the file was traced, the case was immediately registered. It was submitted that the Inspector of Police, who had mishandled the file, had been placed under suspension and the present incumbent has filed an affidavit that such instances would not be repeated.
 Findings
 The court said the Magistrate had directed investigation to be conducted on the complaint of the petitioner under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C, which was received by the Cottonpet Police on 04-05-2022.
 “Law requires that, when the Magistrate directs investigation to be conducted under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C., the investigation has to commence immediately and for the investigation to commence, a FIR should be registered without any loss of time,” it observed.
 Noting that the case was registered 5 months and 21 days after the direction by Magistrate, the bench said there has been blatant callousness on the part of the Station House Officer of Cottonpet Police Station, who has displayed "lackadaisical attitude" towards registration of the crime.
The court refused to accept the justification for delay offered by the police that, upon enquiry, it was noticed that the order of the Magistrate had been misplaced, and while taking out some other file, the present officer i.e., the Inspector holding the post of PSI found the order of reference and registered the crime immediately.
 “Registration of an FIR on a cognizable offence, more particularly, on a reference being made by the learned Magistrate under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. is imperative and of paramount importance, as the investigation has to commence on such registration," said the court.
It added that the action of registration of crime with an inordinate delay "would disclose culpable negligence on the part of the Law Enforcement Agency in compliance with the lawful order passed by the learned Magistrate under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. for registration of FIR and for investigation into cognizable offences.”
 “The failure to register the crime by the then Officer in-charge of the Cottonpet Police Station cannot be brushed aside, as a mere loss of file and tracing of it. The said officer cannot and should not be left off the hook, more so, in the light of the affidavit admitting such dereliction of duty filed by the State," it said.
 The court disposed of the petition after the police informed the court that the final report has been filed in the case but called for a compliance report of action on the departmental enquiry.

In a bail hearing before the Allahabad High Court, it was revealed that the advocates appearing on behalf of the accused and the complainant were acting in collusion, wherein the counsel for the complainant had filed forged vakalatnama at the directions of the counsel for the accused.The counsel for the accused had 'arranged' a forged vakalatnama and engaged a lawyer to represent the accused to record no-objection to grant bail.
Justice Sanjay Kumar Singh noted that the said action by long-standing counsels is highly deplorable, attacking the sanctity of the profession and the institution. As a remedial measure, the Court noted that a self-attested copy of any identity proof (preferably Aadhar Card) mentioning the person's mobile number should also be filed along with the Vakalatnama.
After advancing the contentions on behalf of the accused, Advocate Ram Ker Singh told the Court that the complainant has no objection to granting of the sought bail. Mr. Hausila Prasad, purportedly representing the complainant, concurred that there is no opposition to the grant of bail.
Advocate Vivek Kumar Singh, who was instructed by the complainant, then intervened to make a preliminary objection, apprising the Court that Advocate Hausala Prasad has filed forged Vakalatnama and that the informant has not engaged him. Informing that the said Vakalatnama is a forged document, he argued that Advocate Prasad filed his Vakalatnama on July 26, 2021, through e-mode in collaboration with Mr. Ram Ker Singh, learned counsel for the applicant to obtain bail by hook or crook.
When the Court confronted Advocate Prasad, he stated that the said Vakalatnama was provided to him by Mr. Ram Ker Singh,  counsel for the applicant. He further submitted that he is associated with the counsel appearing for the applicant, and his fee to appear is also being provided by Mr. Singh. It was admitted that he was engaged in this manner so that the Court does not issue notices to the informant as the present matter pertains to Section 376(2)(i), 506 IPC, and 3/4 Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
The Court noted that it is ostensibly clear that forged Vakalatnama has been filed on behalf of the informant/complainant to obtain bail surreptitiously.
Mr. Prasad tendered his unconditional apology by stating that he will take care of such things and will not repeat such mistakes in the future and also stated that he wants to withdraw his Vakalatnama above. In contrast, Mr. Ram Ker Singh, learned counsel for the applicant, did not tender his apology and stated that it is common practice at the High Court.
The Court expressed shock at the statement of Mr. Singh, noting that it is 'painful to the conscious,' which creates a stir compelling one to ponder over the matter. Condemning the said move, the Court noted that such an action by the advocates having a long-standing experience of the practice is highly deplorable, referring it to as an effort to tarnish the image of the noble profession of advocacy.
The Court further noted that it is very painful to see the downfall in the moral values of the noble profession of advocacy.
It remarked that professional ethics are a fundamental requirement in the legal field because it is an important tool that establishes the rule of law and keeps the legal profession and the legal institutions on a high pedestal. Emphasizing the sanctity of faith between the Bar and the Bench, the Court noted that ethics are an important factor, which contains discipline, fairness, trust, moral values, help to colleagues, respect and responsibilities, etc. The Court noted,
"It creates confidence between the Bar and the Bench. Lawyers play a crucial role in the justice delivery system. In my view, professional ethics are the backbone of the legal profession, which is a self-regulating profession. It is the moral duty of the Bar and the Bench both to maintain the sanctity of legal profession and the institution."
Noting that Vakalatnama must be beyond the shadow of any doubt, the Court noted that it is a valuable document in the legal profession, which empowers a lawyer to act for or on behalf of his client, sometimes conferring wide authority/power upon a lawyer. 
As Advocate Prasad realized his mistake and accepted his guilt before the Court, no action was taken against him on his request. He was permitted to move an appropriate application to withdraw his Vakalatnama from this case. However, Advocate Singh, who provided forged Vakalatnama of the informant and provided fee for Advocate Prasad, neither tendered an oral apology nor did he feel regret on his conduct. 
Noting that the Court cannot act as a silent spectator, the matter was referred to the Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh for taking appropriate action/decision in the matter. 
The Court also noted that the issue of filing a forged Vakalatnama of any person in a Court proceeding is a serious issue, as it is likely to affect the valuable legal right and interest of the persons/litigants concerned, ergo keeping in view, the larger interest of the litigants/victims, complainants or aggrieved persons especially in criminal matters and members of the Bar, who believe in professional ethics. The Court remarked that it is 'high time to adopt some remedial measures, so the litigants or aggrieved persons are not deprived of their legal rights.
Following this observation, the Court proposed that along with Vakalatnama, a self-attested copy of any identity proof (preferably Aadhar Card) mentioning the person's mobile number should also be filed, or any other method may be adopted in the interest of litigants and the institution.

"(Circumstantial) evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence," the Allahabad High Court reiterated recently.The observation was made by a division bench of Justice Vivek Kumar Birla and Justice Subhash Vidhyarthi while dismissing an appeal filed by the victim against the order of Additional Sessions Judge, Badaun,...
"(Circumstantial) evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence," the Allahabad High Court reiterated recently.
The observation was made by a division bench of Justice Vivek Kumar Birla and Justice Subhash Vidhyarthi while dismissing an appeal filed by the victim against the order of Additional Sessions Judge, Badaun, acquitting the respondent of charges under Sections 302, 34 IPC.
Noting that the case is based on circumstantial evidence and the "chain of circumstances" sought to be established by the prosecution was not so complete so as to arrive at the conclusion of guilt, the High Court found no ground for interference. It observed,
"In case of circumstantial evidence, the circumstances, taken cumulatively, should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and none else and the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of 8 the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence."
In the instant case, the deceased was found in a field by his brother, PW-1. The incident was reported to the police station and FIR was lodged against the unknown individuals. Later on, the alleged weapon used in the incident was recovered on pointing out of Narendra Singh (one of the accused). 
Sine the Additional Sessions Court acquitted the accused, the present appeal was filed by the appellant seeking to set aside the impunged judgement and convict the accused person as liable in the instant case.
 The counsel for the appellant submitted that when the PW-1 went out in search of the deceased he had seen the accused persons coming from the side of the spot, where the dead body was found and this clearly connects the accused persons with the offence. The counsel also submitted that even the weapon used in the incident was recovered on pointing out of Narendra Singh and hence prayed to set aside the impugned judgement and convict the accused person as liable in the instant case.
 Findings
 At the outset, the Court noted that it is not even a case of last seen evidence. P.W.-1, brother of the deceased, has stated only this much that the dead body was found in a field and he had seen the accused persons coming from the side of the dead body.
So far as recovery of weapon is concerned, it was recovered after more than two months. Further, as per FSL report, the bloodstained on the weapon (darati) were disintegrated and therefore, were not sufficient to record any finding. Furthermore, the doctor who conducted the postmortem of the deceased stated that the nature of injuries could not have been caused by darati and it could have been caused only by sharp edged weapon only. 
In this backdrop, the Court was of the opinion that the chain of circumstantial evidence is not complete.
Court further found that the motive attributed is extremely weak, which is stated to be of the year 2003, whereas the incident is of the year 2011, that too in relation to daughter of the informant and niece of the deceased.
For this purpose, it relied upon the supreme Court judgement namely AnwarAli and another vs. State of Himachal Pradesh, where it was held that absence of motive in a case depending on circumstantial evidence is a factor that weighs in favour of the accused.
 "It is also required to be noted and it is not in dispute that this is a case of circumstantial evidence. As held by this Court in catena of decisions that in case of a circumstantial evidence, the circumstances, taken cumulatively, should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and none else and the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence."
 The court also relied on the Supreme Court judgement namely  Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra [(1984) 4 SCC 116] where it was held that while dealing with circumstantial evidence, the onus was on the prosecution to prove that the chain is complete and the infirmity or lacuna in prosecution cannot be cured by false defence or plea. The conditions precedent before conviction could be based on circumstantial evidence, must be fully established.
 On aspect of Circumstantial evidence, it held
 "in such circumstances, are of the opinion that it is a case of circumstantial evidence, where the chain of circumstances were not so complete so as to arrived at the conclusion that the accused persons have committed the offence by using the weapon allegedly recovered."
 In view of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the court held that the trial court has taken a possible view of the matter on appreciation of the evidence and the bench does not find that it is a fit case for interference in the judgment of the trial court.
 And hence, the appeal was accordingly dismissed.
Case Title : Shriniwas vs State Of U.P. And Others

"It is deplorable that the representative of the public compel the public servant to pass illegal orders and the public servant comply their illegal dictates without any demur," observed the Allahabad High Court recently in one of its orders.
The Bench of Justice Siddharth made this stern remark while allowing a plea filed by one Basrat Ullah challenging an order passed by Special Secretary, UP Govt removing him as the Principal of Madarsa Darul Uloom Ahle Sunnat Badrool Uloom at District Basti.
It was his case that in the year 2019, he was appointed to the post of Principal in the said madrasa and prior to his appointment, he had worked as an assistant teacher at the Darul Uloom Ahle Sunnat Madrasa in Gonda for five years. Based on his experience, he was appointed to the post of Principal.
He joined his duties in October 2019, however, a complaint was made against his appointment and the State Government directed inquiry into the allegations which led to passing of an order dated 23.07.2020. 
Now, a local Member of Legislative Assembly sent a letter to the Chief Minister of the State alleging that the conditional order of approval of appointment of the petitioner dated 23.07.2020 was against the Rules and should be cancelled. 
Pursuant to this, the Special Secretary, UP Govt cancelled the approved appointment of the petitioner.
It was his contention before the Court that his appointment was cancelled without holding inquiry and proving the allegations against the petitioner before the inquiry officer by leading reliable evidence. It was submitted that the impugned orders are absolutely arbitrarily and have been passed on the dictate of Member of Legislative Assembly.
Against this backdrop, after hearing the rival contentions, the Court noted that only the complaint made by Sanjay Pratap Jaiswal, local MLA and Swami Prasad Maurya, Minister of Labour and employment U.P. was considered by the special secretary and thereafter a decision was taken to cancel the approval of appointment of the petitioner.
"It is deplorable that the representative of the public compel the public servant to pass illegal orders and the public servant comply their illegal dictates without any demur. The illegality in the conduct of the respondents is apparent from the material on record. The impugned orders have been passed in gross violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and are hereby quashed," the Court remarked as it directed that the petitioner be reinstated in service forthwith and his arrears of salary be paid to him within six weeks.
Case title - Basharat Ullah v. State Of U.P. And 6 Others [WRIT - A No. - 1959 of 2022]

The Kerala High Court recently ruled that the intention of the parties is a key factor in determining if a transaction was benami or not, which could be ascertained from the tests laid down by the Apex Court for this purpose.
A Division Bench of Justice A. Muhamed Mustaque and Justice Sophy Thomas also laid down that as long as there is no evidence to the contrary, when a husband purchases property joining his wife as a name lender, he is still the beneficiary of such property, but if it was purchased in her favour, then she would be the beneficiary. 
"When husband purchases property as part of his real estate business joining his wife as a name lender in the title document, even availing bank loans in her name to pay the consideration, it cannot be said that the purchase was for the benefit of the wife, when there is clear evidence to prove the benami nature of the transaction. But when there is evidence to show that the husband purchased the property or executed document in favour of his wife, unless the contrary is proved, it will be treated as the property of the wife purchased for her benefit.""The intention of the parties is a key factor in determining the nature of the transaction, which could be gathered from the relationship between parties, their conduct previous and subsequent to the transaction, source of money for purchase, possession of the property, possession of the title documents, repayment of loan, etc. etc."
The case has peculiar facts where a man had an illicit relation with his employee and had a child with her. Later, he brought the child home to his wife under the guise that the child was abandoned by an unwed nurse and up for adoption. Since the couple had not been successful in having kids despite years of treatment, the wife agreed and raised the child for five years as their own, now realising that her husband was his biological father. 
However, upon coming to know of the affair, the anguished wife returned to her home. Since the husband refused to give up his relationship with the employee, the wife filed for divorce. 
The couple had lived together for more than 16 years doing various businesses and acquiring a lot of properties in their name jointly and severally. Both the parties filed for a declaration that they were the beneficial owner and the opposite party was only a name lender in the property transactions and claimed injunction against each other. 
The Family Court dissolved their marriage, dismissed the husband's plea for declaration as the beneficial owner and allowed in part the wife's plea for the same. Challenging this order, the husband filed an appeal before the High Court. 
Senior Advocate S. Sreekumar appeared for the husband and Advocate G.S. Reghunath for the wife in the matter. 
The Court initially analysed the meaning of 'benami' before concluding that a Benami transaction means the transfer by/to a person who only acts as an ostensible owner in place of the real owner, whose name is not disclosed. The Bench also established that the question of whether a transaction was real or benami depends upon the intention of the beneficiary. 
It was also recalled that the Supreme Court in Java Dayal Peddar vs. Bibi Hazra (AIR 1974 Supreme Court 171) had laid down 6 tests to determine if a transaction is benami or not. 
Further, it was noted that the transactions in this case spanned from 1998 to 2005, which implies that the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 is applicable here. 
As per Section 2(a) of the Act, a 'benami transaction' is any transaction in which property is transferred to one person for a consideration paid or provided by another person. Section 3(2)(a) stipulates that nothing prevents a person from purchasing property in the name of his wife/unmarried daughter, and unless the contrary is proved, it is presumed that the said property has been purchased for the benefit of the wife/unmarried daughter.
Therefore, to find out if the transaction alleged is a benami and to ascertain who was the benamidar and the beneficiary, the Bench applied the six tests in each transaction.
"If it is found that the person in whose name the property stands was only a name lender, and the property was actually purchased for the benefit of the beneficial owner, expending his own money, then of course, the benamidar may not get any right, title or interest over the properties held in his/her name."
The Court accordingly decided the nature of each transaction and disposed of the plea. 
Case Title: C.C Joy v. C.D Mini & Anr.

The Supreme Court held that the trial of the scheduled offence should take place in the Special Court which has taken cognizance of the offence of money-laundering.
The court also added that the provisions of the Cr.P.C. are applicable to all proceedings under the PMLA Act including proceedings before the Special Court, except to the extent they are specifically excluded.
The bench of Justices V. Ramasubramanian and J.B. Pardiwala observed thus while dismissing the writ petition filed by journalist Rana Ayyub challenging the jurisdiction of a special court in Ghaziabad under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 to take cognisance of the complaint filed by the Enforcement Directorate against her for alleged violations in amounts collected through crowdfunding for COVID relief.
The contention raised on behalf of Rana Ayyub was that under Section 44(1) of the PMLA, an offence punishable under the Act, shall be triable only by the Special Court constituted for the area in which the offence has been committed and therefore the Special Court in Maharashtra alone could have taken cognizance of the complaint. So the issues considered was (i) whether the trial of the offence of money-laundering should follow the trial of the scheduled/predicate offence or vice versa; and (ii) whether the Court of the Special Judge, Anti-Corruption, CBI Court No.1, Ghaziabad, can be said to have exercised extra-territorial jurisdiction, even though the offence alleged, was not committed within the jurisdiction of the said Court.
Taking note of the provisions of Section 43 and 44 of the PMLA, the bench noted that (i) that the offence punishable under the PMLA as well as a scheduled offence connected to the same shall be triable by the Special Court constituted for the area in which the offence of money-laundering has been committed; and (ii) that if cognizance has been taken by one Court, in respect of the scheduled offence and cognizance has been taken in respect of the offence of money-laundering by the Special Court, the Court trying the scheduled offence shall commit it to the Special Court trying the offence of moneylaundering.
"It is clear that the trial of the scheduled offence should take place in the Special Court which has taken cognizance of the offence of money-laundering. In other words, the trial of the scheduled offence, insofar as the question of territorial jurisdiction is concerned, should follow the trial of the offence of money-laundering and not vice versa...In view of the specific mandate of clauses (a) and (c) of subsection (1) of Section 44, it is the Special Court constituted under the PMLA that would have jurisdiction to try even the scheduled offence. Even if the scheduled offence is taken cognizance of by any other Court, that Court shall commit the same, on an application by the concerned authority, to the Special Court which has taken cognizance of the offence of money-laundering.", the court observed.
Regarding the second issue, the bench observeed that the issue of territorial jurisdiction cannot be decided in a writ petition, especially when there is a serious factual dispute about the place/places of commission of the offence. This question should be raised by the petitioner before the Special Court, since an answer to the same would depend upon evidence as to the places where any one or more of the processes or activities mentioned in Section 3 were carried out, the court said.

The Supreme Court on Thursday affirmed the death penalty awarded to Lakshar-e-Toiba militant Mohammed Arif for the 2000 Red Fort Attack case which resulted in the death of three persons including two army officers. The Court dismissed the review petition filed by him challenging his conviction and sentence.
When there is challenge to the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India by acts of terrorism, such acts are taken as the most aggravating circumstances, the bench comprising Chief Justice UU Lalit, Justice S Ravindra Bhat and Justice Bela M Trivedi observed. The court added that this factor completely outweigh the factors which may even remotely be brought into consideration as mitigating circumstances on record.
Background
On 22.12.2000 some intruders started indiscriminate firing and gunned down three persons including two army Jawans belonging to 7th Rajputana Rifles. Mohd. Arif, admittedly a Pakistani national, was arrested on December 25, 2000 in this case. He was convicted by the trial court on October 24, 2005, and awarded death sentence on October 31, 2005. His death sentence was confirmed by the Delhi High Court by an order dated September 13, 2007.
The apex court dismissed his appeal challenging the conviction on August 10, 2011, and his review petition was dismissed on August 28, 2011. Upholding the High Court's confirmation of Death Sentence Supreme Court by its earlier order had observed– "It was an attack on Mother India. This is apart from the fact that as many as three persons had lost their lives. The conspirators had no place in India. Appellant was a foreign national and had entered India without any authorization or even justification. This is apart from the fact that the appellant built up a conspiracy by practicing deceit and committing various other offences in furtherance of the conspiracy to wage war against India as also to commit murders by launching an unprovoked attack on the soldiers of Indian Army. We, therefore, have no doubts that death sentence was the only sentence in the peculiar circumstance of this case."
However, in 2016, the Supreme Court decided to re-hear his review petition based after the verdict which held that review petitions filed in death sentence cases must be heard in open court. The apex court on April 28, 2014 had stayed Arif's execution in the case.
Grounds in Review Petition
The following grounds were raised in the review petition:
(a) The concerned Courts committed error in allowing call records to be admitted in evidence, in the absence of an appropriate certificate under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
(b) The disclosure statements of the review petitioner must be taken to be inadmissible on account of illtreatment meted out to him during the intervening night between his actual arrest and his formal arrest. 
(c) The recovery of ammunition or the encounter of one Abu Shamal, who was stated to be the accomplice of the petitioner, at Batla House, New Delhi, could not be associated with the disclosure statement of the review petitioner. 
(d) Any possibility of retribution and rehabilitation of the review petitioner, or that he would continue to be a threat to the society, was not considered by the Courts.
 Anvar P.V. as clarified in Arjun Panditrao is the law declared on Section 65B of the Evidence Act
The bench observed that the decision in Anvar P.V. as clarified in Arjun Panditrao is the law declared on Section 65B of the Evidence Act. In Anvar, it was held that in the case of CD, VCD, chip, etc., the same shall be accompanied by the certificate in terms of Section 65-B obtained at the time of taking the document, without which, the secondary evidence pertaining to that electronic record, is inadmissible. Approving this view, the court in Arjun Panditrao clarified that certificate under Section 65-B(4) is unnecessary if the original document itself is produced. The court therefore observed:
Consequently, we must eschew, for the present purposes, the electronic evidence in the form of CDRs which was without any appropriate certificate under Section 65-B(4) of the Evidence Act...even after eschewing circumstances 'h' and 'j' which were directly attributable to the CDRs relied upon by the prosecution, the other circumstances on record do clearly spell out and prove beyond any doubt the involvement of the review petitioner in the crime in question
Direct attack on the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India
One of the grounds taken in the review petition was that the possibility of retribution and rehabilitation of the convict, or that he would continue to be a threat to the society, was not considered by the Courts while awarding/confirming the death sentence. The Centre submitted that the cases involving acts of terror which challenge the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India can only be adequately compensated by awarding the death sentence.
"There is nothing on record which can be taken to be a mitigating circumstance in favour of the review petitioner. The suggestion that there is a possibility of retribution and rehabilitation, is not made out from and supported by any material on record. On the other hand, the aggravating circumstances evident from the record and specially the fact that there was a direct attack on the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India, completely outweigh the factors which may even remotely be brought into consideration as mitigating circumstances on record.", the court observed.

The statement by a co-accused under Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act can be treated as a clue or piece of information for initiating and conducting investigation to find out whether there is any independent and satisfactory material for further investigation, the Gujarat Court has clarified. 
The Bench comprising Justice Vipul Pancholi made this observation while hearing an application under Section 482 of CrPC seeking the quashment of the FIR for charges under sections 65(e), 116B, 81 and 98(2) of the Gujarat Prohibition Act and under sections 465, 468 and 471 of IPC.
"So far as the present applicant is concerned, till date the investigation is not over and, therefore, it is always open for the investigating agency to consider the statement of the co-accused for the purpose of further investigation," it said.
 Background
 The Applicant herein contested that he had been implicated in the FIR on the basis of a statement made by the co-accused, even though there was no material against him connecting him with the incident. 
 The Respondent, per contra, averred that the statement of the co-accused can be considered during the course of investigation as a clue for further investigation. Therefore, the FIR cannot be quashed. The Gujarat High Court in a previous decision had affirmed this view.
 Judgement
 Justice Pancholi noted that primarily the Applicant had filed the application on the ground that he had been falsely implicated based on the statement of the co-accused only. However, till the time investigation was not over, it is always open for the investigation agency to consider the statement of the co-accused for the purpose of further investigation.
 The Bench relied on Mohmed Salim abdul Rasid Shaikh v. State of Gujarat 2001(2) GLR 1580, where it was held:
 "…Irrespective of the fact that statement of co-accused to police is not admissible in evidence before the Court, but police can certainly consider that statement as a clue while interrogating him further or other persons arrested or interrogated during the course of investigation..."
 Further, in Further, in Dolatram Tekchand Harjani v.State of Gujarat 2013 (3) GLR 2133, the Gujarat HC had opined:
 "The said submission gives rise to an issue viz. does it mean that on the basis of a statement of co-accused even investigation cannot be initiated. On this count, it comes out that while raising the said contention, it is conveniently overlooked that such position or preposition does not mean that statement by a co-accused cannot act as or cannot be even treated as a piece of information or a clue to initiate and conduct inquiry/investigation so as to find out whether there is any independent, cogent, reliable and satisfactory material/evidence which may support, justify and provide cause for further investigation or a charge-sheet and a trial."
 Justice Pancholi while affirming this view of the Gujarat High Court stated that when the investigation has commenced or the process is going on, it would not be proper and just to terminate or direct the investigation officer to close the investigation. To bolster this view, the Bench referred to the Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan Alias Pappu Yadav judgement where the Supreme Court had opined:
 "The admissibility or otherwise of the confessional statement and the effect of the evidence already adduced by the prosecution and the merit of the evidence that may be adduced hereinafter including that of the witnesses sought to be recalled are all matters to be considered at the stage of the trial."
 Thus, per the Bench, the admissibility or otherwise of the confessional statement can be examined at the stage of the trial and not at the stage of investigation. Section 25 of the Evidence Act could not come to play at this juncture. 
Accordingly, the Bench dismissed the application but granted the liberty to file fresh application before the Court after the filing of the chargesheet if there was no material against the Applicant.

The Supreme Court reiterated that the scope of judicial review on the quantum of punishment imposed in disciplinary proceedings is limited.
"Even in cases where the punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority is found to be shocking to the conscience of the Court, normally the disciplinary authority or the appellate authority should be directed to reconsider the question of imposition of penalty", the bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S. Oka  observed.
The court added that it is only in rare and exceptional cases where the court might to shorten the litigation may think of substituting its own view as to the quantum of punishment in place of punishment awarded by the competent authority that too after assigning cogent reasons(Case :Union of India vs. Ex Constable Ram Karan)
.In this case, disciplinary proceedings were initiated against a CRPF constable and the competent authority imposed a punishment of removal from service. Allowing the writ petition filed by the constable, the High Court observed that the punishment of removal from service is disproportionate to the proved misconduct. The court then substituted the punishment to his confinement from 1.00 p.m. to 10.00 p.m. in quarter guard jail as the adequate punishment with a further direction for his reinstatement
The Apex court, in the appeal filed by Union of India, noted that the nature of allegations against the constable are grave in nature as he not only threatened the Doctor- complainant but  misbehaved and abused and injured him and made false allegations against him of sexual harassment to his wife. The court said that it is the disciplinary authority, or the appellate authority in appeal, which is to decide the nature of punishment to be given to the delinquent employee. In this context, it observed:
23. Even in cases where the punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority is found to be shocking to the conscience of the Court, normally the disciplinary authority or the appellate authority should be directed to reconsider the question of imposition of penalty. The scope of judicial review on the quantum of punishment is available but with a limited scope. It is only when the penalty imposed appears to be shockingly disproportionate to the nature of misconduct that the Courts would frown upon. Even in such a case, after setting aside the penalty order, it is to be left to the disciplinary/appellate authority to take a call and it is not for the Court to substitute its decision by prescribing the quantum of punishment. However, it is only in rare and exceptional cases where the court might to shorten the litigation may think of substituting its own view as to the quantum of punishment in place of punishment awarded by the competent authority that too after assigning cogent reasons.
The court also noticed the principles set out in Lucknow Kshetriya Gramin Bank (Now Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh Gramin Bank) and Another vs. Rajendra Singh in this regard:
When charge(s) of misconduct is proved in an enquiry the quantum of punishment to be imposed in a particular case is essentially the domain of the departmental authorities.The courts cannot assume the function of disciplinary/departmental authorities and to decide the quantum of punishment and nature of penalty to be awarded, as this function is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the competent authority.  Limited judicial review is available to interfere with the punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority, only in cases where such penalty is found to be shocking to the conscience of the court Even in such a case when the punishment is set aside as shockingly disproportionate to the nature of charges framed against the delinquent employee, the appropriate course of action is to remit the matter back to the disciplinary authority or the appellate authority with direction to pass appropriate order of penalty. The court by itself cannot mandate as to what should be the penalty in such a case. The only exception to the principle stated in para 19.4 above, would be in those cases where the co-­delinquent is awarded lesser punishment by the disciplinary authority even when the charges of misconduct were identical or the co-­delinquent was foisted with more serious charges. This would be on the doctrine of equality when it is found that the employee concerned and the co­-delinquent are equally placed. However, there has to be a complete parity between the two, not only in respect of nature of charge but subsequent conduct as well after the service of charge­sheet in the two cases. If the co-­delinquent accepts the charges, indicating remorse with unqualified apology, lesser punishment to him would be justifiable."
Setting aside the High Court judgment, the court observed thus while allowing the appeal:
What punishment was required to be imposed, in the facts and circumstances of the case, was a matter which fell exclusively within the jurisdiction of the competent authority and the interference made by the High Court is in a cavalier manner while recording the finding of penalty to be disproportionate without taking into consideration the seriousness of the misconduct committed by the respondent which is unpardonable and not sustainable in law.

The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed pleas to postpone NEET-PG 2022 scheduled for May 21, saying postponement will create chaos and uncertainty and will impact patient care and will cause prejudice to over 2 lakh students who have prepared.
The bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant was considering a petition preferred by doctors seeking to postpone the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for Postgraduate (NEET-PG) 2022 exam scheduled on May 21 citing a clash with ongoing counselling for NEET PG 2021.
The bench observed in the order as follows :
"As regards to the submission that postponement will not cause prejudice, what must be borne in mind is that there are students who have registered. As the country gets back on the rails after the disruptions caused due to the pandemic, the time schedule must be adhered to. 
Any delay in conducting the exam will result in fewer number of resident doctors. This year only 2 sets of doctors are there. The request cannot be entertained due to the reason that it would have affect on the patient care and the career on the doctors.
These are matter which pertain to policy domain. Unless the Court is satisfied that the decision which has been taken by the authorities is without application of mind to relevant circumstances or was manifestly arbitrary, there would no reason for the Court to interfere. Needs of patient care & treatment must be paramount in the clash of the ones who have registered & those who have not registered".
The bench noted that nearly 2 lakh six thousand doctors have registered for the exam. "What must be borne in mind by the court is that there is a large body of students on the other hand and needs of patient care cannot be ignored...Over 2 lakh 6000 doctors have registered, and they will be put to prejudice if the exam is further postponed", the bench observed.
Senior Advocates Rakesh Khanna, Anand Grover and P Wilson appeared for the petitioners. Additional Solicitor General Aiswarya Bhati appeared for the Union Government.
The lawyers of the petitioners pointed out that the Counselling process for 2021 has been going on since May 21 in many states and the students, while running from "pillar to post" for the 2021 counselling, were not in a frame of mind to prepare for the 2022 exams. The petitioners argued that an extension of 4-8 weeks will cause no prejudice to anyone, and will in fact give more time to all students to prepare.
Senior Advocate P Wilson submitted that if the 2022 exams are held as per the proposed schedule, it will create a situation where 2021 and 2022 students are studying in the same year and the colleges do not have the infrastructure facilities to cater to both batches simultaneously.
ASG Bhati submitted that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had seriously deliberated on the issue and took a conscious decision on May 10 to not postpone the exams for reasons bearing on public interest and health care. She submitted that the postponement will have a "cascading effect" on future admissions and other courses. She also highlighted the issue of deficiency of fewer resident doctors in hospitals due to delay in completion of PG admissions. "Any delay would infract upon patient care, since this will lead to fewer number of resident doctors as they are supposed to be three batches of PGS doctors available in hospitals but as opposed to this only two batches are available due to delay", she said. The ASG further submitted that is is necessary to allow the schedule, which was disrupted due to pandemic, to be put back on track.
It was argued in the petition that NEET-PG 2022 aspirants/ candidates should not be made to suffer and be given a fair opportunity of participating in the NEET PG Examination 2022 when the counselling of last year's NEET PG 2021 is still undergoing and likely to be over by 9.5.2022, if not extended or faulted with, for no fault of theirs. 
"Some of the petitioners and aspirants are the candidates who have appeared in NET PG 2021 and are participants in the ongoing counselling process which is unlikely to get concluded by 9.5.2022 considering the roller-coaster ride which they have been subjected to since July 2021. The petitioners and other thousands of aspirants are becoming the victim of the system and are made to suffer for no fault of their own," the plea states. 
Doctors in the petition had further stated that the doctors cannot be deprived of even filling up of forms for NEET PG Examination 2022, as the last date for it was closed on 25.3.2022 and the petitioners being participants in AIQ Mop-up counselling did not fill form then in hope of getting a seat and now after the cancellation of AIQ Mop-up on 31.3.2022.
"Because of fault of the respondents, the petitioners are now not even allowed to fill forms for NEET PG Examination and thus the candidates neither got a seat in 2021 Examination counselling nor could register for NET PG 2022 Examination and would be wasting a full year without their fault," the petition further stated.
Along with seeking to quash the notification dated February 4, 2022 issued by NBE for holding NEET PG 2022, doctors in the plea have further sought for notification of a fresh date after 8 weeks so that the issue of the NEET PG 2021 counselling exam gets settled.
Relief has further been sought to permit the students to register themselves for NEET PG 2022 as they were participating in counselling for NEET PG 2021 and that the last date of form was March 25, 2022.
The petition was filed by Advocate Ashutosh Dubey and Abhishekh Chauhan.
NEET-PG 2021 was postponed many times due to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 PG exam, originally scheduled to be held in April 2021, was held only on September 11, 2021. The NEET-PG counselling got delayed due to a case pending in the Supreme Court challenging the implementation of EWS-OBC reservation in the All India Quota.
It was in the first week of January 2022 that the Supreme Court allowed the counseling process to start based on the existing criteria for EWS-OBC reservation in AIQ. There were several cases filed against the counseling process as well. On March 31, the Court cancelled the mop-up round counseling in view of anomalies in the addition of 146 additional seats and directed the holding of a special round for the newly added seats. Some petitions are pending in the High Courts as well, challenging the counselling process for State Quota.
In 2020, the Supreme Court dismissed a plea to postpone the NEET exam on the grounds of COVID-19.

Head Notes
Judicial Review - Plea to postpone NEET PG 2022 rejected - Unless the Court is satisfied that the decision which has been taken by the authorities is without application of mind to relevant circumstances or was manifestly arbitrary, there would no reason for the Court to interfere- Balancing of priorities in administration is a difficult task. The task is entrusted to the executive and not to courts-As the country gets back on the rails after the dislocation which was caused due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it is necessary that the decision which has been taken by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of adhering to the time schedule must be accepted(Para 12 and 13).

The Karnataka High Court has said that an insurance company is liable to pay compensation to a third party, even if the cheque issued towards premium by the insured was dishonoured, if such fact was not intimated to the policy holder before the occurrence of the motor accident.
 A single judge bench of Justice HP Sandesh while allowing the appeal preferred filed by a claimant against the order of Claims Tribunal which exonerated the Insurance company from liability, observed,
"the Tribunal while considering the issue of liability, only considered the bank's memo regarding the dishonour of cheque and comes to the conclusion that the Insurance Company has intimated about the dishonour of cheque as well as cancellation of policy to the owner of the offending vehicle but not discussed whether it was served or not and simply comes to the conclusion that the policy was not in force...No material before the Court that they have intimated the same to the insured."
The insurance company had submitted that where the remittance made by the policyholder is not realised by the insurer, the policy shall be treated as void ab-initio.
 However, the bench noted that the Company had not produced acknowledgment receipt regarding intimation sent to the insured nor it was their claim that the insured was personally informed.
 The bench further cited public interest element in such cases, stating: "The public interest that a policy of insurance serves must, clearly, prevail..." Reliance was placed on Oriental Insurance Co. v. Inderjit Kaur & Ors., where it was held that even if Insurer was entitled to avoid the policy for not having received the premium, it is liable for third party risk as the public interest served by an insurance policy must prevail over the insurer's interest.
 Accordingly, the Court held,
"In the case on hand also I have already pointed out that no document is placed for having given the intimation and the same was acknowledged by the insured and unless the same is reached the insured the Insurance Company cannot avoid the liability and I have already pointed out that the Tribunal has not discussed anything about reaching of notice to insured. Under the circumstances, the contention of the Insurance Company cannot be accepted and the Tribunal has committed an error in fastening the liability on the insured instead of insurer. Hence, the claimant has made out the case to fasten the liability on the Insurance Company."

The Orissa High Court on Monday issued a slew of instructions/guidelines to the Director General of Police, Odisha (DGP) for compulsory registration of First Information Reports (FIRs), requiring him to forward the same to all the police stations of the State. Expressing disappointment over frequent cases of non-registration of FIRs by police officers, the Single Judge Bench of Dr. Justice Sanjeeb Kumar Panigrahi observed,
 "It is essential that the police officer need to be sensitized for registering the FIR throughout the State when a complainant approaches the Police Station. It is further directed that strong action should be prescribed against the erring police officer including the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against them for whimsically not registering F.I.R." Factual Background
 The petitioner had approached the Inspector-in-Charge (IIC), Astaranga police station in Puri district on 04.05.2022 for registration of FIR against the accused persons and seeking appropriate investigation thereon. However, the IIC trivially refused to register the FIR. Aggrieved by such non-registration of FIR, the petitioner approached the Superintendent of Police, Puri, by way of a representation dated 29.05.2022. However, the said representation is still pending with him. Counsel for the petitioner submitted that though he has handed over the said complaint copy to the said IIC, which has been duly received by him, but there is no endorsement or acknowledgement receipt or any stamp acknowledging the receipt to that effect by the police for which the petitioner is unable to show as to whether the copy the FIR has been received by the police station or not. Court's Order
 After perusing the materials on record and hearing the counsel, the Court observed that some amount of 'institutional lethargy' has crept in to so many police stations of the State. It also expressed resentment that many police officers are refusing to register F.I.R. whimsically or due to some extraneous circumstances. Therefore, in order to sensitise the police officers, the Court directed the DGP to issue the following instructions to all the police stations of the State:
 "a) Whenever a person comes to the Police Station with a complaint, the Officer posted at the Police Station shall compulsorily receive the complaint and endorse the complaint by way of a receipt or by way of stamp acknowledging the said receipt at that Police Station with time and date. The Police Officer shall further insist a photo copy of the said complaint to be given back to the complainant. b) While a prescribed format is not necessary, it is essential that the In-charge of the Police Station shall indicate the minimum information required to substantiate a complaint and shall suggest what supporting documents are relevant and can add weight to the complaint. c) The concerned official must be courteous to the complainant who approaches to the Police station and furnish a pen and a paper to the complainant, on request. d) The complainant may also be given a comfortable space to sit and write the complaint. e) If the person is illiterate, the complaint must be dictated by the complainant to the officer-in-charge who shall reduce the same in writing and dictate it to the complainant before it is signed and stamped by the officer. f) A copy (photo-copy) of the FIR filed must be returned to the complainant by the concerned officer free of cost." The Court directed that the contents of the order be circulated to all the police stations of the State by way of instructions from the office of Director General of Police, Odisha within a period of fifteen days. While concluding, Justice Panigrahi said that all the police officers, constabulary etc. need to be sensitized to be courteous to the public when they approach the police station and at least they should be offered a chair at the police station.

The 'Skin-to-skin' judgement passed by the Supreme Court yesterday had set aside impugned judgements of the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench).

The 'Skin-to-skin' judgement passed by the Supreme Court yesterday had set aside impugned judgements of the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench). A three-judge Bench of Justices U.U.Lalit, S.Ravindra Bhat and Bela.M.Trivedi has held that 'skin-to-skin' touch is not a requirement to constitute an offence of sexual assault under S.7 of the POCSO Act.
 The majority opinion, authored by Justice Bela Trivedi, makes a crucial observation about the manner in which certified copies of judgement be uploaded. The judgement expresses its surprise that the Registry of High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench, has certified the copy of the impugned judgment by affixing the stamp on the back side of every page of the judgment which is blank. It further notes that the said copy of the judgment appears to have been downloaded from the website and, therefore, does not bear even the  signature or the name of the concerned judge at the end of the judgment. It further notes that while it is a written statement at the foot of the judgement that the said copy is a true copy of the judgment as contemplated in Section 76 of the Indian Evidence Act is also missing. 
 Section 76 of the Indian Evidence Act provides that in case of certified copies of public documents the public officer having the custody of the public document shall provide a certificate written at the foot of such copy that it is a true copy of such document or part thereof. 
 The judgement further makes notes of the perils of not following the stipulation of Section 76: 
 "Such a practice, if followed by the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court, may allow the miscreants to manipulate or commit mischief in the judicial orders which are used as the public documents having great significance in the judicial proceedings."
 The judgment has directed the Registrar General of the Bombay High Court, to look into the matter and ensure that proper procedure for preparing the certified copies of the judgments/orders of the Court in accordance with law is followed.
 "It is very surprising to note that the Registry of High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench, has certified the copy of the impugned judgment by affixing the stamp on the back side of every page of the judgment which is blank.

The Registrar General of the Bombay High Court, therefore, is directed to look into the matter and ensure that proper procedure for preparing the certified copies of the judgments/orders of the Court in accordance with law is followed"
 Interestingly, in 2016 a Single judge Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in M/S.Spectrum Power Generation vs Mr.M.Kishna Rao had refused to interfere with the decision of the trial court raising an objection over the certified copies issued by the High Court which did not contain the certification as required by Section 76 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Further, it held that the copy of the order passed by the High Court containing no seal or certification as duly required by Section 76 of the Act cannot be called a certified copy. 
 It had observed:
 "Unless there is a seal or certification as duly required under Section 76 of the Act, when it is not called a certified copy and even the High Court Rules in no way exempt from application of the said Section for the High Court to issue a certified copy, it is the duty of the registry of the High Court to take care in certifying in compliance with Section 76 of the Act. Thus, to the extent of return of the memo by the trial court to receive the documents as not duly certified as contemplated by Section 76 of the Act, there is nothing to interfere."

The Kerala High Court on Thursday, while disposing of two pleas challenging the grant of anticipatory bail to the author and social activist Civic Chandran in a sexual harassment case, expunged the 'sexually provocative dress' remark of Kozhikode Sessions Court.
Justice Kauser Edappagath, while disposing of the two pleas moved by the State as well as the De facto complainant against the anticipatory bail order, observed that even though the reason shown by the Court below for granting anticipatory bail cannot be justified, the order granting anticipatory bail cannot be set aside. 
In these circumstances, I am of the view that even though the reason shown by the Court below for granting anticipatory bail cannot be justified, the order granting anticipatory bail by the Court below cannot be set aside.
The observations in the Kozhikode Sessions Court order, which was passed on August 12, had created a massive outrage. The court had said offence under Section 354A of the Indian Penal Code is not prima facie attracted when the woman was wearing 'sexually provocative dresses'.
In the Criminal Miscellaneous Petition filed under Sections 482 read with 439(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the State had challenged the findings and reasoning given by the Sessions Court as suffering from "illegality, lack of sensitivity, sobriety and perversity".
While passing the order, Justice Edappagath observed that the dressing of a victim cannot be construed as a legal ground to absolve an accused from the charge of outraging the modesty of a woman.
"The dressing of a victim cannot be construed as a legal ground to absolve an accused from the charge of outraging the modesty of a woman. The right to wear any dress is a natural extension of personal freedom guaranteed by the Constitution and a facet of the fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. Even if a woman wears a provocative dress that cannot give a licence to a man to outrage her modesty. Hence, the said finding of the Court below in the impugned order is hereby set aside," said the court.
The Court observed that everyone has the freedom to wear whatever he/she wants to wear, subject to the laws of the land. Objectifying women in regard to what she wears cannot be justified. There is no reason why a woman should be judged by her clothes. Furthermore, the Court observed that norms that categorize women based on their attire and expressions can never be tolerated, and it is wrong to say that a woman was sexually assaulted just because she was wearing provocative clothes. 
Everyone has the freedom to wear whatever he/she wants to wear, subject to the laws of the land. Objectifying women in regard to what she wears cannot be justified. There is no reason why a woman should be judged by her clothes. Norms that categorize woman based on her attire and expressions can never be tolerated.
Relying on the Apex Court decision in Aparna Bhat and Others v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Another in which the Court had held that discussion about the dress, behaviour, or past conduct of the victim should not enter the verdict while granting bail to the accused and it was also observed in the judgment that the Judges should not use any words, spoken or written, that would undermine or shake the confidence of the survivor in the fairness or impartiality of the court; the Court observed that the remarks in the impugned order regarding the provocative dress of the victim cannot be sustained and thereby expunged it.
The Court observed that on merits, the petitioner has made out a case for anticipatory bail. The Director General of Prosecution earlier submitted before the Court that the investigation was almost over in the case.
Therefore, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case and the age of the accused, the Court observed that custodial interrogation will not be necessary.
The Court, thereby, disposed of both the Criminal Miscellaneous Cases and upheld the grant of anticipatory bail to the accused.

In a significant judgment relating to prisoners' right, the Uttarakhand High Court has held that Police personnel cannot be appointed as Jail Superintendents.
 A Division Bench comprising of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma observed that we have come to the age of "Reformation and Rehabilitation of Prisoners".
 It held that the purpose of Police is very different from that of Jail Superintendents and as a natural corollary, their trainings and psyche are poles apart. Hence, the former cannot possess the position of the latter.
 "The purpose of the Police is not to reform, or to rehabilitate, but to prevent the occurrence of crime, and to punish the criminals. Therefore, the very training of a police personnel is carried out with a different purpose in mind, and with different goals prescribed by law. Thus, there is a vast difference in the philosophy that permeates the police administration, and the jail administration. Hence, even their training and the psychology of the police personnel and prison personnel are poles apart," the order stated.
 The observations come in a PIL challenging a State Government's order whereby the Officers of the Police Department were given the additional charge of the office of the Senior Superintendent/Superintendent of Jail at Sitarganj, Haldwani, Haridwar, Dehradun and Roorkee.
 In its judgment declaring the impugned order as illegal, the Division Bench stressed on the need for carefully selecting the prison personnel, for providing rigorous training, both prior to their joining the service, and subsequent thereto, of the appointment being a full-time, regular appointment. 
 "It is only when these factors are inculcated in the prison administration that the prison system succeeds in protecting, reforming and rehabilitating the prisoners. Otherwise, it is a self-defeating proposition," it observed.
 Prison History
 In its order, the Bench ventured into various recommendations made by several committees over a period time, for efficient prison system, well-trained full time prison staff and proper development of the prison population.
 In 1920, the Bench noted, the "All India Jail Committee" for the first time recommended the reformation and rehabilitation of offenders as one of the objectives of the prison administration. The Committee spoke about adequate training of the prison staff, and about the separation of executive/custodial, ministerial and technical staff in prison service. The Committee believed that a different sort of training needs to be provided to the prison staff, than the training being provided to the police staff
 The Jail recommendations made by Dr. WC Reckless, a UN Expert on Correctional Work, proposed the reformative theory of punishment; specialized training of correctional personnel; and the need for a cadre of properly trained personnel staff.
 In 1972, a Working Group on Prisons emphasised the need for proper training of prison personnel. It also stressed that "prison administration should be treated as an integral part of the social defence components of national planning process".
 In 1980, the All India Committee on Jail Reforms recommended that State should endeavour to develop a well-organized prison cadre based on appropriate job requirements, sound training and proper promotional avenues.
 Finally, in 2009, the Ministry of Home Affairs had written to the Principal Secretary (Prison)/Secretary (Home) (In-charge of Prisons) - All State Governments / UTs DGs/ IGs incharge of prisons- All State Governments / UTs, wherein it made certain recommendations as under:
 Establishing well equipped training infrastructure in the State, with adequate skilled and well qualified instructional staff, to cater to the normal needs of basic and in-service training for the prison staff in different discipline.Creating adequate posts for prison staff as per norms in different categories, commensurate with operational needs of safe custody, reformation, rehabilitation, health care, legal assistance etc.Filling up all the vacancies, presently running up to 17.58% (in 2006) within time bound frame and ensure proper cadre management through timely trainings, promotions, recruitments etc.
 Nelson Mandela Rules
 The Bench has also taken note of the United Nations has issued "Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners", better known as "the Nelson Mandela Rules".
 These Rules, inter alia, provide for "careful selection of every grade of the personnel"; "integrity, humanity, professional capacity, and personal suitability for the work that the proper administration of prisons depends"; appointment of prison personnel "on a full-time basis"; 
 It specifically referred to Rule 75(2) which states that "before entering on duty, all prison staff shall be provided with training tailored to their general and specific duties, which shall be reflective of contemporary evidence-based best practice in penal sciences".
 Since India is a member of the United Nations, these Rules are equally binding on the country and they cannot be ignored, observed the Court.
 Uttar Pradesh Jail (Group A and B) Service Rules, 1982
 Lastly, the Bench referred to the abovesaid Rules, which clearly provide a procedure for determination of vacancy, and selection and promotion for filling up the post in prisons.
 "A bare perusal of these Rules of 1982 clearly reveals that the post of Superintendent of Jail necessarily has to be filled up either by direct recruitment (fifty percent), or by promotion (fifty percent). The Rules do not permit an ad-hoc appointment from any other service, much less the police service. Therefore, the post can be filled up either directly from candidates from the open market, or from the post of Deputy Superintendents/Jailors having a work experience of minimum of five years. Hence, the appointment of the police personnel, by the impugned orders, is clearly illegal," it held.
 The Bench proceeded to reject the argument made by the State Government that the Inspector General of Prisons and the Additional Inspector General of Prisons can be appointed from the IPS cadre.
 It held,
 "It is a settled position of law that once a procedure has been established by law, it cannot be circumvented from. Therefore, merely because the post of Inspector General of Prisons, and Additional Inspector General of Prisons can be filled up from persons belonging to the IPS cadre, it does not empower the State to fill up the post of the lower echelons by posting police personnel on the post of Senior Superintendent/Superintendent of Jail."

Read Order

The Karnataka High Court has directed the Chief Election Commission, State Election Commission and the Police Department to provide proper training to the officials, who are attached to the Election flying squad, on the procedure to be followed while reporting offences pertaining to Election Code violation. 
A single judge bench of Justice K Natarajan said most of the cases registered by the Police on the complaint filed by flying squad remain only as an empty formality during the election and finally in most of the cases, the Police files 'B' final report when the candidate is elected or files the charge-sheet against the losing candidate, "even though the police knowing very well that in a non-cognizable offence, the FIR cannot be registered without permission of the Magistrate.”
The court said there is a gross violation of the procedures by the police in registering the FIRs without obtaining permission from the Magistrate under Section 155 of Cr.P.C. in non-cognizable offence. “They are facilitating the accused persons to escape from the clutches of law even though huge amounts were seized by the flying squad apart from other articles etc,” observed the court.
Thus, it issued the following directions:
(i) If any such non-cognizable offences were found committed, the informant have to obtain permission under Section 155(2) of Cr.P.C. by very informant shall approach the Magistrate under Section 155(1)
of Cr.P.C. and thereafter, the Magistrate shall accord permission under Section 155(2) of Cr.P.C. by application of mind by following the judgment of the Co-ordinate Bench in the case of Vaggeppa Gurulinga Jangaligi (Jangalagi) vs. The State of Karnataka, ILR 2020 KAR 630 and then the police to register the FIR and file the charge sheet.
(ii) In respect of offences punishable under Section 188 of IPC, though it is cognizable offence, the complainant or the flying squad shall not file any complaint before the Police under Section 154(1) of Cr.P.C., but, the complainant can seize the materials by preparing panchanama in the presence of witnesses, based upon the power conferred by the Election Commission of India and thereafter, the Election Commission of India may authorize the complainant to file the complaint under Section 2(d) read with Section 200 of Cr.P.C. along with the documents before the Magistrate as per Section 195(1)(a)(iii) of Cr.P.C. 
It also said: “The Magistrate can take cognizance and dispense with the recording of sworn statements of the complainant-public servant and then pass the order by issuing the process under Section 204 of Cr.P.C. in accordance with law.” 
The directions were given while allowing a petition filed by one A Manju and quashing the proceedings initiated against him under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Section 126 of Representation of People of Act, 1950 (for short 'R.P. Act'). 
It was alleged that on 17.04-2019, the complainant (Flying squad officer) came to know that the petitioner who was the BJP Lok Sabha candidate for Hassan constituency conducted a press meet at Mallige Hotel, Hassan, in spite of imposing curfew under Section 144 of Cr.P.C. The Police after registering the FIR under Section 188 of IPC and 126 of R.P. Act. filed the charge-sheet, which was challenged before the court.
The court said in view of the bar under Section 195(1)(a)(i) and (iii) of Cr.P.C., the Magistrate is barred to take cognizance without filing complaint by the complainant under Section 2(d) read with Section 200 of Cr.P.C. 
"The Police have no authority to register the FIR without permission of the Court for non cognizable offence. Therefore, the criminal proceedings against the petitioner is not sustainable under the law and have to be quashed,” it added.

The Supreme Court, in a judgment delivered on Tuesday (7 September 2021) upheld the dismissal of a 'Title' suit filed 54 years ago on 5th August 1967.
We find that the judgment of the trial court dismissing the suit is correct, the bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna observed while setting aside the Patna High Court order and first appellate court order that had decreed the suit.
The 'Title' suit in this case was filed before the court of Subordinate Judge, Sitamarhi, was dismissed by it on 31st May, 1986. The first appellate court, on 7th December, 1988, allowed the appeal preferred by plaintiffs and decreed the suit.
 The second appeal preferred by the legal heirs of  the defendant was dismissed by a single Judge of the High Court on 25th May, 1989, by a short order recording that the findings of facts observed by the first appellate court were final finding of facts and no substantial question of law arose. They thus approached the Supreme Court, which observed that the High Court was not correct in dismissing the appeal in limine as there was a serious dispute concerning title of the land. Vide order dated 23rd February, 2000, the case was remanded for de novo consideration by the High Court. On 20th March, 2009, the High Court, after considering the matter afresh dismissed the second appeal. 
In appeal, the Apex Court bench considered whether the plaintiffs have established their title over the suit land and hence were entitled to a decree of possession against legal heirs of the deceased defendant. The High Court had that the plaintiffs had title over the suit land. 
Taking note of the evidence on record, the court found that the plaintiffs were not owners of the property on the date they had filed the present suit for title and possession on 5th August, 1967. Therefore, it set aside the judgments of first appellate court and High Court and upheld the dismissal of the suit by the Trial Court.

Observing that the incidents of attacks on main-stream politicians and the people who do not subscribe to the separatists ideology are still taking place in Kashmir Valley, the Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Thursday allowed an application filed by former health minister Shabir Ahmed Khan seeking transfer of criminal proceedings against him from a court in Srinagar to a Jammu court.
Ex-Health Minister Khan was accused of molesting a lady doctor, who happened to be the wife of a separatist leader. Subsequently, a first information report came to be registered against him on February 6, 2014 at Shaheed Gunj police station in Srinagar for allegedly committing the offences punishable under section 354 (outraging modesty of woman) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Ranbir Penal Code (RPC).
In his transfer plea the petitioner submitted that he had engaged the service of advocate Mohd Abdullah Pandit for defending his case before the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Srinagar and when the said advocate argued his case before the Magistrate, he received threat to his life. As a consequence, he refused to appear on behalf of the petitioner, it was pointed out.
Petitioner Khan further submitted that two more lawyers, advocates Maroof Khan and Shokat were approached by the petitioner to appear on his behalf but they also refused to accept the brief of the petitioner.
He contended that atmosphere surrounding the court premises is highly surcharged and hostile and whenever, he appears before the court, slogans are being raised against him inside and outside the court premises, the plea said.
The Court remains jam packed and the petitioner apprehends grave and serious bodily attack from the crowd which gathers over there upon the instigation of the separatists, he averred.
After hearing the contentions Justice Sanjay Dhar observed that the apprehension of the petitioner that he will not receive a fair trial in the case at Srinagar, appeared to be well founded.
"It is a fact of common knowledge that incidents of attacks on main-stream politicians and the people who do not subscribe to the separatists ideology are still taking place in Kashmir valley. Therefore, it cannot be stated that apprehension expressed by the petitioner to his life at Srinagar while facing trial before the court is unfounded," the Court said.
Pointing out to the fact that the contention of petitioner that at least three advocates in Srinagar whom he had approached to take up his case, showed their inability to do so, has remained un-rebutted and that the respondent No. 2 happens to be wife of a separatist leader, who wields some influence amongst certain sections of people living in the valley who subscribe to his ideology, the court observed that the apprehension expressed by the petitioner to his life while facing trial before a Srinagar court cannot be said to be unfounded.
Accordingly, the Court allowed the plea and allowed transfer of the trial from Srinagar court to Jammu court and directed parties to appear before the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jammu on April 12 by which date, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Srinagar should transfer the original records of the file to the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jammu.
Case Title: Shabir Ahmed Khan V/s State of J&K & Anr.

The Delhi High Court on Monday directed the Delhi Government to issue a circular directing that the identity of a minor girl, who is seeking medical termination of her pregnancy, and her family shall not be disclosed in the report prepared by registered medical practitioners (RMP) to the police.
Section 19(1) of POCSO Act provides mandatory reporting of child sexual offences to the Special Juvenile Police Unit or the local police.
Justice Prathiba M Singh passed the direction after observing that the minors and their families may be forced to approach non-registered and unqualified medical practitioners, midwives and courts to terminate the pregnancies which could result in adverse impact on the health of the minor.
The court relied upon the Supreme Court judgment in X v. The Principal Secretary Health and Family Welfare Govt NCT of Delhi & Anr wherein registered medical practitioners have been exempted from mandatorily reporting the offences of "consensual sexual activity" under the POCSO Act. 
Noting that as per the current position, the medical practitioners are “generally reluctant to carry out termination of pregnancy” without disclosing identity of the minor and her family and without lodging a police report, the court directed:
“Thus, in terms of the order passed by the Supreme Court, the GNCTD is directed to issue a circular to the effect that in case of any minor or the minor along with the family approaching any RMP for termination of a pregnancy, the identity of the minor, the guardian or the family, as may be deemed to be appropriate, shall not be disclosed in the RMP’s report to the police.”
The court further said that the termination of pregnancy shall be carried out in terms of the relevant procedures.
“The police shall also ensure that in such cases, the report which is registered does not disclose the identity of the minor or her family,” the court added. 
The court was hearing a petition filed by a woman for medical termination of her 14 -year-old daughter's pregnancy without reporting the matter to the local police as the same, she said, would lead to social stigma, ostracization and harassment.
The foetus was 15 weeks and 4 days old as on January 6. According to the petition, the pregnancy arose out of a consensual relationship between the girl and a minor boy. 
While the minor’s pregnancy was already terminated followed by an order passed by the court, Justice Singh noted that the petition raised “an urgent and immediate cause of concern” in respect of termination of pregnancies in case of the “unfortunate event of the pregnant person being a minor girl.”
The mother in her plea argued that the minor daughter did not want to continue the pregnancy as she was not physically and mentally prepared to raise the child and continuance of the same would cause immense injury to her physical and mental health. 
Apart from seeking medical termination of pregnancy, the plea also sought direction on the Delhi Government to pass a circular or notification for Government and Private Hospitals, Registered Centers and Registered Medical Practitioners for providing services of medical termination of unwarranted pregnancy to minor girls, arising from consensual sexual activity, without reporting the case to the local police in the light of Supreme Court ruling.
During the course of hearing, the counsel appearing for Delhi Government highlighted another issue in cases of consensual sex between minors.
“There is another aspect to it, now when we are talking about it, it is only by keeping the female child in mind. Now the effect of that is also there on the male child. Again in the case of a consensual sex like the present one where both male and female child are involved, but the police registered the case as required under the POCSO Act. They boy's family's harassed, protection has not been given under the Act, nor by the judgment,” the counsel said. 
Responding to the same, Justice Singh orally said: “The whole problem is, in case of a male child, if it's a minor there's one issue. Second issue is if it's consensual or not. Third is if it is a major, then all three situations will have to be seen.”
Directing the Delhi Government to address the issue so raised in an affidavit, the court listed the matter for hearing on March 10. 
“You deal with it in your affidavit. On the next date I'll consider,” the court said. 
As the petitioner’s counsel highlighted the situation in cases where the minor girl and her family do not want to pursue the case and do not want investigation against the boy, as in the present case, the court remarked:
“Should we permit that ... is the question. Then what stops the boy from having other relationships?…There has to be some check on it, no?”

Stressing that turban is an essential religious symbol, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has recently observed that photographing an elderly person in an injured condition without the turban and uploading it for public viewing on a social platform would prima facie amount to hurting the religious feelings. This assertion came from the bench of Justice Anupinder Singh Grewal while dealing with the anticipatory bail plea of Gurpreet Singh and others who allegedly took off the turban of a 65 year old elderly and repeatedly beat him up. Apart from this, allegedly, the petitioner and other accused also video-graphed him without the turban when he was bleeding and the same had been uploaded on Facebook. Thereafter, the petitioners were booked under sections 323, 341, 506, 295A, 148 & 149 IPC and Section 66-E of the Information Technology Act, 2000. It was argued on their behalf that the said sections are bailable and prima facie case under Section 295-A would not be made out inasmuch as DSP in the inquiry had stated that the allegations of hurting the religious feelings of the complainant were not made out. On the other hand, the counsel for the complainant contended that the turban of the 65-year-old complainant had been removed, was repeatedly beaten up and abused. Thereafter, the incident was video-recorded and uploaded on Facebook. Stressing that the turban is an essential religious symbol and photographing an elderly person in an injured condition without the turban and uploading it for public viewing on a social platform would prima facie amount to hurting the religious feelings, the Court opined thus:
"I do not agree with the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that a prima facie case under Section 295-A IPC is not made out. In view of the serious allegations against the petitioner, I do not intend to grant the concession of anticipatory bail." With this, the petition for anticipatory bail plea was dismissed. 
The Delhi High Court has directed the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to conclude proceedings initiated against schools which are found in violation of its bye-laws within six months. 
A division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad disposed of a public interest litigation seeking CBSE enquiry into the transactions between education societies and franchise schools and also to inspect affairs of schools operated by Delhi Public School Society (DPSS).
The petitioners were aggrieved by the commercialization of education and corrosion of standards of education management. The plea alleged that the Society through its Chairman executed various franchise agreements with several schools for permitting certain other schools to use the name of Delhi Public School, its logo and motto.
The CBSE in its response stated that it grants affiliation to the schools subject to fulfilment of the norms and its bye-laws. 
It added that as per the applicable bye-laws, various Delhi Public Schools have been established under different trusts and societies having affiliation with the CBSE, and that their name, per se, was not DPS but they had added names like DPS Ghaziabad and DPS Madhubani Pvt. Ltd. with a different logo.
It stated that as and when a complaint is received, action has been initiated by schools and that appropriate action shall be taken in accordance with law, strictly in consonance with its bye-laws.
In another affidavit, the Board also stated that appropriate action was initiated against schools which were found to be in violation of its extant bye-laws.
Taking note of the responses, the court said that CBSE has taken stern action from time to time against schools, including imposition of penalty, which have violated the extant affiliation bye-laws. 
“In view of the same, no further orders are required to be passed in the present PIL,” it said. 
On the petitioners’ allegation about irregularities in respect of DPSS, the court directed that they shall be free to take recourse to other remedies available under law keeping in view Societies Registration Act, 1860, and other statutory provisions governing the field. 
“However, CBSE is directed to conclude all proceedings which have been initiated in respect of various schools mentioned in the PIL as well as in respect of other schools which have been mentioned in the affidavits filed by the CBSE positively within a period of six months from the date of receipt of certified copy of this order,” it said.

The Allahabad High Court on Monday refused to quash the criminal case against a government teacher and a madrasa teacher from whose possession cow meat (beef) and 16 live cattle were recovered.
The Bench Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal observed that the First Information Report (FIR) that prima facie cognizable offence is made out against the applicants and thus, no case was made out to quash the case against them.
The case in brief
The Court was dealing with the 482 CrPC plea filed by 4 applicants booked under Sections 153- A, 420, 429, 188, 269, 270, 273 I.P.C. and section 3/5/8 of Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, 1955 and section 11 of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1979 and section 7/8 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 seeking to quash the case. 
Applicant no. 1 is an Assistant Teacher in the education department of the State, while applicant no. 2 is also working as Assistant Teacher in Madrasa Darul Ulum Gausia Kasba Salempur, while applicant no. 3 is running a medical shop and applicant no. 4 is Hafiz Quran.
It was their submission that a report from the Forensic Investigation Laboratory had received did not disclose that the sample sent for analysis was of the cow. It was their case that no case under the Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act was made out. 
On the other hand, the State counsel argued that the FIR is a detailed report which categorically mentioned that out of 16 live cattle stock which included 7 buffaloes, 1 cow, 2 female buffalo's calf, 5 male buffalo's calf, and one male cow-calf. 
Thus, it was argued by the state that it was wrong to say that the FSL report gave a clean chit to the applicants, as 16 cattle were found in the possession of the applicants and other co-accused and they were not having any license to run the slaughterhouse.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court discarded the argument of the applicants that no offence was made out from the reading of the First Information Report, as the Court underscored that even though the FSL report had revealed that the sample which was sent for chemical analysis was not cow meat, but, 16 live cattle were also recovered from the custody of the applicants and another co-accused.
"I find from the perusal of the First Information Report that prima facie cognizable offence is made out against the applicants and only the report of the lab about the chemical analysis of the sample which was sent having been found not to be cow meat but 16 live stock cattle have been found in the custody of the applicants along with other materials, a list of which has been given in First Information Report and there being no license with the applicants for running slaughterhouse, prima facie, the offence is made out and charge sheet having been submitted, and there being serious allegations, no ground is made out for quashing the proceedings..."
Consequently, observing that defence regarding the FSL report shall be considered by the trial court as such defence set up in the present application cannot be considered by this Court at this stage, at the stage of quashing of the charge sheet.
With this, the case was dismissed.

The Madras High Court recently expressed alarm at the "day in and day out" illegal transportation and slaughter of cows and other animals in open places in the State.
A division bench of Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice N Mala observed that such situation can arise only when the administration fails to ensure compliance of the provisions of the statutory laws and does not take timely action against the defaulters.
The court was hearing a plea claiming that the provisions with respect to prevention of cruelty to animals namely the Tamil Nadu Animal Preservation Act, 1958, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960; the Transport of Animals Rules, 1978, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Transport of Animals on Foot) Rules, 2001; the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Slaughter House) Rules, 2001, the Prevention of Cruelty in Animals (Regulation of Livestock Markets) Rules, 2017 and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Care and Maintenance of Case Property Animals) Rules, 2017 etc were being violated in the state.
 The court observed that despite having sufficient statutes, the police administration has failed to take action against those involved in illegal transport, slaughter and auction of animals.
 We find that despite the provisions aforesaid, the State authorities, which may include the Police administration, failed to take immediate action on the illegal transportation of the animals and their slaughtering and even the illegal auction.
 The state did not oppose the grant of prayer and instead listed out all the steps taken by the State to ensure strict compliance to the rules. The State also informed the court that all departments were working with the Police and the Transport department to put a check on illegal transport and slaughtering. 
 The State also informed the court that The Tamil Nadu Animal Welfare Board was formed to promote animal welfare and to ensure strict implementation to the acts. The functions of the Board was also elaborately discussed. It was also submitted that a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals whose function was to inform the Police Department regarding violation of the provisions of the Act and the Rules while transporting the animals or slaughtering.
 The court found merit in the plea by the petitioners and issued the following directions for protection of animals:
 1. The State through its departments was to ensure that no slaughtering or transportation takes place in violation of the laws and rules 
 2. The District Level Committee and the State Board was to ensure strict compliance of the rules and regulations. 
 3. Any person found to be in violation was to be dealt with for violation of the provisions of the Act of 1960 and the Rules of 1978 and 2001 and immediate action was to be taken with registration of cases against the accused.
 4. The Transportation Department was to monitor the transportation of animals. For this purpose CCTV camera footage available at Check Posts, Toll Gates etc were to be made available to the District Level Committee.
 5. The State was to ensure that slaughtering was done in accordance to the Rules and at a licensed Slaughter house and not in any open space.
 6. Whenever illegal transportation of animals was brought to the notice of the authorities, cases were to be registered against the offenders and at the same time the animals were to be recovered and kept in safe custody. 
 7. Periodical monitoring was to be conducted and no animal was to be allowed to enter the territory of the State of Tamil Nadu in violation of the Rules.
 8. Slaughtering should not be permitted in violation of the provision of Section 4 of the Act of 1958.
 9. The state was to ensure that auction of animals was also according to the rules and procedures.
 10. The District Level Committee was to be supplied a copy of the order to ensure regular compliance of the procedures. 
 11. In case of any violation, it would be immediately brought to the notice of the Superintendent of Police concerned to register a case with further action in the matter. The District Collector was also to ensure that no transportation or slaughtering of animals takes place in his district in violation of the directions given by the Court.

The Delhi High Court has observed that the practice of filing representations, in an attempt to extend the cause of action as a ground to overcome the delay, should be discouraged.
Justice Sanjeev Narula made the observation while dismissing a petition filed by Vindhya Gurukul College against the decision taken by Northern Regional Committee of NCTE in its 266th meeting wherein it was granted recognition for only 50 seats (one basic unit) of B.Ed. course, as opposed to the original decision taken in an earlier meeting wherein recognition was granted with an annual intake of 100 seats (two basic units). 
The Petitioners had thus sought a direction to restore the recognition in terms of the original decision dated 20th May, 2016 or in the alternative, a direction to the Respondents to decide it's representations.
It was the case of the Petitioners that NRC could not have suo moto reviewed the earlier decision vide subsequent Order dated 17th April, 2017 and reduce the intake of the College from 100 seats to 50 seats without specifying any reason for the same.
When the Court queried the counsel of petitioners about the gross delay on their in impugning the orders, it was argued that several representations were made by them against the decisions which were not considered by the Respondents authorities. 
On the other hand, the Respondents contended that the minutes of NRC in its meeting dated 20th May, 2016 were only published on the website and there was no formal communication issued for the recognition as contended by the Petitioners.
The Court thus noted that the subsequent Order dated 17th April, 2017 was well-within the knowledge of the Petitioners and the same was passed after affording an opportunity of hearing. 
"Therefore, if the Petitioners had any grievance, it ought to have exercised its remedies, in accordance with law and in time," it noted. 
The Court was of the view that merely by making representations, the Petitioners cannot extend the cause of action. 
"Therefore, pendency of the representations cannot be a ground to explain the delay. Petitioners should have impugned the subsequent Order dated 17th April, 2017 expeditiously and within reasonable time, by approaching a court of law, if no statutory remedy was available, as contended by the Petitioners. Filing multiple representations cannot be considered a ground for ignoring the gross delay on their part in approaching the Court," the Court observed. 
Taking note of the fact that the Petitioners were guilty of delay and laches, the Court observed that the petition deserved to be rejected at the said threshold. 
"By seeking the alternate prayer, Petitioners are seeking an opportunity to subsequently contend that rejection of the representation has given a fresh cause of action. This cannot be permitted in the facts of the case discussed," the Court said. 
It added "In fact, such a practice of filing representations, in an attempt to extend the cause of action as a ground to overcome the delay, should be discouraged."
Accordingly, the plea was dismissed.

The Telangana High Court has recently observed that the assurance given by some Ruling Party or by the Chief Minister or even by His Excellency the Governor does not become the law of the land.
The assertion came from the bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A.Rajasheker Reddy while dismissing a clutch of petitions seeking retrospective implementation of the State Government's decision to enhance the retirement age for government jobs from 58 or 60 years to 61 years.
Background 
Essentially, the State Legislature passed the Telangana Public Employment (Regulation of Age of Superannuation) (Amendment) Act, 2021, under which the age of superannuation of public employees had been enhanced from 58 years to 61 years.
This particular act did not contain the date of enforcement of the act, however, through a Government Order, the State Government, on March 30, 2021, notified that the said Act shall be deemed to have come into force on March 30th, 2021.
This meant that the employees who were due to retire on March 30 or later, were entitled to the benefit of the Act passed by the state government. Challenging the Government order, some retired employees (prior to March 30) moved to the High Court.
The submissions of the petitioners
At the outset, the Petitioners argued that the employees who have superannuated prior to March 2021, had been discriminated against by the Government and therefore, they claimed that the Amending Act of 2021 and Government Order, are violative of Articles 14, 16, and 20 of the Constitution of India.
They also argued that keeping in view the Pay Revision Commission's Report, the Amending Act should have been made applicable with retrospective effect i.e., from 31.12.2020.
Significantly, the petitioners also contended that the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) Party had, in the year 2018, given an assurance at the time of elections for enhancing the age of superannuation of Telangana Government employees to 61 years and the matter was pending consideration.
The petitioners further stated that the Governor of Telangana too, in a Republic Day Speech given in 2021, had made a promise in respect of enhancement of retirement age. 
Against this backdrop, raising the issue of promissory estoppel, the petitioner's submitted that once a promise has been made by the State Government for enhancing the age of superannuation from 58 years to 61 years in the year 2018 at the time of Assembly Elections, the State Government cannot deny the benefit of enhancement in retirement age.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court observed that the fixation of cut-off date does not warrant any interference as fixation of cut-off date always leaves a large number of employees unsatisfied.
Further, noting that the petitioners have not been able to establish before this Court as to how it is discriminatory, arbitrary, or violative of Articles 14, 16, and 21 of the Constitution of India, the Court observed thus:
"The assurance given by some Ruling Party or by the Chief Minister or even by His Excellency the Governor does not become the law of the land. It is the domain of the Legislature to enact an Act or to amend an Act and the same has rightly been done by the State Legislature by amending the Telangana Public Employment (Regulation of Age of Superannuation) Act, 1984 with the Telangana Public Employment (Regulation of Age of Superannuation) (Amendment) Act, 2021 (Act No.3 of 2021)."
Regarding the issue of promissory estoppel, the Court referred to the Apex Court's ruling in the case of New Okhla Industrial Development Authority v. B.D.Singhal LL 2021 SC 297, wherein the Top Court had held that the enhancement of superannuation age is a policy matter.
In this case, the Supreme Court had set aside a judgment of the Allahabad High Court which directed that retrospective effect from September 2002 should be given to the decision taken by the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (NOIDA) in September 2012 to enhance the retirement age of its employees from 58 to 60. 
Allowing an appeal filed by the NOIDA against the judgment, a bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah had observed that the High Court trenched upon a domain of executive policy regarding retirement age.
"The infirmity in the judgment lies in the fact that the High Court has trenched upon the realm of policy making and has assumed to itself, jurisdiction over a matter which lies in the domain of the executive. Whether the age of superannuation should be increased and if so, the date from which this should be effected is a matter of policy into which the High Court ought not to have entered", the Bench had observed.

With this, the Telangana High Court didn't find any reason to interfere with the Amending Act No.3 of 2021 and the Government Order vide G.O.Ms.No.45, dated 30.03.2021, and to direct the State to grant the benefit of the Amending Act and the Government Order with retrospective effect and therefore, the writ pleas were dismissed.
In July this year, the Delhi High Court had held that a promise or assurance given by the Chief Minister in a press conference amounts to an enforceable promise and that a CM is expected to exercise his authority to give effect to such a promise.
A single-judge bench comprising of Justice Pratibha M Singh had observed thus:
"The promise/assurance/representation given by the CM clearly amounts to an enforceable promise, the implementation of which ought to be considered by the Government. Good governance requires that promises made to citizens, by those who govern, are not broken, without valid and justifiable reasons."
However, the Delhi High Court's division bench had, later on, temporarily stayed this order.
Further, while upholding the detention of a man, accused of black marketing of Remdesivir injections amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the Madhya Pradesh High Court had, in July 2021, observed that the social media posts of a Chief Minister can't be equated with an administrative order/instruction. 
A Division Bench of Justices Sujoy Paul and Anil Verma had further held that it is not necessary that every social media post of a government functionary is seen/read out and followed in the administrative hierarchy.

In a significant order, the Allahabad High Court has asked the UP Govt as to what is the requirement to appoint so many Additional Advocate Generals and Chief Standing Counsels at Allahabad High Court (both Benches) to defend the State when already more than 400 State lawyers are impaneled by it.
The Bench of Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal also took expectation to the practice of outsourcing the lawyers on behalf of the State and its various authorities and corporations wherein a big amount of taxpayers' money is being used.
Essentially, the Court was dealing with a contempt petition in a land acquisition matter. When the court reserved its Judgment, the Additional Advocate General M. C. Chaturvedi made a request that his appearance be recorded not only for the State of U.P. but also for the Ghaziabad Development Authority.
Expressing its displeasure over his request, the Court pointed toward a routine feature in its order that it has come across cases wherein the Additional Advocate General and the Chief Standing Counsel appointed by the State Government also hold briefs of various development authorities and the corporations.
Against this backdrop, noting that the Additional Advocate Generals and Chief Standing Counsel take more interest in appearing in the matters of development authorities and corporations, the Court observed thus:
"There are huge number of cases where the assistance from the State side is needed but the assistance is not available to the Court. If the Additional Advocate Generals and Chief Standing Counsel have sufficient time to represent the development authorities and corporations, then there is no need for the State to have such large panels of lawyers and incur huge financial liability. After all it is the tax payers money which is being used in the payment of State counsel. This Court also wants to bring to the notice of the Government that there is lot of outsourcing of the lawyers on behalf of State and its various authorities and corporations and a big amount of tax payers money is being used."
The court further added that in case, any such bills have been raised by any Additional Advocate General or Chief Standing Counsel from the State and development authority or corporation of the State in one case, the said amount should be recovered from him as it is taxpayers money which cannot be misused.
Importantly, the Court also observed that it is expected from the State to have a balanced and competent panel of lawyers without any need for assistance from outsiders. 
In this regard, the Court stressed that the appearance of lawyers not from the panel of the State shows that the lawyers impaneled with the State don't have much competence to defend the State and its authorities and corporations.
Further, the Court directed the Chief Secretary, Government of U.P. to apprise the working of the State Law Department in Allahabad High Court and place the matter/order before the Cabinet for taking appropriate action and make a draft plan as to how the working is to be improved regarding the State counsel in the Allahabad High Court as well as its Lucknow Bench.
"Thereafter, the Cabinet may take decision, as required, in the best interest of the State. The Chief Secretary, Government of U.P. shall intimate the progress made in the aforesaid matter to the Registrar General of this Court within two months," the Court remarked as it parted with the order.
Case title - Ishan International Educational Society Through its Director v. Shri Mukul Singhal Principal Secretary And 4 Others
Case citation -  (AB) 271

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has reiterated that where a person is engaged in a statutory corporation on the basis of a special contract, Article 311 has no application. The provision relates to dismissal, removal or reduction in rank of persons employed in civil capacities under the Union or a State.
While hearing the plea where the services of a Media Assistant engaged in the Srinagar Municipal Corporation on consolidated wages for a fixed period were terminated, Justice Javed Iqbal Wani observed,
"The fact that a statutory Corporation, exercising statutory powers may be a "State" within the purview of Article 12 of the Constitution, however, would not necessarily lead to the conclusion that its employees hold a civil post under the State as the questions under the two provisions i.e. Article 311 and Article 12 being different. The Apex Court in case titled as "Satish Chandra vs. Union of India, reported in AIR 1953 SC 250" has held that where a person is engaged in a statutory corporation on the basis of a special contract upon certain terms and conditions, Article 311 has no application as the engagement of the person would be an ordinary case of a contract terminated under its stipulated terms and conditions."
The initial engagement of the petitioner came to be extended by the Corporation with periodical enhancement in the monthly remuneration by issuance of various office orders from time to time up till the year 2012. Because of the recurring nature of her services, continuously utilised by the Corporation, the petitioner claimed regularization. However, instead, the Corporation issued a termination order.
 Petitioner contended that she is entitled to protection under Article 311 and that she has a right to hold the post which could not have been abridged arbitrarily and in contravention of due course of law.
At the outset, Justice Wani observed that term "post" used in Article 311 denotes an "office" and a post under the State has been held to be an office or position to which duties in connection with the affairs of the State are attached, an office or a position to which a person is appointed and which exists apart from and independent of the holder of the post. Thus, unless there is a post (civil post) against which a person is appointed, provisions of Article 311 cannot said to be attracted, the bench underscored.
 In this case, the Court observed that petitioner came to be hired as an awareness campaign expert on consolidated and temporary basis "terminable at any time". Thus, the Court was of the view that her engagement cannot per-se be said to be against a 'post', particularly in absence of any material produced in this regard and the specific stand taken by the respondents that the engagement was never ever against any post.
 "The engagement of the petitioner seemingly is an ordinary case of a service contract terminable at any time under the terms provided therein the engagement order. Thus, the case setup by the petitioner and the contention of the counsel for the petitioner urged in this regard in general and the applicability of the provisions of Article 311 of the Constitution in particular therefore, is not entertainable in law", Justice Wani held.
 Accordingly the bench found the claim of the petitioner for regularization as legally not tenable and hence dismissed the petition.

The Rajasthan High Court observed that Section 11 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 makes it abundantly clear that organising marriage is a sine qua non 
to constitute an offence under the Act. However, mere engagement of a child in any case does not amount to an offence under Section 11, added the court. Section 11 of the Act provides punishment for promoting or permitting solemnisation of child marriages while Section 15 of the Act states that notwithstanding anything contained in the CrPC), an offence punishable under this Act shall be cognizable and non-bailable. 
Justice Dinesh Mehta observed, 
"A perusal of Section 11 of the Act of 2006, makes it abundantly clear that organising marriage is a sine qua non to constitute an offence under the Act of 2006. Engagement of a child in any case does not amount to an offence under Section 11 of the Act of 2006. Admittedly, on the fateful day of 25.02.2020, petitioner's son was getting engaged which cannot be confused with or construed to be a marriage, falling foul to the provisions of the Act of 2006."
 Essentially, on 25.02.2020, a function for the engagement of the petitioner's son was going on, when the Investigating Officer approached the place. As per FIR lodged by District Legal Service Authority for the purported offence under Sections 11 and 15 of the Act, there is clear assertion of the engagement ceremony being solemnized and a notice being issued to the petitioner warning him not to hold the marriage of his son. 
By way of the present misc. petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the petitioner has challenged the proceedings pending before the trial Court pursuant to the said FIR registered at Police Station Osian, District Jodhpur (Rural). Notably, as per the FIR, the petitioner had simply organised an engagement ceremony for his son and no marriage had taken place. 
The court noted that the complainant and the Investigating Officer knowing it fully well that the function was for engagement have lodged/registered FIR treating the act of arranging engagement ceremony to be an act 'promoting child marriage', completely ignoring the fact that 'contracting child marriage' is a foundational prerequisite. 
It is rather unfortunate that the petitioner had to remain behind bars for 3 to 4 days, opined the court. The court added that consequently, the petitioner had been placed under suspension by his employer and he is facing departmental enquiry for an act which by itself does not constitute an offence by any stretch of imagination. 
In addition to this, the court observed, 
"It is a fit case where this Court should exercise its inherent power under Section 482 of the Code not only because the proceedings are fundamentally void but also in order to eschew abuse of the process of Court and to save the petitioner from unnecessary harassment and drastic consequences. The present misc. petition is thus, allowed. The proceedings of CRO No.293/2020, pending before the Judicial Magistrate, Osian, Jodhpur pursuant to FIR No.0116 dated 27.05.2020, are hereby quashed."
 The court directed that a copy of this order should be sent to the Secretary, District Legal Service Authority, Jodhpur. 
The counsel for the petitioner pointed out that there is a clear indication of serving a notice to the petitioner enjoining upon him not to contract his son's marriage. He argued that since marriage had not taken place, neither the FIR could be registered for the offences under Sections 11 and 15 of the Act of 2006 nor could the court take cognizance and frame charges against the petitioner. Highlighting petitioner's plight, he informed that the petitioner was arrested and remained behind bars for more than 48 hours before he could be enlarged on bail; as a result he has not only been placed under suspension, but even forced to face departmental enquiry. 
The Public Prosecutor was not in the position to establish from the record that the petitioner's son had contracted marriage on 25.02.2020. He, however, argued that organising engagement ceremony amounts to promoting child marriage and thus, petitioner is being rightly tried for the offences under the Act of 2006. 
Adv. Hari Singh Rajpurohit appeared for the petitioner while PP Gaurav Singh appeared for the respondent-state.

Justice N. Anand Venkatesh was hearing the second appeal filed by the temple against the lower appellate court judgment and decree restraining them from putting up construction in Mariamman Koil street.
"There used to be a time when some individuals developed an impression that they can encroach upon a public space in the name of a temple or by planting an idol in that place...Courts cannot be hoodwinked by encroaching and constructing a temple in the name of God. We have enough temples and no God has made any request to construct new temples by encroaching upon public space or by raising a structure in the name of the temple", the court further added in the order.
After perusing the reports submitted by the Advocate Commissioner, the court expressed its disapproval about the temple proceeding with the construction despite a status quo order and, in fact, completing the construction.
The single bench was also critical about the conduct of the Municipality in the issue. The Municipality had earlier sent a notice to the defendant temple to immediately stop the encroachments made upon the public street. Later, when the suit came to be filed, Municipality took the stand that the Government was in control of the street since it was a Sarkar Poramboke land. The court agreed with the lower appellate court and remarked that such technical pleas cannot justify the act of the temple.
"In the present case, it is quite unfortunate that the 2nd defendant Municipality virtually attempted to wash off their hands by blindly supporting a flagrant encroachment made by the 1st defendant Temple. This sudden change of stand taken by the 2nd defendant was probably due to some official who was handling the case wrongly understanding the term "God Fearing". 
About another stance taken by the defendants that the Government has been added as a party since the schedule property has been categorised as poramboke land, the bench reiterated that this too was a hypertechnical plea that wouldn't whitewash the public wrong committed y the temple.
"In cases of this nature, the Courts should not be swayed by technical objections and the overall interest of the public must be the guiding factor", the court added.
Relying on K.Sudarsan  & Ors vs. The Commissioner, Corporation of Madras & Ors (1983), the court observed that the right of the member of the general public to use every inch of a highway or a public street cannot be shaken at all. In the light of the above judgment, there is no requirement for the plaintiffs to establish any right of easement to the property, the court added:
"Even assuming that the plaintiffs have alternate access to their property, that does not mean that the plaintiffs can be deprived of their right to use a public street for ingress and egress to their property.... It was further held [in K Sudasan]  that the owner of the property adjacent to a public street has got the right to access such street at any point at which his property actually touches the street."
The court concluded that the second defendant Municipality was maintaining the street for the general public and there are official records mentioning the street. The lower appellate court had also rendered a finding that there was a tar road in the street which was removed when the suit was filed and there is only space for one person to barely go through the street on account of temple's construction activities now.
"This construction had also virtually prevented the plaintiffs from having ingress and egress to their property", the court noted.
"The photographs that were produced before this Court shows that the plaintiffs have been completely prevented from having any access to the public street from their property. They have to be literally air dropped into their property. The conduct of the 1 st defendant Temple is highly condemnable".
Stating the above, the High Court refused to tinker with the judgment and decree made by the lower appellate court in favour of the plaintiffs.

The Allahabad High Court recently granted bail to a self-styled international Hindu Leader and Yogi Sena Pramukh, Kuldeep Sharma @ Kuldeep Hindu who has been accused of taking money from the public at large by way of cheating.
The Bench of Justice Krishan Pahal granted him bail considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case, and the period of incarceration while keeping in view the nature of the offence, evidence on record regarding, his complicity, and the larger mandate of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. He was in jail since December 2020.
Sharma, who is facing charges under sections 419, 420, 467, 469 IPC and Sections 66-C I.T. (Amendment) Act, allegedly misused the popularity of the present Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath and fooled various persons to deposit the money in the account indicated on two websites which were being run by him.
Essentially, the prosecution has alleged that Sharma formed two websites wherein he had shown himself to be an international Hindu Leader (Yogi Sena Pramukh). Allegedly, he used to take money from the public at large and used the said amount for his own use.
 However, before the Court, his counsel argued that he is absolutely innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case. It was further stated Sharma had undertaken several social assignments and even organized several camps regarding blood donation etc. 
It was also submitted before the Court that he shall not use the websites in the future as they have already been closed by the Investigating Agency and that he shall not use the said account in the future either. 
On the other hand, the A.G.A. opposed the bail application on the ground that the said account and the websites were being used even after the arrest of the applicant and that an amount of Rs. 250/- had been deposited in the account in the month of January 2022. 
However, the Court found it to be a fit case for the grant of bail on his furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 1 Lakh and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned.
It may be noted that as per a news report published by News18 Hindi, in July 2021, the bail application of Sharma, who is also an accused in the case of extorting money by forming a Yogi Sena in the name of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, had been rejected by the Gangster Court in Lucknow.

The Supreme Court has observed that the failure of accused to discharge burden under Section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872 is not relevant in a case governed by circumstantial evidence if the prosecution is unable to establish a chain of circumstance.

The Supreme Court has observed that the failure of accused to discharge burden under Section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872 is not relevant in a case governed by circumstantial evidence if the prosecution is unable to establish a chain of circumstance.
 "When a case is resting on circumstantial evidence, if the accused fails to offer a reasonable explanation in discharge of burden placed on him by virtue of Section 106 of the Evidence Act, such a failure may provide an additional link to the chain of circumstances. In a case governed by circumstantial evidence, if the chain of circumstances which is required to be established by the prosecution is not established, the failure of the accused to discharge the burden under Section 106 of the Evidence Act is not relevant at all. When the chain is not complete, the falsity of the defence is no ground to convict the accused," the bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S Oka remarked.
Section 106 of the Evidence Act states that the burden of proving things within the special knowledge of a person is on that person.
106. Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge - When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.
 The prosecution case is as follows:
 Nagendra Sha's(appellant in the present case) wife died due to burn injuries on November 18, 2011 and based on an information furnished by Mahesh Sah, a case of unnatural death was registered. However, since the cause of death after conducting an autopsy was "asphyxia due to pressure around neck by hand and blunt substance", an FIR was registered against the appellant under section 302 of IPC. When the case was committed to the Court of Sessions, a charge under Section 201 was also added and thereafter charges under Sections 302 and 201 were framed against the appellant.
 Sah was convicted under Sections 302 and 201 by the trial court and was sentenced to life imprisonment and fine of Rs 5,000 for offence u/s 302 and rigorous imprisonment for 3 years and fine of Rs 5000 for offence u/s 201. Both the sentences had to run concurrently and upon default in payment of either fine, the Trial Court directed Sah to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months.
 Aggrieved by the Trial Court's verdict, Sha had preferred an appeal before Patna High Court which was dismissed on April 22, 2019. Sah thereafter approached the Top Court assailing the lower court verdicts.
 Submissions of Counsels 
 The appellant's counsel submitted that none of the witnesses except the official witnesses had supported the prosecution's case and that his conviction was based solely on the cause of death mentioned in the post mortem report. Relying on the Apex Court judgement in Balaji Gunthu Dhule v State of Maharashtra (2012) 11 SCC 685, the counsel further submitted that except for the post mortem report the lower courts did not rely on any other material for convicting him.
 It was also his contention that a complete chain of events establishing his guilt had not been established, since neither the deceased's mother nor Mahesh Sah had supported the prosecution.
 Appearing for the State of Bihar, the counsel submitted that appellant's defence that the deceased died due to burn injuries sustained by accidental fire was completely false based on post mortem report. It was also his contention section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 applied in the case since the deceased and appellant were staying under the same roof and thereafter the burden to explain how the death had occurred was on the appellant.
 State's counsel also contended that the appellant's failure to discharge the burden on him u/s 106 of the Evidence Act was very crucial and that the case was based on circumstantial evidence.
 Court's Observation
 Relying on judgement in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra ((1984) 4 SCC 116), the Court noted that it was not only the appellant who was residing in the house where the incident took place but his parents were also present there and ruled that it could not be said that the established facts did not rule out the existence of any other hypothesis.
 On the applicability of Section 106 of the Evidence Act, the judgment authored by Justice Oka said :
 "Section 106 of the Evidence Act will apply to those cases where the prosecution has succeeded in establishing the facts from which a reasonable inference can be drawn regarding the existence of certain other facts which are within the special knowledge of the accused. When the accused fails to offer proper explanation about the existence of said other facts, the Court can always draw an appropriate inference."
 The bench while acquitting the accused of charges u/s 302 and 201 of IPC and setting aside the High Court's order dated April 22, 2019 observed that,
 "The circumstances established by the prosecution do not lead to only one possible inference regarding the guilt of the appellant-accused."

The Gujarat High Court recently directed the Director General of Police, Gujarat State to ensure that all the police stations in the state have a panel of lawyers to aid the victims of the sexual assault crimes in accordance with the directions issued by the Supreme Court in a 1995 decision.
The Bench of Justice Sonia Gokani and Justice Aniruddha P. Mayee issued this order after noting that the Supreme Court had issued, inter alia, the following 4 directions in Delhi Domestic Working Women's Forum vs. Union of India [(1995) 1 SCC 14], and which are not being followed in the state of Gujarat
The complainants of sexual assault cases should be provided with legal representation. It is important to have someone who is well-acquainted with the criminal justice system. The role of the victim's advocate would not only be to explain to the victim the nature of the proceedings, to prepare her for the case and to assist her in the police station and in court but to provide her with guidance as to how she might obtain help of a different nature from other agencies, for example, mind counseling or medical assistance. It is important to secure continuity of assistance by ensuring that the same person who looked after the complainant's interests in the police station represent her till the end of the case. Legal assistance will have to be provided at the police station since the victim of sexual assault might very well be in a distressed state upon arrival at the police station, the guidance and support of a lawyer at this stage and whilst she was being questioned would be of great assistance to her. The police should be under a duty to inform the victim of her right to representation before any questions were asked of her and that the police report should state that the victim was so informed. A list of advocates willing to act in these cases should be kept at the police station for victims who did not have a particular lawyer in mind or whose own lawyer was unavailable. 
In view of these directions, noting that there is no list of empaneled advocates in the police stations, the Court directed the Director-General of Police to issue necessary circular/direction/notification for every police station of the State to maintain a list of such empaneled lawyers as per the directions issued by the SC in the year 1995.
The Court has also called for an affidavit to be filed before this Court of due implementation of the directions by the Director-General of Police after six weeks.
The background of the case
Essentially, the Bench was dealing with a Habeas Corpus plea filed by the family of a minor girl who was allegedly abducted and thereafter, sexually exploited. After she was rescued, she was found to be 10 weeks pregnant, and therefore, the Court, after holding a consultation with the victim and her family, issued an order to terminate the fetus.
The Court had issued the order after noting that she is extremely young and is a victim of rape and victim under the POCSO Act, therefore, the Court had deemed it appropriate to consider the request for the termination of her pregnancy.
Thereafter, after the termination, she was brought to the Court on February 17, when the Court ordered the Investigating Officer as well as the Full Time Secretary, District Legal Services Authority to ensure periodical counseling of the victim at the end of the experts.
Further, when the court inquired from the investigating officer about the legal assistance for the victim, she pleaded her ignorance, therefore, referring to Supreme Court's 1995 Directions, the Court ordered the DGP to ensure that lawyers' panel is formed in all the police stations of the State.
In relation to the appointment of the advocate in the instance case, the Full Time Secretary, District Legal Services Authority, Mehsana was asked to act expeditiously and report to the Court. With this, the petition was disposed of.

The Rajasthan High Court has observed that the basic object of the Rajasthan Rent Control Act, 1950 is to save the harassment of tenants from unscrupulous landlords. The court added that the said object may not be misconstrued to deprive the landlords of their bona fide properties for all times to come.
Justice Sudesh Bansal observed,
"It may be noticed that the rent control legislation was entitled to strike a reasonable balance between the landlord and tenant. At one hand where the tenant requires adequate protection against his eviction at the hands of aggressive designed greedy landlord, at the same time rights of landlord also require protection to increase the rent reasonably and to evict tenant on the grounds permissible in law. The basic object of the Rent Control Act, 1950 is to save the harassment of tenant from unscrupulous landlords. The object of the Rent Control Act, 1950 may not be misconstrued to deprive the landlords of their bona fide properties for all times to come."
While observing that the rented premise in the instant case was in tenancy of the tenant since 1948, the court granted three months' time to the appellant-tenant to vacate and hand over the rented premise to respondents, subject to payment of due arrears of rent/mesne profits, if any. 
The court opined,
"It has also said that as a whole second appeal under Section 100 CPC it is not permissible for the High Court to re-appreciate evidence on record and interfere with the findings recorded by the courts below and/or the first appellate court. If the first appellate court has exercised its discretion in a judicial manner, its decision cannot be recorded as suffered from an error either of law or of procedural require interference in the second appeal. Ordinarily, the High Court should not interfere with the concurrent findings of fact unless the same suffer from grave perversity or based on the inadmissible evidence or have been passed without evidence."
It was also opined by the court that the re-appreciation of evidence by the High Court while exercising the jurisdiction under Section 100 CPC is not permissible, unless and until some perversity in the fact findings recorded by both courts below either based on misreading/non-reading of evidence or based on some inadmissible evidence or passed ignoring evidence on record have been pointed out. The court noted that both fact finding courts have evaluated the evidence produced by parties and observed that though, the defendants-tenant deposited the rent from January, 1983 in the court under Section 19(A) of the Act of 1950, but such deposition has been held as invalid.
Further, the court said that neither tenant could prove that before deposition of rent in court under Section 19(A) of the Act of 1950, he remitted the due rent from January, 1983 through postal money order to the landlord nor could show that he sent a notice to the landlord asking his bank account details. In such a backdrop of factual matrix, the substantial question of law does not arise at all in the present case and deserves to be answered in negative, added the court.
Thereafter, the court considered the substantial question whether or not the plaintiffs were estopped from filing a suit on ground of default as envisaged under Section 13(1)(a) of the act when there was a practice in between the parties to pay and accept the rent yearly.
In this regard, the court noted that the period of default in the present case is from 01.01.1983 to 30.09.1983. The court also noted that the defendants-tenants never took a defence in their written statement that the rent for the previous years prior to January, 1983 was being paid yearly. The court added that in evidence also, the defendants-tenants never put a suggestive question to the plaintiff-landlord that rent was being paid yearly prior to 1983 and not on a monthly basis. Thus, this substantial question of law is based on the factual matrix, which is not available on record and thereby deserves to be answered in negative, added the court.
Background
The rented premises comprising two shops at Ajmer were in the tenancy of the tenant-Mangal Das since 1948 @ Rs.150/- per month. The respondent-plaintiff landlord instituted a civil suit for eviction on 26.11.1983 invoking Section 13 of the Rajasthan Premise (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1950 on the various grounds of default, nuisance, substantial damages and subletting. The landlord pleaded that the tenant has committed default in payment of rent for more than six months and through registered notice, he had asked the tenant to pay the due rent and to vacate the rented shop, however, since the tenant did not respond to the notice, the present suit was filed. 
The tenant admitted his tenancy in the rented shops since 1948, however, denied all the grounds of eviction. In relation to the default, the tenant took a defence that the rent was tendered through money order which was refused by the landlord and thereafter the due rent has been deposited in the court. He contended that the landlord had knowledge about deposition of due rent in the court, however, thereafter he initiated the present eviction suit. Thus, it was contended that the tenant has not committed any default in payment of rent.
Thereafter, the trial court, after thorough examination, refused to extend the benefit of first default to the tenant. Finally, the decree for eviction on the ground of default was passed. In furtherance, the tenant filed the first appeal. The first appellate court re-heard the matter as a whole and after reappreciation of the evidence on record as also considering the proposition of law, concurred with the fact findings on the issue of default recorded by the trial court. Notably, the first appellate court also considered the application under Order 41 Rule 27 CPC to produce additional evidence. The first appeal was also dismissed and hence, this second appeal has been preferred.
Adv. Ajay Singh with Adv. Deepa Choudhary appeared for the appellants while Adv. Aditya Jain with Adv. Bhavya Golecha appeared for the respondents.
Case Title: Mangal Das through LRS v. Amar Singh through LRS

The Kerala High Court on Tuesday held that while considering bail applications related to offences under the POCSO Act that involve allegations of child abuse by a parent, courts should approach the matter with great care, especially when there is litigation between parents over the custody of the child. 
A single bench of Justice Ziyad Rahman while allowing a bail application filed by a father who was accused of sexually assaulting his 10 year old son cautioned that :
“In such cases, when the materials placed before the court evoke a reasonable suspicion as to the veracity of the allegations, the courts should not hesitate to invoke the powers under section 438 of the Cr.P.C. What is at stake is someone’s personal liberty, integrity, dignity and sometimes, the life itself. The power under section 438 is an important tool for the court to protect the personal liberty of the persons, which is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India” 
Referring to the decision of the court in Suhara and Others v. Muhammed Jaleel the court pointed out that there were increasing number of false cases filed against the biological father by misusing the POSCO Act, and such cases must be handled with caution by Family Courts when there is a custody battle between parents for the child. 
Adv. S. Rajeev appearing for the petitioner contended that the petitioner was being falsely accused by his wife in order to deprive him of any interaction with their son. The counsel pointed out that litigation with regard to the dissolution of marriage between the father and mother was pending before the family court. It was also pointed out that various orders were passed by the family court permitting the father to interact with the child, but the mother had not complied with the same. Proceedings in connection with the violation of said orders were also pending before the family court. Public Prosecutor Sreejith V S however, submitted that granting anticipatory bail would interfere with the progress of investigation. 
The allegation in this case was that the father while interacting with the child under orders of the family court, showed him nude photographs of the victim from when he was small. He also allegedly touched the victim’s private parts with sexual intent while interacting with the child. The court analysed the orders of the family court to note that as per the said orders the interactions of father with the son were smooth and no allegations had been raised by the mother at the time. 
The court also observed that when the child was referred to a counsellor by the family court, no such revelation of sexual assault was made by the victim and if that had been the case, the counsellor would not have recommended that the child be allowed to interact with his father more. 
The court expressed its doubt on the veracity of the allegations against the petitioner and observed: 
“The impression that could be gathered from the sequence of events referred to above compels this court to take the view that an order to protect the personal liberty of the petitioner is absolutely necessary. This Court cannot ignore the trauma, loss of dignity and other difficulties which the petitioner, who is an educated person without any criminal antecedents, has to face if he is compelled to undergo detention based on allegations which are under the shadow of a doubt. If it is ultimately turned out that the allegations are false, nobody can compensate for the loss that may occur to a person due to such detention. “ 
However, the court made it clear that the accused was to surrender before the investigating officer and cooperate with the investigation and imposed bail conditions accordingly.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that when a draft assessment order/show cause notice is issued to an assessee, reasonable time ought to be furnished to respond to the notice, so as to comply with the principles of natural justice.
Observing thus, a bench comprising Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa and Justice Pankaj Jain set aside the re-assessment order passed by the respondent authorities under Section 147 read with Section 144-B of the Income Tax Act 1961 on the very next day.
Significantly, the draft assessment order/show cause notice was issued on March 30 at 8pm and the assessee was called upon to furnish a reply on the same date itself i.e. by March 30, 11.59 PM. Further, the final order was passed on the next day, i.e., March 31.
The Court however granted liberty to the respondents to proceed afresh in the matter regarding framing of the re-assessment order de novo from the stage of issuance of the draft assessment order/show cause notice and to conclude proceedings within a period of four months after affording due and adequate opportunity to the assessee.
 Court further observed that the assessee ought to have been given a reasonable time to respond to the draft assessment order/show cause notice so as to comply with the principles of natural justice in consonance with a fair and transparent procedure.
 There would be no gainsaying the assessee ought to have been furnished a reasonable time to respond to the draft assessment order/show cause notice so as to comply with the principles of natural justice. The same would also be consonance with a fair and transparent procedure.
 After considering submissions of the parties in the light of the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the court concluded that the impugned reassessment order has been set aside on the ground that due opportunity had not been afforded to the assessee to respond to the draft assessment order/show cause notice.

The Supreme Court held that Section 54(3) of the Central Goods and Services Act excludes unutilised input tax credit that accumulated on account of input services.
When there is neither a constitutional guarantee nor a statutory entitlement to refund, the submission that goods and services must necessarily be treated at par on a matter of a refund of unutilized ITC cannot be accepted, the court observed while rejecting the challenge against Section 54(3) on the ground that it violates equality doctrine under Article 14 of the Constitution.
The bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah set aside the Gujarat High Court judgment which held that Rule 89(5) of Central Goods and Service Tax Rules, 2017, by restricting the refund only to input goods, had acted ultra vires Section 54(3) of the CGST Act. It approved a Madras High Court judgment which upheld the Rule.
GST Act and Rules On Refund
Section 54 of the CGST Act provides for 'refund of tax'.
 Sub-Section (3) reads: Subject to the provisions of sub-section (10), a registered person may claim refund of any unutilised input tax credit at the end of any tax period 
Proviso to this sub-section states that no refund of unutilized input tax credit shall be allowed in cases other than- (i) zero rated supplies made without payment of tax; (ii) where the credit has accumulated on account of rate of tax on inputs being higher than the rate of tax on output supplies (other than nil rated or fully exempt supplies), except supplies of goods and services or both may be notified by the Government on the recommendations of the Council. 
There are two more provisos: Provided further that no refund of unutilized input tax credit shall be allowed in cases where the goods exported out of India are subjected to export duty ; Provided also that no refund of input tax credit shall be allowed, if the supplier of goods or services or both avails of drawback in respect of central tax or claims refund of the integrated tax paid on such supplies.
Rule 89(5) provides a formula for the refund of Input Tax Credit, in "a case of refund on account of inverted duty structure" . Explanation (a) to this rule provides that Net ITC shall mean input tax credit availed on inputs during the relevant period other than the input tax credit availed for which refund is claimed under subrules 4(A) or (4B) or both.
Contention of Petitioners
The petitioners before the High Courts had contended that Section 54(3) allows for a refund of ITC originating in inputs as well as input services, Rule 89(5) is ultra vires in so far as it excludes tax on input services from the purview of the formula. They further contended that if Section 54(3) is interpreted as a restriction against a claim for refund of accumulated ITC by confining it only to tax on inputs, it would be unconstitutional as it would lead to discrimination between inputs and input services. According to them, clause (ii) of the first proviso prescribes acondition of eligibility and not a restriction on the entitlement to refund
Divergent Views Of Gujarat and Madras High Courts
The Gujarat High Court in VKC Footsteps India Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India held that "Explanation (a) to Rule 89(5) which denies the refund of "unutilised input tax" paid on "input services" as part of "input tax credit" accumulated on account of inverted duty structure is ultra vires the provision of Section 54(3) of the CGST Act, 2017. The court observed:
(1) The provisions of Sub-section 3 of Section 54 of the CGST Act,2017 which provides for claim of refund of "any unutilised input tax credit". 
(2) The word "Input tax credit" is defined in Section 2(63) means the credit of input tax. The word "input tax" is defined in Section 2(62), whereas the word "input" is defined in Section 2(59) means any goods other than capital goods and "input service" as per Section 2(60) means any service used or intended to be used by a supplier. Whereas "input tax" as defined in section 2(62) means the tax charged on any supply of goods or services or both made to any registered person. Thus "input" and "input service" are both part of the "input tax" and "input tax credit".
(3) As per provision of sub-section 3 of Section 54 of the CGST Act,2017, the legislature has provided that registered person may claim refund of "any unutilised input tax", therefore, by way of Rule 89(5)of the CGST Rules,2017, such claim of the refund cannot be restricted only to "input" excluding the "input services" from the purview of "Input tax credit". 
(4) Clause (ii) of proviso to Sub-section 3 of Section 54 also refers to both supply of goods or services and not only supply of goods 
In Tvl. Transtonnelstroy Afcons Joint Venture v. Union of India, the Madras High Court dismissed the challenge and held that the extension of the benefit of refund only to the unutilised credit that accumulates on account of the rate of tax on input goods being higher than the rate of tax on output supplies by excluding unutilised input tax credit that accumulated on account of input services is a valid classification and a valid exercise of legislative power. 
(1) The definition of 'input' expressly excludes capital goods, whereas if the common parlance meaning is adopted, capital goods would be included and one would be drawing conclusions that are antithetical to the text.
(2) The immediate context, namely, Section 54 contains more than a few usages of the terms "inputs" and "input services" in other sub-sections. By way of illustration, reference may be made to Section 54(8)(a) which uses the words "inputs" and "input services" separately and distinctively in the context of refund of tax paid to exporters. Similarly, the Explanation to Section 54 uses the terms "inputs" and "input services" separately and distinctively, thereby indicating the legislative intent to distinguish one from the other.
(3) Rule 89(5) provides a formula for the refund of Input Tax Credit, in "a case of refund on account of inverted duty structure" .The revised formula inter alia excludes 'input services' from the scope of 'Net ITC' for computation of the refund amount under the said Rule. Rule 89(5) of the CGST Rules denies refund on the unutilised ITC availed on input services and allows relief of refund of ITC availed on input goods alone
Interpretation Of Inputs
The crux of the dispute in the present case pertained to how sub-Section (3) to Section 54 and Explanation 1 to sub-Section (1) of Section 54 are to be understood and interpreted, the court observed. 
The opening sentence of Section 54(3) provides for (i) a claim of refund by a registered person; (ii) of any unutilized input tax credit; (iii) at the end of any tax period. But the impact of the first proviso, as its opening words indicate, is that : 
"No refund" of unutilized ITC "shall be allowed" "in cases other than" (i) and (ii);The expression "claim" in the substantive part must be distinguished from the phrase "shall be allowed" in the opening sentence of the first proviso. Likewise, the expression "may claim refund" in the opening part must be distinguished from "no refund" in the opening part of the first proviso;The impact of the first proviso is that a refund of unutilized ITC shall be allowed only in cases falling under (i) and (ii). The expression 'only' in the previous sentence is not a judicial addition to statutory language but follows plainly from the expressions "no refund" of unutilized ITC shall be allowed "in cases other than"; The expression "in cases other than" is a clear indicator that clauses (i) and (ii) are restrictive and not conditions of eligibility. A refund, in other words, can be allowed in the two contingencies spelt out in clauses (i) and (ii) of the first proviso;  There is a clear distinction between clause (i) and clause (ii) of the first proviso: (a) in the case of exports, the contingency is zero-rated supplies without any distinction between input goods or input services; (b) in contrast for domestic supplies, clause (ii) relates to the accumulation of credit on account of rate of tax on inputs being higher than the rate of tax on output supplies;  The legislative draftsperson has made a clear distinction between clause (i) and clause (ii) of the first proviso and it was in this context that the opening words of Section 54(3) have used the expression "may claim refund of any unutilized ITC";  Explanation 1 to Section 54, while defining the expression "refund" for the purposes of the section adopts an inclusive definition covering (a) refund of tax paid on zero rated supplies of goods or services or both; (b) refund of tax paid on input goods or inputs services used in making such zerorated supplies; (c) refund of tax on supply of goods regarded as deemed exports; and (d) refund of unutilized ITC as provided under sub-section(3) of Section 54; and Explanation 1 indicates that with reference to exports, the legislature has brought within its fold ITC on input goods and input services. In contrast, in the case of domestic supplies it has contemplated refund of unutilized ITC "as provided under sub-section(3)". The Explanation is a clear indicator that in respect of domestic supplies, it is only unutilized credit which has accumulated on the rate of tax on input goods being higher than the rate of output supplies of which a refund can be allowed. Clause (ii) of the first proviso in other words is a restriction and not a mere condition of eligibility.
On challenge to the constitutional validity of Section 54(3)
Parliament while enacting the provisions of Section 54(3), legislated within the fold of the GST regime to prescribe a refund. While doing so, it has confined the grant of refund in terms of the first proviso to Section 54(3) to the two categories which are governed by clauses (i) and (ii). A claim to refund is governed by statute. There is no constitutional entitlement to seek a refund. Parliament has in clause (i) of the first proviso allowed a refund of the unutilized ITC in the case of zero-rated supplies made without payment of tax. Under clause (ii) of the first proviso, Parliament has envisaged a refund of unutilized ITC, where the credit has accumulated on account of the rate of tax on inputs being higher than the rate of tax on output supplies. When there is neither a constitutional guarantee nor a statutory entitlement to refund, the submission that goods and services must necessarily be treated at par on a matter of a refund of unutilized ITC cannot be accepted. Such an interpretation, if carried to its logical conclusion would involve unforeseen consequences, circumscribing the legislative discretion of Parliament to fashion the rate of tax, concessions and exemptions. If the judiciary were to do so, it would run the risk of encroaching upon legislative choices, and on policy decisions which are the prerogative of the executive. Many of the considerations which underlie these choices are based on complex balances drawn between political, economic and social needs and aspirations and are a result of careful analysis of the data and information regarding the levy of taxes and their collection. That is precisely the reason why courts are averse to entering the area of policy matters on fiscal issues. We are therefore unable to accept the challenge to the constitutional validity of Section 54(3)
Expression 'input' can't be broadened to include 'services'
While the CGST Act defines the expression 'input' in Section 2(59) by bracketing it with goods other than capital goods, it is true that the plural expression 'inputs' has not been specifically defined. But there is no reason why the ordinary principle of construing the plural in the same plane as the singular should not be applied. To construe 'inputs' so as to include both input goods and input services would do violence to the provisions of Section 54(3) and would run contrary to the terms of Explanation-I which have been noted earlier. Consequently, it is not open to the Court to accept the argument of the assessee that in the process of construing Section 54(3) contextually, the Court should broaden the expression 'inputs' to cover both goods and services

The Delhi High Court has dismissed a public interest litigation which had sought setting up of a regulatory authority or censor board to review and censor the non-film songs and their contents including their lyrics and videos, before their release on internet. The petition had sought immediate ban on all non-film songs with "obscene/vulgar" content. 
A division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad said that there is a clear regulation or regime laid down by the Central Government to regulate the information or content which is available to the general public through various media platforms.
“As far as television is concerned, the Cinematograph Act, 1952, and the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, addresses the issue regarding regulation of content which is being telecasted on these platforms,” the court said. 
The court said directing appointment of a regulatory authority would result in legislation by the court which is not permissible. 
It said that courts cannot mandate a statute or add provisions to a statute as it would amount to legislation “which is not permissible in the constitutional scheme of this country.”
“The role of judiciary is primarily only to test the legality of a statute and not to amend/modify a statute. Setting up of tribunals, authorities, regulators come purely within the domain of legislature and not in the domain of Courts,” the bench said.
Online Platforms
The court noted that the Union of India has brought out the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 laying down a regimen to be followed by every intermediary.
"Rule 3 & 4 of the Ethics Code applies to various intermediaries like Youtube, WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, etc.,. These guidelines regulate the nature of content that should not be hosted by these platforms. These guidelines read with the IT Act also provides for offences in case of violation of the Ethics Code. In addition to offences under the IT Act, the violators can also be booked under the Indian Penal Code. Thus, the grievance of the Petitioner that there is no Regulatory Authority/censor board to censor/review the non-film songs, their lyrics and videos which are made available to the general public through various media platforms like Television, YouTube, etc. has been taken care of by the Ethics Code and the regime framed thereunder," it said.
The court further noted that Section 7 of the Ethics Code states that whenever an intermediary fails to observe these rules, the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 79 of the Act shall not be applicable to such intermediary and the intermediary shall be liable for punishment under any law for the time being in force including the provisions of the Act and the Indian Penal Code. 
"Part III of the Ethics Code applies to publishers of news and current affairs content and publishers of online curated content and other intermediaries which disseminate information on various social media/digital media platforms. This is apart from the guidelines under Rule 3 & 4 of the Ethics Code and is applicable to digital media platforms and OTT platforms. The Government of India has ensured that these platforms, despite not being intermediaries, are also regulated and do not upload content that violates the below-mentioned rules and regulations," it noted.
The court said there there is a clear regulation/regime that has been laid down by the Central Government to regulate the content which is available to the general public through various media platforms and thus contention that that there is no regulatory authority is incorrect

510 law students written to the Chief Justice of India to issue directions for action to be taken against guilty officials involved in the Hathras incident and the ensuing 2.30 am cremation of the victim.
For this purpose, the students have prayed for directions to conduct an inquiry by the Uttar Pradesh Police, Hathras Police and Hathras District Administration by a special investigation team, headed by a retired Supreme Court Judge.
Pointing to the rising statistics of rape cases being reported every year and with no improvement in the conviction rate, the students state that a girl getting raped has become so common, that we only talk about it in a few selected cases when the nature of the crime is such that it shakes the conscience of a person.
While stating that even though the 19-year old girl succumbed to death, she gave a dying statement citing rape and the manner in which her body was treated, the law students state that despite this, the police officials deprived the victims family of bidding farewell to their daughter and restrained them under illegal house arrest.
"...the police officials who are the investigating wing of the justice system and protectors of our society and are responsible by law to register, investigate and frame charges in cognizable cases are now the ones who are depriving the victim and the family of the victim a chance to bid farewell, by burning the victim's body in the middle of the night, in a field, alone with the family under illegal house arrest while restricting other spectators such as the media and villagers to come near the place of burning," the letter reads.
The law students aver that the Criminal Law provisions prescribe rights, duties and responsibilities and procedures based on which the investigating agency conducts itself and its acts, therefore, the police authority is liable for questioning on their act on the night of 30th September, 2020, when they burned the victim's body in the middle of a field by throwing petrol on her and then lighting it on fire.
It is stated that the aforementioned act "took away her right to die with dignity" and that the acts of police officials are not justifiable constitutionally and on the substantive provisions of law.
"Fundamental right of 'Right to life with dignity' which also includes the right to decent cremation in accordance with culture and tradition of the person who is no more," the law students state while citing Parmanand Katra, Advocate v. Union of India (1995) 3 SCC 248.
The students claim that even Ajmal Kasab, a convicted terrorist was given a decent burial but the same humanity was not extended to the Hathras incident victim and her family who've lived all their lives in India and had lost their daughter to what is known as the most hated crime.
"The Hathras police has instilled a fear of authoritarianism in the hearts of us Law Students and concerned citizens and the question that a lot of female law students are asking is whether the police are taking up the role of completing the crime for the criminal and if it is required, whether we can report a crime without questioning the intention and the result of reporting such a crime that we have been a victim of?," the law students question.
Pointing to the Court's intervention in the past in the Unnao Rape Case, Kathua Rape Case and the very recent Hyderabad Rape case, the law students have urged the top court to give a statement, a direction or even an observation in tune with this unfortunate incident.
In this backdrop, the students also pray for directions to all states and UT Governments to utilise funds present in the Nirbhaya Fund towards ensuring safety of women as well as to discuss or issue appropriate guidelines, as the regarding the right of a family on the dead body and the right to die with dignity.
The students also pray for strict implementation of all the steps and initiatives are in force such as Fast track Court.
The letter has been written by Naomi Ting & Zarif Hosain from Symbiosis Law School, Noida and has been signed by law students from law schools across the country.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that a journalist is not expected to dramatize a sensational and horrifying incident and make news by putting his actor in a pitiable condition in danger of death.
 The Bench of Justice Vikas Kunvar Srivastav observed thus while denying bail to a journalist who allegedly tempted a person (since dead) that if he would try to commit suicide in front of the Legislative Assembly building, by making a video of him, he will telecast the same on television.
 Regarding the role of a Journalist, the Court also remarked:
 "The journalist keeps an eye on the anticipated or sudden events happening in the society and brings them to the information of all the people through various news media without any tampering, this is his business."
 The matter before the Court
 The Court was hearing a bail application filed by an accused named Shameem Ahmad, who has been booked under Sections 306/511/109/506/504 of I.P.C.
 He has been accused of inducing a person (deceased) to set himself ablaze into fire just in front of "Vidhan Sabha Bhawan" so that they may film the incident by videography and telecast the same on television.
 Facts in brief
 The landlord of the deceased wanted him to vacate the house, and on October 19, 2020, he came to the house of the deceased and started abusing her husband in filthy language and asked him to vacate the house. 
 When the deceased told him his being in financial trouble and inability to vacate the house, the landlord scoldingly asked him to set himself ablazed and die, if he is not able to vacate the accommodation. 
 Thereafter, the Accused Journalist asked him to set himself ablaze and promised him to cover the incident. Further, he told the deceased that if it happens, the matter, so as planned would get highlighted and no one would force him to evict him from his house.
 Allegedly, under the aforesaid inducement, given by the accused, the co-accused brought the deceased in front of "Vidhan Sabha Bhawan", where he, as induced and planned, poured oil on him and lit the fire and the accused journalists were making video of the incident. 
 The policemen present there, ran to save him by covering him with a blanket and took him to a hospital where he subsequently died on October 24, 2020.
 Court's observations
 Taking into account the video camera and film recovered from the accused, evidence of the independent witness, and the C.C.T.V. of Vidhansabha, the Court noted that instead of saving the grievously burning deceased, the accused kept on filming it till he was badly scorched. 
 Therefore, the Court observed that the case of the prosecution against the accused was prima facie established that he told the deceased, living in mental and financial distress, to the temptation and plan to get rid of them. 
 The Court further noted that he was present with the deceased at the scene of the incident and filming it and therefore, the claim of his innocence by the accused was prima facie not established.
 Importantly, the Court said:
 "The complainant (wife of the deceased), who is already mentally distressed by her husband's financial condition, who further committed suicide under the influence of the accused, if the accused is made free, she would be in danger. She is the main witness in the case. For fair trial, the complainant would need a completely fear-free environment as a witness. She has the right to have a fair trial of the matter."
 Thus, the application of the bail moved on behalf of accused-applicant was rejected.

The Bombay High Court has read down rule for Maharashtra quota reservation with respect to admission in 5-year law program in the State for candidates who are born/ domiciled in Maharashtra but who could not complete their 10th/ 12th from the State on account of their parent's army posting.
"Rules are not ultra vires, however, we may hasten to add that same needs to be read down to provide relaxation or exemption for those candidates who are born in Maharashtra and whose parents are domicile of Maharashtra but due to fortuitous circumstances such as the parent is in service of the Government and serving the nation and due to service condition is deployed in various parts of the country could not complete their SSC or HSC from State of Maharashtra", the court held.
Justices S.V. Gangapurwala and Madhav J. Jamdar were dealing with a writ petition challenging the eligibility criteria for availing admission through Maharashtra quota in 5-year integrated law course.
The petitioners are wards of an Army Officer. Petitioners were born in Maharashtra; however, they completed their 10th and 12th standard from Army School in New Delhi. They couldn't study in Maharashtra as their father was posted at various locations outside Maharashtra. 
The state government notified MH-CET Examination for 5 years integrated LLB course. The notification provides for 85% reservation for candidates who, inter alia, pass Class 10th and 12th or equivalent exams from a recognized institution in Maharashtra. The petitioner have challenged this eligibility criteria before the High Court.
Dr. Abhinav Chandrachud for the Petitioners submitted that it is arbitrary and unreasonable that the Petitioners are deprived of equal opportunity of education in their parent State only on account of their father being posted at various locations throughout the country. State has created an unjustified classification violating Article 14 of the Constitution. Petitioners had to take 10th and 12th standard from outside Maharashtra due to fortuitous circumstances.
Advocate Sameer Khedekar for the State Common Entrance Test Cell submitted that the Rule is not discriminatory or arbitrary. Preference based on domicile or institution is allowed within reasonable limits i.e., it does not result in reservation of more than 85% seats in graduate courses and more than 75% seats in post graduate courses.
The court perused the Rules of admission and concluded that the primary criteria for candidature under Maharashtra State quota is that the candidate should have passed 10th and 12th standard examination from the institution located within Maharashtra.
The court stated that the condition of passing 10th and 12th standard from Maharashtra may not be unreasonable or arbitrary, however, further distinction will have to be made as there may be cases where the candidate does not have a choice, such as the service conditions of the parents due to which they are posted throughout the country in the service of the nation. 
"In such cases, relaxation can be provided by the State Government to such candidates of not completing SSC and HSC from the State of Maharashtra. If such exception or relaxation is not provided, the same would be harsh and would be disentitling the candidates domiciled in Maharashtra or born in Maharashtra from taking benefit of Maharashtra State quota", the court observed.
The court noted that an exception is provided to students who are not domiciled in Maharashtra but have completed 10th and 12th from Maharashtra and their parents have been transferred to the state by Government of India just before last date on submitting the form. However, students who are domiciled in Maharashtra but didn't complete class 10th and 12th in Maharashtra due to parents posted elsewhere by the Government of India are precluded from availing the Maharashtra State quota. "The same would be unreasonable", the court held.

Case title – Priya Kedar Gokhale and Anr. v. State of Maharashtra and Ors.
Coram – Justice S.V. Gangapurwala and Justice Madhav J. Jamdar

The Supreme Court on Thursday affirmed the death penalty awarded to Lakshar-e-Toiba militant Mohammed Arif for the 2000 Red Fort Attack case which resulted in the death of three persons including two army officers. The Court dismissed the review petition filed by him challenging his conviction and sentence.
When there is challenge to the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India by acts of terrorism, such acts are taken as the most aggravating circumstances, the bench comprising Chief Justice UU Lalit, Justice S Ravindra Bhat and Justice Bela M Trivedi observed. The court added that this factor completely outweigh the factors which may even remotely be brought into consideration as mitigating circumstances on record.
Background
On 22.12.2000 some intruders started indiscriminate firing and gunned down three persons including two army Jawans belonging to 7th Rajputana Rifles. Mohd. Arif, admittedly a Pakistani national, was arrested on December 25, 2000 in this case. He was convicted by the trial court on October 24, 2005, and awarded death sentence on October 31, 2005. His death sentence was confirmed by the Delhi High Court by an order dated September 13, 2007.
The apex court dismissed his appeal challenging the conviction on August 10, 2011, and his review petition was dismissed on August 28, 2011. Upholding the High Court's confirmation of Death Sentence Supreme Court by its earlier order had observed– "It was an attack on Mother India. This is apart from the fact that as many as three persons had lost their lives. The conspirators had no place in India. Appellant was a foreign national and had entered India without any authorization or even justification. This is apart from the fact that the appellant built up a conspiracy by practicing deceit and committing various other offences in furtherance of the conspiracy to wage war against India as also to commit murders by launching an unprovoked attack on the soldiers of Indian Army. We, therefore, have no doubts that death sentence was the only sentence in the peculiar circumstance of this case."
However, in 2016, the Supreme Court decided to re-hear his review petition based after the verdict which held that review petitions filed in death sentence cases must be heard in open court. The apex court on April 28, 2014 had stayed Arif's execution in the case.
Grounds in Review Petition
The following grounds were raised in the review petition:
(a) The concerned Courts committed error in allowing call records to be admitted in evidence, in the absence of an appropriate certificate under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
(b) The disclosure statements of the review petitioner must be taken to be inadmissible on account of illtreatment meted out to him during the intervening night between his actual arrest and his formal arrest. 
(c) The recovery of ammunition or the encounter of one Abu Shamal, who was stated to be the accomplice of the petitioner, at Batla House, New Delhi, could not be associated with the disclosure statement of the review petitioner. 
(d) Any possibility of retribution and rehabilitation of the review petitioner, or that he would continue to be a threat to the society, was not considered by the Courts.
 Anvar P.V. as clarified in Arjun Panditrao is the law declared on Section 65B of the Evidence Act
The bench observed that the decision in Anvar P.V. as clarified in Arjun Panditrao is the law declared on Section 65B of the Evidence Act. In Anvar, it was held that in the case of CD, VCD, chip, etc., the same shall be accompanied by the certificate in terms of Section 65-B obtained at the time of taking the document, without which, the secondary evidence pertaining to that electronic record, is inadmissible. Approving this view, the court in Arjun Panditrao clarified that certificate under Section 65-B(4) is unnecessary if the original document itself is produced. The court therefore observed:
Consequently, we must eschew, for the present purposes, the electronic evidence in the form of CDRs which was without any appropriate certificate under Section 65-B(4) of the Evidence Act...even after eschewing circumstances 'h' and 'j' which were directly attributable to the CDRs relied upon by the prosecution, the other circumstances on record do clearly spell out and prove beyond any doubt the involvement of the review petitioner in the crime in question
Direct attack on the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India
One of the grounds taken in the review petition was that the possibility of retribution and rehabilitation of the convict, or that he would continue to be a threat to the society, was not considered by the Courts while awarding/confirming the death sentence. The Centre submitted that the cases involving acts of terror which challenge the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India can only be adequately compensated by awarding the death sentence.
"There is nothing on record which can be taken to be a mitigating circumstance in favour of the review petitioner. The suggestion that there is a possibility of retribution and rehabilitation, is not made out from and supported by any material on record. On the other hand, the aggravating circumstances evident from the record and specially the fact that there was a direct attack on the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India, completely outweigh the factors which may even remotely be brought into consideration as mitigating circumstances on record.", the court observed.

The Karnataka High Court has quashed the proceedings pending under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, against two officials of a logistics company on holding that they were unaware that the driver of the transport vehicle is carrying contraband.
 A single judge bench of Justice P N Desai sitting at Kalaburagi allowed the petition filed by the Manager and MD of Nitco Logistic Pvt Ltd.
 The bench said, "The charge sheet materials, allegations against these petitioners, the statement of the driver, the contents of the panchnama and Sections referred above, it is evident that these petitioners cannot be prosecuted as they have nothing to do with the said alleged offences. Therefore, continuing the proceedings against them is nothing but abuse of process of law and Court."
 On receiving secret information, the Excise Inspector intercepted the company's shipment vehicle and found contraband (500 grams poppy straw powder) in fertiliser bags, behind the driver's seat. The accused were arrested and said powder and vehicle were seized. The police registered the complaint and after completing investigation, filed a charge sheet against the driver as well as the Petitioners herein.
At the outset, the bench noted that there is nothing to show that these petitioners either knew the owners of the said logistic or they had knowingly permitted driver to transport such contraband substance. It observed,
 "When the accused No.1 - driver himself stated that owners of the vehicle or owners of the goods were not knowing that he is transporting the said contraband substance, the question of prosecuting these petitioners does not arise at all."
The Petitioners had argued that goods loaded in the vehicle were all as per the supporting invoices and nothing was recovered from the shipment container, which is locked after loading and is opened only at the place of unloading by giving one time lock password. The contraband was recovered from the driver's cabin and they had no knowledge of the same.
The State on the other hand contended that whether the petitioners were having knowledge or not, is to be proved at the time of trial, not at this stage.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently observed that the security of work should, as far as possible, be assured to the employee so that he may contribute the maximum efforts for the development.
 Justice Moksha Kazmi Khajuria observed,
 "Government in particular should not allow workers to remain as temporary employees for an unreasonable long period of time; this kind of exploitation of decades makes a temporary employee suffer to the great extent."
 The observations were made while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had sought direction upon the respondent J&K Board of School Education to regularize services of the petitioners against the Class-IV posts, as has been adopted in the case of other similarly placed Consolidated Workers.
 Taking recourse to the available record the bench noted that the petitioners had been appointed as Consolidated Workers in the respondent-Board initially for a period specified in the order. The said terms of engagement was extended from time to time.
 The court further noted that as per the policy decision taken by the respondent Board, an employee engaged on daily rated/Consolidated Worker, after completion of seven years of service, is entitled to regularization against class IV post and accordingly the respondents had from time to time, regularized the services of various Consolidated Workers, thereby, implementing the Policy decision taken by the Board in this behalf.
 However in the case of petitioner, the bench noted that despite making various representations the same had been ignored by the respondents without any plausible reasons, meaning thereby that the respondents have implemented the policy decision only in respect of their favorites in total disregard of the fact that the petitioners were appointed much prior to the Consolidated Workers, who have been regularized by the respondent Board.
 In order to address the contentions of the petitioners in an appropriate manner and as per law on the subject the bench found it worthwhile to record the observations of Supreme Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka and Ors Vs. Umadevi and Ors:
 "There may be cases where irregular appointments (not illegal appointments) of duly qualified persons in duly sanctioned vacant posts might have been made and the employees have continued to work for ten years or more but without the intervention of orders of courts or of tribunals. The question of regularization of the services of such employees may have to be considered on merits in the light of the principles settled by this Court in the cases above referred to and in the light of this judgment. In that context, the Union of India, the State Governments and their instrumentalities should take steps to regularize as a one time measure, the services of such irregularly appointed, who have worked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts but not under cover of orders of courts or of tribunals and should further ensure that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in cases where temporary employees or daily wagers are being now employed. "
 In view of the above discussion and following the apex court precedent on the subject the bench allowed writ petition and directed the Competent Authority to consider the claim of the petitioners in light of the resolution passed by the Board of Governors as also various recommendations made in favour of the petitioners in the same manner as has been done in case of four similarly placed Consolidated Workers.
 The respondent J&K State Board of School Education is further directed to pass a speaking order within a period of two months from the date copy of this Judgment is made available to the respondents, the bench concluded.
 Case Title : Showkat Ahmad Najar & Ors Vs UT of J&K & Ors. 

The Gujarat High Court has refused to cancel the anticipatory bail granted to a rape accused five years ago, stating that all this time the applicant-victim did not take a stand that seriousness of offence has not been considered by the Court below and that the accused has not misused his liberty nor violated any condition.The accused was booked for offences punishable under Sections 376,...
The Gujarat High Court has refused to cancel the anticipatory bail granted to a rape accused five years ago, stating that all this time the applicant-victim did not take a stand that seriousness of offence has not been considered by the Court below and that the accused has not misused his liberty nor violated any condition.
The accused was booked for offences punishable under Sections 376, 366, 328, 395, 397, 344, 406, 420, 506(2) and 120(B) of the Indian Penal Code.
 The Bench comprising Justice Ashutosh Shastri opined that the trial had already begun and it would be improper to cancel anticipatory bail granted 5 years before, particularly, when no attempt was made by the Applicant to get the matter disposed of at the earliest who had approached the Court after a lapse of time.
 The facts of the case were that the victim aged 19 years old had gone to attend nature's call at night in 2017 but did not return. Subsequent to the search, it was found that Respondent No. 2 had abducted the victim for the purpose of marriage. It was also discovered that the Respondent Accused and other persons had forcefully taken the victim in a white car and administered threats against raising alarm. She was also made unconsciousness and upon waking, she realised that she had been subjected to sexual intercourse against her will. The Respondent also got signatures on certain papers and thereafter, she was shifted to Naroda and confined to a house. However, the victim had managed to escape custody, albeit without ornaments or her mobile phone. 
 Respondent No. 2, thereafter, filed a Habeas Corpus Petition and an anticipatory bail application which was granted in September 2017 by the Sessions Judge which was challenged in the instant petition.
 The Applicant insisted that a serious offence under Sec 376 was committed which was not appreciated by the Sessions Judge while granting bail. It was also claimed that the impugned order was passed without much discussion and the reasons assigned by the Judge for granting bail were not 'germane to law.' However, the Applicant admitted that the trial had already commenced and left it to the discretion of the High Court to pass the necessary order.
 Per contra, Respondent 2 contested that the application could not be entertained at the given stage of trial. Further, Respondent had not violated any bail conditions. It was also averred that the victim was aged 19 years and there was not enough material on record to justify that force was administered. 
 Justice Shastri primarily opined that bail was granted in 2017 and there were 'no special circumstances placed before the Court to set aside the same.' The Court also noted that the age of the victim was 19 years age at the time of the incident and there was a statement attributed to the victim that she had gone with the Respondent out of her own volition. Later, 'love marriage' was executed but since the Respondent was not earning and misbehaving with her, she chose not to reside with him.
 Reliance was placed on X vs State of Telangana and Anr to emphasise: "Very cogent and overwhelming circumstances are necessary for an order directing the cancellation of the bail, already granted."
 Accordingly, the application was dismissed.
 Case No: R/CR.MA/25080/2017
 Case Title: RAJUBHAI KAMABHAI DESAI v/s STATE OF GUJARAT & 1 other(s)

The Karnataka High Court has said that courts are bound to take into consideration all the contentions raised by the parties while hearing a bail petition filed before it and then pass an appropriate order.
 A single judge bench of Justice Mohammad Nawaz while granting bail to Nelson Raj and three other accused said, 
"When a bail petition is filed, the Court is bound to take into consideration all the contentions raised and pass an appropriate order. It is necessary to look into the material on record which prima facie connects the accused with the crime and adverting to those materials, Court can come to the conclusion as to whether a prima facie case has been made out or not and shall assign reasons for either allowing or rejecting a bail petition."
 Case Details:
 The accused were charged under Sections 302, 120B and 149 of IPC and Section 3(2)(v) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The complaint was lodged by one Lakshmamma, mother of deceased Harish. It was alleged that her son was murdered by one Rakshith and his associates by assaulting him with deadly weapons.
 The appellants preferred a petition under Section 439 of CrPC before the Special Court, praying to enlarge them on bail, which was rejected vide impugned order 25.11.2021.
 Petitioner's submissions:
 It was contended that after the arrest of the accused persons, the alleged eye witnesses namely CWs.3 and 4 did not identify them. Further, there were contradictions in their statements recorded under Section 164 of CrPC. The names of other accused persons except accused No.1 were not in the First Information Report and similarly placed accused No.6 had been enlarged on bail by the Sessions Court.
 Findings:
 The bench said that whereas while deciding the grant of bail, seriousness of the offence, likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice, impact of release of the accused on the prosecution witnesses and likelihood of the accused tampering with evidence are primary considerations, "but, at the same time, the Court has to come to a reasonable conclusion as to whether there is any prima facie or reasonable ground to believe that the accused has committed the offence, followed by the nature and gravity of the charge and severity of the punishment."
 It then opined that certain important factors relating to prima facie involvement of the accused have to be considered, though no detailed discussion regarding merits of the case is required. Where a Court considering an application for bail fails to consider the relevant factors, an appellate Court may justifiably set aside the order.
 "Bail orders either granting or refusing cannot be passed in a mechanical manner or by a cryptic order, without considering the material aspects of the case. Court is duty bound to give reasons for granting or denying bail, especially in cases involving serious offences," it said.
 On going through the order passed by the special court the bench held,
 "The impugned order falls short of such reasoning for dismissing the bail petition. The learned Special Judge has not adverted to the various contentions stated to have been raised by the appellants counsel, except stating that accused are alleged to have committed a brutal murder of deceased and a prima facie case is made out against the accused etc."
 It added, "The Special Judge has failed to advert to the various contentions said to have been raised by the Counsel appearing for the accused before the trial Court. The reasons for rejecting the prayer for bail does not appear to be in accordance with law."
 Accordingly it allowed the appeal and set aside the special court order and remitted the matter back to the trial court directing it to hear the parties concerned afresh and pass orders on the bail application, in accordance with law, as expeditiously as possible.
 Case Title: NELSON RAJ v. THE STATE OF KARNATAKA
 Case No: CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.336 OF 2022 C/W CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.267 OF 2022 & CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.337 OF 2022. 
 Date of Order: 21ST DAY OF JUNE, 2022 
 Appearance: Advocate RAMAKRISHNA SRINIVASAN for appellants; HCGP R.D. RENUKARADHYA, FOR R.1

Taking exception to the “unhealthy pattern” of not filing status reports and affidavits in time, the Delhi High Court has cautioned the government authorities, state departments and corporations that costs would be imposed if the time schedule for pleadings fixed is not adhered to.
Justice Prathiba M Singh observed that usually all the governmental authorities, despite specific directions, are unable to file the affidavits within the specified time schedule and “they choose to do so only within the same just one or two days before the date of hearing.”
“The Court is constrained to observe that there is an unhealthy pattern of governmental authorities, state departments and corporations not filing the Counter Affidavits and Status Reports as per the timelines prescribed by the Court,” Justice Singh said.
The court was hearing a plea moved by Wazirpur Bartan Nirmata Sangh. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) on August 17, 2022 was directed to take further steps to ensure removal of encroachments. 
The court had also directed the MCD to file a further affidavit specifically disclosing whether all encroachments were removed from the road in question and if further steps remained to be taken. The local SHO was also asked to file an affidavit in the matter. 
Noting that neither the MCD nor the concerned SHO filed any affidavit in the matter in time, Justice Singh said that the responses by both the authorities were handed over in court on the date of hearing. 
The court noted that the responses are stated to have been filed on January 26 and 28 itself.
“It is observed that usually all the governmental authorities, despite specific directions, are unable to file the affidavits within the specified time schedule and choose to do so only within the same just one or two days before the date of hearing. It is made clear that costs would be liable to be imposed, if the time schedule for pleadings fixed by the Court, are not adhered to,” the court said. 
The MCD in the response said that after the removal of encroachments, the Assistant Commissioner of Police (North West) was issued a letter to ensure that no further encroachment or illegal construction takes place. 
Observing that the last year’s order clearly directed the MCD and local police to ensure that public roads are made clear of encroachment and illegal structures, the court said:
“It is usually seen that even if the demolition or encroachment removal takes place, the local police does not thereafter, ensure that no fresh encroachments are made. Moreover, the malba in the area is left lying as it is which inconveniences the public.”
Justice Singh said that whenever unauthorised construction and encroachments are removed, cleaning up of the area in question is an obligation of the MCD “which they have to undertake without fail.”
It added that the SHO of the area would also be responsible to ensure that no further unauthorised construction is made out after encroachments are removed.
The court thus directed the Assistant Commissioner, Keshav Puram Zone, MCD along with three to four representatives of the petitioner association and concerned SHO to conduct a joint inspection of the area.
“After the said joint inspection, a joint status report shall be filed. This shall be the last and final opportunity to the Assistant Commissioner, Keshav Puram Zone, MCD, as also to the concerned SHO to ensure that there are no more encroachments in the area failing which the action would be liable to be taken against these officials personally,” the court said. 
The court directed that all the encroachments and illegal constructions be removed and a comprehensive status report be placed “at least one week before the next date of hearing” failing which the concerned Divisional Commissioner and SHO shall remain present. 
The court will hear the matter next on April 10. 
Title: WAZIRPUR BARTAN NIRMATA SANGH (THROUGH ITS SECRETARY) & ORS v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS.

The Gauhati High Court rejected the prayer for interim orders in a plea challenging notification dated 18.08.2022 temporarily suspending mobile internet connectivity during State recruitment examination.
The impugned order was issued by the Principal Secretary to the Government of Assam, Home and Political Department, invoking the power conferred under the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 read with Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. It had mandated that, on 21.08.2022 and 28.08.2022, mobile internet services will remain suspended for 4 hours in 24 districts which had centres of written examination for filling up approximately 30,000 posts for Grade-III and Grade-IV services in different departments in the State. The measure was claimed to have been adopted to facilitate a free, fair and transparent conduct of the examination by curbing mobile phone-enabled cheating.
 The counsel for the petitioner argued that the notification violated the exercise of fundamental rights guaranteed to her client under Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India and that, under the provisions of Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, internet services could not be suspended so as to prevent cheating in the examination halls. She contended that the only recourse in such suspension of this right was in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 19(2) of the Constitution, which, she asserted, had not been followed in the present case.
 Heavily relying on Supreme Court rulings in Anuradha Bhasin Vs. Union of India and People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) vs. Union of India and another, she argued that since temporary suspension of internet services directly infringed upon the fundamental right of her client, this was a fit case for the Court to not only interfere with the impugned notification, but to pass an interim order suspending its operation.
 The Advocate General, Assam submitted that the State had come up with elaborate arrangements on the basis of Standard Operative Procedure to ensure a free, fair and malpractice-free recruitment process and that the temporary suspension of the mobile data services had been adopted only as the last option. 
It was argued that such a measure had to be adopted by the State after putting in place other measures. He pointed out that the government had taken a stringent measure keeping in mind the onslaught of question paper leakages in the few recruitment processes held in the State of Assam over the past several years. He added that it was not technically feasible to selectively suspend mobile data services only in those areas where examination centres were located. He added that broadband and cable enabled internet services would remain uninterrupted. He pointed out that mobile internet services would be suspended on a Sunday afternoon, for a specific period only. 
 The Advocate General also referred to the decision in Anuradha Bhasin, to submit that the recourse adopted by the State was both permissible and justified in the facts and circumstances of the case. He contended that the petition was liable to be dismissed since there was nothing on record to indicate as to whether the petitioner had a mobile phone or if he was using a mobile data service. To this, the counsel for the petitioner responded that the petitioner was personally aggrieved since his mobile services were not working due to suspension of the data card.
 The Court stated that the question as to whether mobile data services could be temporarily suspended to curb cheating would not be possible to examine unless the State files an affidavit bringing its stand, along with documents, on record. To this end, a notice was issued which was accepted by the senior Government Advocate, Assam. 
 The Court stated that the petitioner had failed to make a case on facts in support of his prayer for interim relief. Keeping in mind that the suspension of data services was not to be extended to the examination scheduled to be held on 11.09.2022 and that some disruption may be caused to the conduct of the examination, the Court rejected the prayer for interim orders.
 Case Title : RAJU PROSAD SARMA Vs. STATE OF ASSAM

The Supreme Court, in a judgment delivered on Wednesday, gave a simple and short definition for the term 'sufficient cause' in Section 5 of Limitation Act, 1963.
‘Sufficient Cause’ is the cause for which a party could not be blamed , Justice C T Ravikumar, who authored the judgment, observed.
The Apex Court bench also comprising of Justice Ajay Rastogi was considering an appeal filed against NCLT order dismissing an application seeking initiation of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) on the ground that it is barred by limitation. 
In this case, Sabarmati Gas Limited had filed an application under Section 9 IBC before NCLT, Ahmedabad seeking initiation of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) in its capacity as Operational Creditor of the Shah Alloys Limited. NCLT dismissed the application on the grounds of being barred by limitation and existence of a ‘pre-existing dispute’ between the parties. As the NCLAT dismissed the appeal, Sabarmati Gas Ltd., approached the Apex Court.
One of the issues raised in the appeal was whether in computation of the period of limitation in regard to an application filed under Section 9, IBC the period during which the operational creditor’s right to proceed against or sue the corporate debtor that remain suspended by virtue of Section 22 (1) of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions Act, 1985) (SICA) can be excluded, as provided under Section 22 (5) of SICA?
The court observed that there was a legal bar for initiation of proceedings against an industrial company by virtue of Section 22 (1), SICA.
" Obviously, when a party was thus legally disabled from resorting to legal proceeding for recovering the outstanding dues without the permission of BIFR and even on application permission therefor was not given the period of suspension of legal proceedings is excludable in computing the period of limitation for the enforcement of such right in terms of Section 22(5), SICA. In the absence of provisions for exclusion of such period in respect of an application under Section 9, IBC, despite the combined reading of Section 238A, IBC and the provisions under the Limitation Act what is legally available to such a party is to assign the same as a sufficient cause for condoning the delay under Section 5 of the Limitation Act", the bench said.
In this context, the court referred to Section 5 of the Limitation Act and observed:
"As relates Section 5 of the Limitation Act showing ‘sufficient cause’ is the only criterion for condoning delay. ‘Sufficient Cause’ is the cause for which a party could not be blamed."
[Note: Section 3 of the Limitation Act provides that "Subject to the provisions contained in sections 4 to 24 (inclusive), every suit instituted, appeal preferred, and application made after the prescribed period shall be dismissed, although limitation has not been set up as a defence." Section 5 reads as follows: "Any appeal or any application, other than an application under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), may be admitted after the prescribed period if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period.]
The court said that it is incumbent on the Adjudicating Authority to consider the claim for condonation of the delay when once the proceeding concerned is found filed beyond the period of limitation. On merits, the bench, however, found that appeal is liable to be dismissed as there existed a ‘pre-existing dispute’ between the parties.

The Bombay High Court recently directed the Commissioner of Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) to take a final decision regarding grant of permission for construction of a Floating Hotel (Floatel) anchoring off the Raj Bhavan.
“We further direct that the Commissioner of Municipal Corporation shall take his final decision in the matter in accordance with law within a period of four weeks from the date of his decision having exclusive jurisdiction or receipt of recommendations from the Three Member Committee, as the case may be”, the court said.
The court directed the Commissioner to first decide whether he has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the matter or whether recommendations from the three-member committee formed by the High Court are required. 
The Commissioner has to decide the NOC application within four weeks from the date of his decision regarding jurisdiction and within eight weeks from the date of submission of all relevant papers and representation by the petitioner company.
The division bench of Justice Sunil B. Shukre and Justice M. W. Chandwani also set aside the three-member committee’s 2017 order denying permission to construct the floating hotel and related infrastructure.
The three-member committee was constituted via the High Court’s order on August 6, 2015, in a PIL Vinay Mulchand Yadav v. State of Maharashtra. The MCGM has to permit, prohibit or regulate any activity at Marine Drive depending upon the committee’s recommendation.
The petitioner sought permission to construct a Floating Hotel two nautical miles into the sea. Permission was also sought for construction of a waiting area and floating jetty near the National Centre for Performing Arts. The petitioner said that it will implement the project on the basis of an MoU with MTDC.
The committee consisting of the Chairman of the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee, the Police Commissioner, Mumbai and the MCGM Commissioner denied the permission. Bombay HC in 2018 upheld this decision observing that the infrastructure would be an extension of the Marine Drive Promenade. However, last year, the Apex Court set aside the HC’s decision and sent the matter back for fresh consideration.
In the second round, the court agreed with the petitioner’s contention that none of the proposed structures form part of the Marine Drive Promenade. The court noted that the starting point of the floating jetty does not form part of the promenade and the proposed waiting area is on a piece of land not on the Promenade. Further, the parking area has been allotted by the MMRDA and is not part of the Promenade.
Thus, the court stated that the MCGM Commissioner has to first decide whether he has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the petitioner’s NOC application. “…if he decides that he has such jurisdiction in the matter, he would have to go ahead to consider the application of the petitioner on its own merits, without being influenced by the order passed by this Court and also order passed by the Three Member Committee on 24th May 2017”, the court added. 
However, if the Commissioner concludes that he has no exclusive rejection then he would have to refer the matter to the three-member committee and act on its recommendation, the court said. The recording of finding on jurisdiction is important as it does to the root of the dispute in the case, the court held.
The court also set aside the order of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone-1, rejecting the NOC application. That order was based on the objection by the Senior Police Inspector, Marine Drive Police Station and the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Colaba division. The court said that neither of these authorities have any jurisdiction in the matter and the police authorities having jurisdiction have already given the green signal. 
“The authority which is having jurisdiction in the matter, i.e. Deputy Commissioner of Police, Mumbai had already granted permission for the subject project vide its communication dated 13th April 2011. There is another communication dated 9th June 2016 of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Head Office-1, MCGM granting permission for implementing the Floatel project and carrying out incidental activities. This permission, granted on 9th June 2016, would in particular, nullify the subsequent objection taken by the subordinate officer of the Commissioner of Mumbai Police”, the court held.
Case no. – Writ Petition No. 2591 of 2017
Case Title – Rashmi Developments Pvt. Ltd. v. Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai and Ors.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court (Indore Bench) recently upheld the life sentence awarded to a man for raping a 3-year-old girl. The court noted that the accused had left an indelible mark of devastation on the mind and body of the victim.
The Bench of Justice Satyendra Kumar Singh and Justice Subodh Abhyankar observed that in view of the rights and plight of the victim and her family members, the Life imprisonment awarded to the appellant is by no means severe or excessive.
The facts in brief 
Accused Pappu was convicted for offence punishable under Sections 376(2)(F) of the I.P.C. by the Additional Sessions Judge, Dhar and he was sentenced to undergo life imprisonment with a fine of Rs.25,000/- and in default of payment of fine, one-year additional rigorous imprisonment. 
Challenging his conviction and sentence, he had moved to the HC.
Besides challenging his conviction, the Accused submitted that he had been in jail since last around 10 years and considering the aforesaid quality of evidence available against him, his sentence may be reduced to 10 years (period already undergone) which is the minimum sentence under Section 376(2)(f) of the IPC.
As per the prosecution's case, the victim's mother had put the victim by the side of the appellant (with whom she had cordial relations) who was sleeping on the ground and when she came back to take her after half an hour, she found that the appellant had kept his face covered with bedding but when she took her daughter in her arms, her hands had blood on them as her daughter was bleeding from her private parts profusely. 
Initially, she was asked not to tell anyone about the incident by the family of the appellant, however, after around 4-5 days, the mother of the victim informed her about the incident to her sister-in-law and thereafter her brother and husband also came to know about it and the FIR was lodged.
Court's observations 
The Court noted the doctor who examined the victim had given her opinion that internal pain by the victim was suggestive of penetration. The Court found that this evidence was supported by the testimony of the mother of the victim. 
In view of this, being satisfied with the testimony of the doctor, the Court observed that it had no reason to disbelieve the deposition of the mother of the victim and her dilemma in going to the police station straight away. 
In such circumstances, the Court added, we do not have any hesitation to come to a conclusion that the victim was raped by the present appellant who was only three years old at the time of the incident.
"...this Court finds that the victim in the present case was a girl aged 3 years only, who was ravished by the appellant in whom the mother of the victim had shown full confidence when she left her daughter asleep alongside him, assuming that her daughter would be in the safe custody of the appellant, aged around 22 years but little did she know that appellant would not only break her faith but would also leave an indelible mark of devastation on the mind and body of the victim, in such circumstances, the rights and plight of the victim and her family members cannot be lost sight of, and thus, we find that the Life imprisonment awarded to the appellant is by no means severe or excessive," the Court further remarked.
Accordingly, the instant appeal being devoid of merits stood dismissed.
Case title - PAPPU v. THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH [CRIMINAL APPEAL No. 1132 of 2012]

Amid the cries of a 10-year-old child refusing to be taken away by his biological father, the Bombay High Court asked the maternal grandfather to handover the child’s custody to the father at the police station later in the day.
A division bench of Justices AS Gadkari and PD Naik denied to look at video footage of the child screaming for help and then physically fighting off the father while the latter attempted to forcibly take him away from the High Court premises. The court was seized with a contempt petition filed by the father against the maternal grandfather and uncle to handover the child's custody. 
Following submissions from all parties involved, the court said, “The fact therefore remains that the Order passed by this Court dated 1st February 2022 and upheld by the Hon’ble Supreme Court by its Order dated 16th September 2022 has not been complied with…” 
While the court noted that several attempts to handover custody in the past had failed, the physical and mental toll of the transition on the child was a pitiable plight to watch in the afternoon, onlookers said. 
Later in the evening the child’s physical custody was given to the father amongst heavy police protection at the Kasturba Marg police station in the distant western Mumbai suburb of Borivali. 
The Case 
After a prolonged illness with tuberculosis in 2016 and then breast cancer the following year, the child’s mother passed away in 2019. She was a professor with some of the oldest colleges in South Mumbai for several years. During her illness she was living with her parents and brother and that’s how even the child began living with them. 
Soon after the mother’s demise the grandparents as well as the father approached the Family court for the child’s custody. The family court ruled in the grandparents’ favour. However, on February 1, 2022, the Bombay High Court set aside the family court’s judgement and ordered that the child’s custody be with the father. 
The High Court observed that the animosity over the child’s custody between the warring parties may have contributed to the father being alienated from the child. Unfortunately for the child, even the maternal grandmother passed away in 2021. The Supreme Court on September 16, 2022 granted the child’s custody to the father by considering the demise of the grandmother. 
Subsequently, the father approached the Bombay High Court in a contempt petition. On December 13, 2022 the bench, to avoid “any complications and creation of scene or ruckus”, directed the senior Police Inspector to take the child’s custody from the grandparents’ building compound. 
But the attempt was futile as the child refused to go with the officer, who then apprised the High Court about the same. Finally on Monday, the maternal family agreed to hand over the child’s custody to the father but the child refused again.
On Tuesday the court suggested the handover happen in court “to avoid any bickering or scene being created by either of the parties.” However, the court was informed that the child tried to assault the father and ran away from his custody. 
The family’s lawyer denied allegations of assault. 
“Respondent Nos.1 & 2 (Grandfather and Uncle) are directed to take the child in the precincts of Kasturba Marg Police Station, Mumbai at about 7.00 pm today. We also direct the Senior Inspector of Police, Kasturba Marg Police Station, Mumbai to depute two Police Officers out of which one be lady Police Officer to monitor the handing over of the custody of Master ‘J’ in favour of Petitioner by Respondent Nos.1 & 2 and to assist in avoiding breach of peace or any scene created by either of the parties, if necessary,” the court said in the order.

The Calcutta High Court on Friday asked IPS officer Damayanti Sen to oversee the probe in the Namkhana rape case wherein a 40-year-old woman was reportedly gang-raped on April 8 by five men in West Bengal's Namkhana village and an attempt had also been made to pour kerosene inside the victim's private parts and set her ablaze.IPS officer Damayanti Sen, now the special commissioner of...
The Calcutta High Court on Friday asked IPS officer Damayanti Sen to oversee the probe in the Namkhana rape case wherein a 40-year-old woman was reportedly gang-raped on April 8 by five men in West Bengal's Namkhana village and an attempt had also been made to pour kerosene inside the victim's private parts and set her ablaze.
IPS officer Damayanti Sen, now the special commissioner of Calcutta police, was the intelligence chief of the Calcutta police during the Park Street gang-rape case that took place a decade ago. She was the investigating officer of the incident which took place just a year after Mamata Banerjee became the Chief Minister of Bengal for the first time. The Chief Minister had reportedly commented that this case was a "doctored incident" and also a "chotto ghotona" (minor incident). Immediately after the investigation, the Bengal government had transferred IPS Sen. 
The Court had earlier also directed the IPS officer to supervise the investigation of 4 other recent rape cases in Deganga, Matia, Ingrejbazar and Banshdroni villages of West Bengal.  The direction was issued while adjudicating upon two Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petitions seeking a CBI probe into the rape case. 
The Court on the last date of hearing had directed the State government to produce a report relating to the status of investigation into the cases and also the case diary on the next date of hearing.
A Bench comprising Chief Justice Prakasha Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj on Friday took on record the status report as well as the case diary pertaining to the investigation into the rape case. 
Pursuant to the perusal of the case diary and also the status report, the Court directed, 
"Having examined the case diary and considering the report in the form of the affidavit and also taking note of the allegations made and progress of investigation, we deem it proper that investigation in this case be carried out under the supervision of Damyanti Sen, Special Commissioner of Police."
The Court however observed that in case the IPS officer has any difficulty in supervising the investigation, she will be at liberty to intimate the same to the Court on the next date of hearing. The Court also directed the State government to submit a further status report on the next date of hearing which is slated to take place on May 2.
The Court noted that the record shows that the concerned medical officer had found burn injuries on the body of the victim. Furthermore, the Court underscored that it has not rejected the prayer of the petitioners for a CBI probe and that in case it is found that the investigation is not being carried out in an impartial manner, the prayer for a CBI probe would be considered at a belated stage. It was further directed that the concerned authorities must extend full protection to the victim, her family members and other witnesses. 
During the proceedings, the petitioner alleged that the investigation into the case is not being done properly and that the kerosene jar has not yet been seized. It was further contended that the statements of the neighbours who had heard the cries of the victim have not been recorded by the police authorities. The Court was also apprised that mo offence under Section 307 of the IPC (rape) has been registered and that the place of occurrence has not been sealed by the authorities. The petitioner further averred that the local police officers had been intimidating the husband of the victim and also other witnesses. 
On the contrary, Advocate General S.N Mookherjee apprised the Court that initially an offence was registered on April 9 on the basis of the compliant filed. Thereafter, on receipt of information that rape had been committed, the police authorities had registered a case under Section 376(D) of the IPC on April 11. He further submitted that the statement of the victim under Section 164 of the CrPC and the statements of the witnesses under Section 161 of the CrPC have been recorded. The Advocate General further submitted that the main accused has been arrested and the medico-legal examinations of both the accused and the victim have been done. 
The matter is slated to be heard next on May 2. 
Case Title: Pallabi Chatterjee and Ors v. State of West Bengal and other connected matters

The Supreme Court reiterated that the prosecution under the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act cannot continue if the accused is discharged from the scheduled offence.
The court observed thus while allowing a writ petition filed by one Indrani Patnaik and others. They contended that their prosecution in relation to the scheduled offence had already come to an end as they were discharged from the criminal case. They contended that consequentially, the PMLA proceedings also could not continue. 
The Additional Solicitor General on the other hand, submitted that he has not received further instructions as to whether the prosecuting agency has challenged the said order or not.
"The record as it stands today, the petitioners stand discharged of the scheduled offence and therefore, in view of the law declared by this Court, there could arise no question of they being prosecuted for illegal gain of property as a result of the criminal activity relating to the alleged scheduled offence. That being the position, we find no reason to allow the proceedings against the petitioners under PMLA to proceed further.", the bench of Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sudhanshu Dhulia said.
The bench relied on the following observations made in the recent judgment in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary vs Union of India  (SC) 633: 
"The offence under Section 3 of the 2002 Act is dependent on illegal gain of property as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. It is concerning the process or activity connected with such property, which constitutes the offence of money-laundering. The Authorities under the 2002 Act cannot prosecute any person on notional basis or on the assumption that a scheduled offence has been committed, unless it is so registered with the jurisdictional police and /or pending enquiry/trial including by way of criminal complaint before the competent forum. If the person is finally discharged/acquitted of the scheduled offence or the criminal case against him is quashed by the Court of competent jurisdiction, there can be no offence of money-laundering against him or any one claiming such property being the property linked to stated scheduled offence through him."
The court however reserved liberty to Enforcement Directorate in seeking revival of these proceedings if the order discharging the petitioners is annulled or in any manner varied, and if there be any legitimate ground to proceed under PMLA.

The Rajasthan High Court on Monday directed the Central government to expeditiously decide on the claim application filed by a depositor of the beleaguered Adarsh Credit Co-operative Society Ltd.
It ordered that the said decision has to be taken preferably within a period of 90 days, strictly in accordance with the law.
 Justice Dinesh Mehta ordered,
"The respondents are directed to take a decision on the application filed by the petitioner expeditiously, preferably within a period of ninety days from the date of receipt of copy of this order strictly in accordance with rules and guidelines governing the field."
 The Adarsh Credit Co-op Society allegedly floated several fake companies and siphoned off its depositors money, approximately Rs. 8,000 Crore.
In the present case, the grievance raised by the petitioner is that he had made certain deposits in the Co-operative Society under various schemes and heads, however, subsequently the establishment has been closed. 
Advocate Surendra Bagmalani for the petitioner submitted that though a Liquidator was also appointed at the instance of Union of India and deposits of several creditors have been released, however, the deposits made by the petitioner have not been released.
 In furtherance of this, a limited prayer was made before the court to direct the respondents to take a decision on the claim application of the petitioner seeking release of the amount lying deposited with Adarsh Credit Co-operative Society Ltd.

In a petition filed to ensure convenient air travel for persons with disabilities, the Supreme Court of India on Wednesday observed that differently abled persons with prosthetic limbs/calipers should not be asked to remove the prosthetics at airport security checks so as to maintain human dignity. The Court also observed that lifting a person with disability during air travel or security checkup is inhumane, and held that the same should not be done without the person's consent. A Bench comprising Justice Hemant Gupta and Justice V Ramasubramanian was hearing a 2012 petition filed by Jeeja Ghosh, a disability rights activist, who was forcibly de-boarded from a Spicejet flight due to her disability. In 2016, the Supreme Court had directed Spicejet to pay Rs 10 lakhs as compensation to Ghosh for violating her right to dignity. The Court had issued further directions to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation(DGCA) to modify its guidelines to ensure the dignity of persons with disability during air travel. As a follow up, the Court considered the subsequent guidelines framed by the DGCA in this regard. In February 2017, the Court had commented that the suitable amendments are required for the revised Civil Aviation Requirements(CAR) guidelines in order to effectively take care of persons with disabilities. The Director General of Civil Aviation was directed to look into the suggestions submitted by the petitioner and to make further appropriate amendments to CAR guidelines as may be necessary after considering this court's directions and petitioners' remarks. On July 2, 2021, the DGCA came up with a new draft guidelines "Carriage by Air of Persons with Disability and/or Persons with Reduced Mobility'. Dr. Colin Gonsalves, the Senior Advocate representing the petitioner, raised multiple objections to the draft guidelines. The Bench has granted liberty to the petitioners to submit their suggestions and objections to the Ministry of Civil Aviation with respect to the revised draft Civil Aviation Requirements guidelines issued for persons with disability and reduced mobility. The Bench has granted liberty to the petitioner to submit objections, and suggestions to the draft guidelines and has expressed hope that the Ministry of Civil Aviation will consider such suggestions and objections even if the time limit for submission of the suggestions has come to an end. The Bench has asked the petitioner to file the suggestions in 30 days. While disposing of the petition with the above direction, the bench made two crucial observations :
1. No differently abled person should be manually lifted without his consent. Lifting of a person manually is inhumane. The suggestion in this regard made by the petitioner merits consideration. 2. The security check up at airports should be done in such a manner that no disabled person is required to remove the prostethic limbs/calibers. 
The Calcutta High Court on Monday came down heavily on a lawyer for having procured anticipatory bail before the concerned Sessions Court through 'fraud' and by making a 'brazen incorrect submission' that no such similar relief had been previously turned down by the same Sessions Court or the High Court.

The Calcutta High Court on Monday came down heavily on a lawyer for having procured anticipatory bail before the concerned Sessions Court through 'fraud' and by making a 'brazen incorrect submission' that no such similar relief had been previously turned down by the same Sessions Court or the High Court. A Bench comprising Justice Bivas Pattanayak and Justice Joymalya Bagchi expressed displeasure at the conduct of the lawyer by underscoring that members of the legal profession are expected to perform their duties with utmost honesty. "Legal profession is a noble profession. Its members are expected to perform their duties with responsibility and honesty and uphold the high and moral ideals of the profession. The present case is one which exposes the unfortunate and deplorable sharp practices resorted to by a member of the said profession to procure an order of anticipatory bail in favour of his client by misleading the Court by making false submissions that no earlier prayer to an anticipatory bail had been turned down earlier either by the session court or the high court", the Court averred. The Court was adjudicating upon an application for cancellation of anticipatory bail under Section 439(2) of the CrPC. The counsel appearing for the opposite party nos. 2 and 3 sought to support the impugned order dated November 18, 2020 granting anticipatory bail by contending that there had been no suppression of material fact as it had been mentioned in the affidavit accompanying the application for anticipatory bail that a prayer for anticipatory bail had been rejected in an earlier occasion. It was further argued that no such submission as recorded in the impugned order was made by the lawyer before the Sessions Court. The Bench observed with disdain that the 'hollowness' of the submissions made has been exposed form the material on record. Opining that the conduct of the concerned counsel was motivated to avoid any judicial scrutiny, the Court enumerated further, 
"In fact subterfuge and/or sharp practice resolved to procure the impugned order of bail is evident from the fact that the pleadings regarding rejection of similar prayer has not been pleaded in the body of the application but is surreptitiously couched in the affidavit accompanying the application so as to avoid judicial scrutiny by the presiding judge." It was further noted that during oral arguments before the Sessions Court the counsel had made a 'brazen incorrect submission' that no prayer for anticipatory bail had been turned down previously by the Sessions Court or the High Court. The Sessions Court had granted anticipatory bail on the basis of such an incorrect submission, the Court stated further. The Bench further dismissed the contention that the Sessions Judge had wrongly recorded the counsel's submissions by underscoring that if that had been the case then the litigant would have promptly made an application before the said court to correct the erroneous recording. Opining further that the impugned order granting anticipatory bail had been obtained through 'fraud and sharp practice', the Court noted that a regular bail had also been obtained on the basis of the impugned order. "On the other hand, upon obtaining the order of pre- arrest bail on the strength of misleading and incorrect submission, the opposite party nos. 2 and 3 immediately proceeded to obtain regular bail on the strength of such order. These facts leave no doubt in our mind that the order impugned was procured through fraud and sharp practice. When the very foundation of an order is with fraud, the same is rendered void ab initio and ought to be set aside on such ground alone", the Court averred further. The Bench further underscored that the contention that necessary documents were not available and thus could not be presented before the Sessions Court cannot be a justification for entertaining a subsequent application for pre-arrest bail. Accordingly, the Court set aside the impugned order granting anticipatory bail as well as the the consequential order of regular bail by observing that they had been procured through fraud and suppression of material facts and is thus void ab initio. Opposite party nos. 2 and 3 were directed to appear before the concerned Sessions Court within seven days and pray for regular bail in accordance with law. If they fail to do so, the investigating agency and the court below shall take all appropriate steps for apprehending the opposite party nos. 2 and 3 in accordance with law, the Court directed further. Advocate Sumanta Ganguly appeared for the petitioner. Advocates S Bardhan and Shiladitya Banerjee represented the State.

The Gujarat High Court has expressed shock at the functioning of over 5,000 schools in the State without a valid and subsisting No Objection Certificate with regard to the Fire Prevention and Protection Systems.
 A Division Bench comprising of Justices JB Pardiwala and Ilesh J. Vora sternly remarked,
 "How is this permissible? How can one play with the innocent lives of the students studying in such schools? If no steps are taken in this direction at the earliest, then this Court may be compelled to ask the State Government to cancel the recognition of such schools."
 The observation was made in a PIL filed by Advocate Amit Manilal Panchal seeking proper implementation of fire safety norms across all public accessible buildings in the State, in wake of the Shrey Hospital fire incident in Ahmedabad in August 2020, that took eight lives.
 Earlier, the High Court had sought response form the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation with respect to hospitals, schools, etc. that are operating without NOCs.
 Fire Safety at Schools
 During the hearing held on February 26, the Division Bench was taken aback to note that 5199 schools lack fire safety measures. It noted that fire safety in schools is often a neglected element in India as there are no rules for checking this aspect and even the Government does not enforce the existing norms.
 The Court has now asked the Gujarat Government to consider framing fire safety regulations in suit with the Haryana Government, which has notified a State Policy on the "Safety Measures in Government and Private Aided & Un-aided Schools" under which all Government and Private Aided & Un-aided Schools situated in Haryana are required to put in place prescribed minimum safety standards, in addition to those enshrined in the National Building Code of India, 2005.
 The Division Bench observed that fire safety is an extremely important issue and Schools must step up and take the responsibility to ensure that all possible safety precautions are maintained.
 It explained that in schools, a large number of children are gathered at one place and a single fire can affect all of them. it further noted that features like wooden furniture, canteens and chemistry labs also make schools prone and fire in such places can often go out of control.
 Inter alia, the Court clarified that schools are entirely responsible for safety of children and they cannot expect the government to install any fire safety provisions. It has issued following directions:
 Every school must take the necessary precautions in order to prevent anything untoward from happening in the case of an emergency, like a fire. Every floor must have a fire extinguisher or at the very least sand banks must be set in place. Teachers and non-teaching staff such as peons and other helpers must be instructed in the use of fire extinguishers. Schools must have a particular method set in place for emergency evacuation of students and drills must be conducted on a frequent basis. Schools must be in contact with emergency services like the fire and rescue department and ensure that they respond as soon as possible in case of an emergency. Fire alarms must be placed at strategic points and they must be checked regularly. 
 Fire Safety at Hospitals
 The Court, while dealing with implementation of fire safety norms in hospitals at Ahmedabad, also issued notices to eight other Municipal Corporations in the State including those of Vadodara, Surat, Gandhinagar, etc.
 All these authorities have been asked to file details of hospitals and other high-rise buildings that are operating without fire safety NOC.
 During the hearing, the Bench also impressed upon the State Government to adopt the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010, with a view to provide the minimum standards of medical facilities and services to the people at large.
 The Act prescribes basic minimum standards for different categories of clinical establishments for ensuring provision of proper health-care by the clinical establishments. Its purpose is to make available a database of Clinical Establishments which are authorized to function.
 While asking the Government to make an appropriate statement (by the next date of hearing) as regards adopting the Act, the Bench said,
 "Since decades, the unorganized health sector has created major hurdles in the availability, accessibility and affordability of health-care to the common people. This Act would prove handy, as this would ensure the minimum standards to all the establishments providing health-care services. The mandatory registration of all types of health-care provisions will reduce quackery. There will be standardization of infrastructure, man power and working systems."
 The Court added that the private health-care providers, who deliver the bulk of the health-care, may create hindrances in the way of the State Government in the implementation of the Act. however, the push back, if any, should not deter the State Government in implementing and adopting the Act at the earliest in the larger interest of the people.
 The matter is now fixed for April 16.

The Supreme Court has held that entries in balance sheets can amount to acknowledgement of debt for the purpose of extending limitation under Section 18 of the Limitation Act.
A bench headed by Justice RF Nariman set aside a judgment of Full Bench of National Company Law Appellate Tribunal in the case V Padmakumar v Stressed Assets Stabilization Fund which held otherwise. 
Issues
The issue raised before the Apex Court bench in appeal was whether an entry made in a balance sheet of a corporate debtor would amount to an acknowledgement of liability under Section 18 of the Limitation Act.? Yet another issue was whether Section 18 of the Limitation Act, which extends the period of limitation depending upon an acknowledgement of debt made in writing and signed by the corporate debtor, is also applicable under Section 238A, given the expression "as far as may be" governing the applicability of the Limitation Act to the IBC? (Second issue, the bench observed that it is settled that Section 18 is applicable)
To answer the first issue, the bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Hrishikesh Roy referred to various decisions which have held that an entry made in the books of accounts, including the balance sheet, can amount to an acknowledgement of liability within the meaning of Section 18 of the Limitation Act. [ Mahabir Cold Storage v. CIT, 1991 Supp (1) SCC 402; A.V. Murthy v. B.S. Nagabasavanna, (2002) 2 SCC 642; S. Natarajan vs. Sama Dharman, Crl. A. No. 1524 of 2014].
 Particularly referring to an old Calcutta High Court decision in Bengal Silk Mills Co. v. Ismail Golam Hossain Ariff, 1961 SCC OnLine Cal 128 : AIR 1962 Cal 115, the bench observed:
"Importantly, this judgment holds that though the filing of a balance sheet is by compulsion of law, the acknowledgement of a debt is not necessarily so. In fact, it is not uncommon to have an entry in a balance sheet with notes annexed to or forming part of such balance sheet, or in the auditor's report, which must be read along with the balance sheet, indicating that such entry would not amount to an acknowledgement of debt for reasons given in the said note."
Referring to various provisions of Companies Act qua filing of Balance Sheets, the bench observed thus:
A perusal of the aforesaid Sections would show that there is no doubt that the filing of a balance sheet in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act is mandatory, any transgression of the same being punishable by law. However, what is of importance is that notes that are annexed to or forming part of such financial statements are expressly recognised by Section 134(7). Equally, the auditor's report may also enter caveats with regard to acknowledgements made in the books of accounts including the balance sheet. A perusal of the aforesaid would show that the statement of law contained in Bengal Silk Mills (supra), that there is a compulsion in law to prepare a balance sheet but no compulsion to make any particular admission, is correct in law as it would depend on the facts of each case as to whether an entry made in a balance sheet qua any particular creditor is unequivocal or has been entered into with caveats, which then has to be examined on a case by case basis to establish whether an acknowledgement of liability has, in fact, been made, thereby extending limitation under Section 18 of the Limitation Act.
Taking note of these judgments, the bench observed that the majority decision of the Full Bench in V. Padmakumar (supra) is contrary to the aforesaid catena of judgments.
"The minority judgment of Justice (Retd.) A.I.S. Cheema, Member (Judicial), after considering most of these judgments, has reached the correct conclusion. We, therefore, set aside the majority judgment of the Full Bench of the NCLAT dated 12.03.2020. The NCLAT, in the impugned judgment dated 22.12.2020, has, without reconsidering the majority decision of the Full Bench in V. Padmakumar (supra), rubber-stamped the same. We, therefore, set aside the aforesaid impugned judgment also.", the court added.
Background
Last year, a 3-member bench NCLAT had doubted the correctness of the decision rendered by a 5-member bench in the case V. Padamakumar Vs. Stressed Assets Stabilization Fund (SASF) & Anr which had held that entries in books of accounts will not amount to acknowledgment of debt under Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963. Later, a 5-member bench turned down the reference observing that the same was unwarranted as V Padmakumar decision was in accordance with Supreme Court precedents. The 5-judge bench had also made certain adverse remarks against the 3-member bench for doubting the correctness of V Padmakumar.  Aggrieved with the adverse remarks, the 3 members approach the Supreme Court. A bench headed by Justice Nariman expunged those remarks, allowing the petition filed by the NCLAT members.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court observed that a notice under Section 50 of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 should specify what rights the accused has under the NDPS Act.
Merely informing the accused that he had rights under the NDPS Act, without specifying what rights the accused had under the NDPS Act, would not constitute compliance with the mandatory requirement, Justice B.S. Walia observed.
In this bail petition, the accused contended that he was not informed of his right to be searched in the presence of a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate if he so desired, therefore, there was non-compliance with Section 50 NDPS Act. The State, produced the Notice that was issued to the accused, submitted that he was informed of his rights, besides option to get his search conducted by a Magistrate or Gazetted Officer for which the said Officer could be called on the spot, therefore in the circumstances, there was due compliance with the mandate of Section 50 NDPS Act.
The court observed that this notice  mentions the accused has been apprised of his rights. But the said notice is absolutely silent as to what rights were apprised to the petitioner as also whether he was apprised of his right under Section 50 NDPS Act, to be searched in the presence of a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer, the court noted.
"The said notice merely mentions the petitioner having been informed of his rights as also the option if he so desired to get his search conducted by a Magistrate or Gazetted officer. To my mind, merely informing the petitioner that he had rights under the NDPS Act, without specifying what rights the petitioner had under the NDPS Act, would not constitute compliance with the mandatory requirement under Section 50 sub- Section (1) NDPS Act.",  the court observed.
The bench, referring to various judgments, observed that the requirement under Section 50 NDPS Act is not merely a technical breach. Since the accused is not involved in any other case under the NDPS, the court observed that it can safely be recorded that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the accused is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any such offence while on bail. Therefore, the bail was granted to accused.
Case name: Sunil vs. State of Haryana [CRM-M No.28067 of 2021 ] 

The Madras High Court recently reprimanded the growing practice of temple properties being leased out for commercial purposes which are unrelated to the objective of worship, thereby degrading the heritage value of the temples.

The Madras High Court recently reprimanded the growing practice of temple properties being leased out for commercial purposes which are unrelated to the objective of worship, thereby degrading the heritage value of the temples. 
A Bench comprising Justice T.S Sivagnanam and Justice S. Anathi observed with anguish, 
"The Authorities' unmindful of the heritage value of various temples had licensed and leased out the temple property as well as the pragarams and verandas of the temples to traders to carry on trading activity by selling articles which are unrelated and unconnected with the temple and the worshipping public. These shops have virtually become shopping centres, if not, shopping malls" 
The Court was hearing a PIL filed by one K. Suresh, seeking restoration of certain daily rituals at the Adhikesavan Temple as per its scriptures (Agamams) at par with the Padmanabhaswamy Temple at Thiruvananthapuram. Suresh stated that though he had sent a representation to the concerned temple authorities on March 5, 2021, no action in this regard had been taken.
The counsel for the petitioner had argued that the people of the locality hold the deity with utmost reverence and as a result they were extremely disheartened to see the temple not being maintained properly and the rituals not being performed as per the scriptures. 
Taking cognisance of the grievance raised, the Court noted that despite the fire accident that had taken place at the Madurai's Meenakshi Amman temple back in 2018, the concerned authorities were yet to mend their ways. Thus, it was not only the Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments Department (HR &CE Department) that is to be blamed for such an unfortunate state of affairs, the Court added. 
"Even today, there was a writ appeal listed before us for admission, at the instance of the licensee, stating that he is entitled to continue to run a shop within the temple, rather the shop is embedded in the temple's wall. If such is the situation, obviously, the temple will be without funds and sorry state of affairs cannot be avoided. Therefore, the HR & CE Department alone is not to be blamed, but there are several persons to be blamed for such sorry state of affairs," the Court stated. 
However, the Court acknowledged that it is undoubtedly the duty of the HR and CE Department to maintain the temple and preserve the heritage value of the temple for posterity. Further, the Court also agreed with the petitioner that in several temples of Tamil Nadu poojas were not being performed due to inadequate funds. 
"In our considered view, there are several people who have contributed to this issue resulting in the temples being funds starved. The poojaris not being paid in time, rituals unable to be performed for lack of funds etc. The lessees of the temple are one of the main persons, who are to be blamed for the temples being left without sufficient funds. Several cases are filed before this Court by the lessees claiming that they are entitled to continue indefinitely in temple property paying a paltry sum as a rent or license fee", the Court opined. 
 The Court however ruled that it cannot allow the petitioner's prayer and instead directed him to approach the appropriate forum for remedy. 
"If the petitioner has material with him as to how the Arulmighu Adhikesavan Temple has to be preserved, restored and maintained, he can share the details with the Authorities by way of detailed representation. So far as the relief sought for in the writ petition is concerned, this in our opinion is a civil right and if according to the petitioner, a particular sect of people have to perform that particular ritual as recorded in the Register of Agamams, then the petitioner's remedy lies else where and not by way of writ petition", the order read.

The Supreme Court has observed that the onus to prove that an employee was not gainfully employed elsewhere when his service was terminated is on the employer.
An employee is not required to prove the negative that he was not gainfully employed.
Once he asserts that he is not gainfully employed, thereafter the onus will shift to the employer positively and it would be for the employer to prove that the employee was gainfully employed, the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna observed.
In this case, the writ petitioner (employee) claimed the back wages for the period subsequent to the order of reinstatement passed by the High Court (single bench) and the writ petitioner remained out of employment even thereafter due to the order of stay passed in the appeal preferred by the management. He contended that, on dismissal of the appeal of the management and the stay being vacated, the judgment and order passed by the  Single Judge, setting aside the termination and ordering reinstatement came to be confirmed, as a natural consequence, he shall be entitled to back wages during the period he remained unemployed in view of the order of stay granted by the appellate court, which was at the instance of the management, subject to the management proving or producing any material on record that even during the said period the employee was gainfully employed. This writ petition was allowed by the High Court.
Before the Apex Court, in appeal, it was contended by the employer that the employee has not established and proved by leading cogent evidence that he was not gainfully employed during the period he was out of employment and therefore he shall not be entitled to the back wages.
The Court noted that the writ petitioner had a specific case that he remained out of employment for the period from 23.08.2002 to 30.04.2007 and that he was gainfully employed during the period from 01.05.2007 to 20.01.2011. Thereafter, he was not required to lead any further evidence to prove the negative, the court said.
"An employee cannot be asked to prove the negative. However, he has to at least assert on oath that he was neither employed nor engaged in any gainful business or venture and that he did not have any income. Thereafter the employee is not supposed to prove the negative that he was not gainfully employed. There cannot be any evidence to prove the negative to the effect that he is not gainfully employed. Once he asserts that he is not gainfully employed, thereafter the onus will shift to the employer positively and it would be for the employer to prove that the employee was gainfully employed."
Upholding the High Court order, the bench observed that the employee/writ petitioner cannot be denied the back wages for no fault of his and that the principle of "no work no pay" shall not be applicable.

"Prescribing 50 years as a minimum age limit for consideration of advocates has the devastating effect of entirely excluding successful young advocates"The Supreme Court has held by 2:1 majority that the minimum age limit of 50 years prescribed by the Tribunals Reforms(Rationalization and Conditions of Service) Ordinance 2021 for appointment as members in various tribunals to be "arbitrary and discriminatory".
The majority comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat observed that this minimum age stipulation of 50 years introduced by the Ordinance violated the earlier direction given by the Court in the 2020 Madras Bar Association case that advocates with minimum experience of 10 years should be made eligible for appointment as members of tribunals.
The 3-judge was delivering judgment in the fresh writ petition filed by Madras Bar Association this year challenging the Tribunals Reforms Ordinance. Justice Hemant Gupta dissented from the majority and dismissed the writ petition.
This minimum age stipulation was brought in through first proviso to Section 184(1) of the Finance Act 2017 which was added through the amendment effected by the Tribunals Reforms Ordinance passed in 2021.
Holding this provision to be unconstitutional, the judgment authored by Justice Nageswara Rao said :
"Fixing a minimum age for recruitment of Members as 50years would act as a deterrent for competent advocates to seek appointment. Practically, it would be difficult for an advocate appointed after attaining the age of 50 years to resume legal practice after completion of one term, in case he is not reappointed. Security of tenure and conditions of service are recognised as core components of independence of the judiciary. Independence of the judiciary can be sustained only when the incumbents are assured of fair and reasonable conditions of service, which include adequate renumeration and security of tenure. Therefore, the first proviso to Section 184(1) is in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers as the judgment of this Court in MBA-III has been frustrated by an impermissible legislative override. Resultantly, the first proviso to Section 184 (1) is declared as unconstitutional as it is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution". 
Also Read -  Tribunals Reforms Ordinance : Certain Points Of Concern 
Age limit of 50 years excludes young successful advocates from the zone of consideration
Justice Ravindra Bhat wrote a separate but concurring judgment, which elaborated why the minimum age limit for 50 years for appointment as members in tribunals is arbitrary and irrational. Justice Bhat pointed out that as per the Constitution, an advocate with experience of 10 years is eligible to be appointed as a High Court. An advocate with 7 years' practice with the Bar can be considered for appointment to the position of a District Judge. Hence, this prescription of 50 years as minimum age for appointment in tribunals was lacking in rationale.
"Prescribing 50 years as a minimum age limit for consideration of advocates has the devastating effect of entirely excluding successful young advocates, especially those who might be trained and competent in the particular subject(such as Indirect Taxation, Anti-Dumping, Income-Tax, International Taxation and Telecom Regulation). The exclusion of such eligible candidates in preference to those who are more than 50 years of age is inexplicable and therefore entirely arbitrary", Justice Bhat said.
"Prescribing 50 years' minimum age as a condition for appointment to these tribunals is arbitrary also because absolutely no reason is forthcoming about what impelled Parliament to divert from the long-established criteria of giving weigh-age to actual practice, reputation, integrity and subject expertise, without a mini-mum age criterion, in the pleadings in this case, nor in any other cases", he added.
Justice Bhat said that the consideration of such younger advocates in the age group of 40-45 years would have long term benefits since the do-main knowledge and expertise in such areas (Telecom Regulation, Taxation –both Direct and Indirect, GATT Rules, International Taxation etc.) would be useful in adjudication in these tribunals and lead to a body of jurisprudence. Depending on how such counsel/advocates fare as members of the Tribunal, having regard to their special knowledge of these laws, at a later and appropriate stage, they may even be considered for appointment to High Courts.
Anomalous results of the age limit of 50 years
"The age criteria, impugned in this case also leads to wholly anomalous and absurd results. For instance, an advocate with 18- or 20-years' practice, aged 44years, with expertise in the field of indirect taxation, telecom, or other regulatory laws, would be conversant with the subject matter. Despite being eligible, (as she or he would fulfil the parameters of at least 10 years' practice, in the light of the decision in MBA-III) such a candidate would be excluded. On the other hand, an individual who might have practiced law for 10 years, and later served as a private or public sector executive in an entirely unrelated field, but who might be 50 years of age, would be considered eligible, and can possibly secure appointment as a member of a tribunal. Thus, the age criterion would result in filtering out candidates with more relevant experience and qualifications, in preference to those with lesser relevant experience, only on the ground of age"
Age limit 'virtually picked from a hat' and has no 'rational nexus'.
"..the qualification of a minimum age of 50 years as essential for appointment, is discriminatory because it is neither shown to have a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved, i.e. appointing the most meritorious candidates; nor is it shown to be based on any empirical study or data that such older candidates fare better, or that younger candidates with more relevant experience would not be as good, as members of tribunals. It is plain and simple, discrimination based on age. The criterion (of minimum 50 years of age) is virtually "picked out from a hat"40 and wholly arbitrary".
No equivalence between members of civil service and legal professionals
The Attorney General sought to justify the condition by arguing that it was intended to bring parity with the members of civil service. Justice Bhat said that legal professionals and members of civil service cannot be equated.
"..a civil servant's experience,though varied and diverse – ranging from co-ordination and administration at taluk, district and state levels, to devising, framing and implementing thegovernment's policies and programmes, to managing statutory corporations and even commercial enterprises of the state, does not always entail adjudicator yfunctions. However, legal practitioners, chartered accountants and one segment of civil servants, i.e. tax administrators and adjudicators are involved in the day today interpretation of law, leading to adjudicatory outcomes. Such being the case,the equivalence of "status" of members of tribunals cannot be compared in a linear or rigid manner" 
Justice Bhat's judgment issued the following declaration :
"As a result of the above discussion, the proviso to Section 184 (1), inserted by the impugned ordinance is declared void. A declaration is issued that all candidates, otherwise eligible on their merit, based on qualifications and experience in the relevant field, are entitled to be considered, without reference to the impugned "minimum" age (of 50 years) criteria"
It may be noted that the Union Government on June 30 issued a notification enabling appointment of Advocates with ten years experience as Judicial Members of various Tribunals. The said notification amended the Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and other Authorities (Qualifications, Experience and other Conditions of Service of Members) Rules, 2020 in terms of the 2020 judgment in the Madras Bar Association case.
 In the Madras Bar Association judgment delivered in November 2020, the Supreme Court had observed that the exclusion of Advocates in 10 out of 19 tribunals, for consideration as judicial members is contrary to the judgments in Union of India v. Madras Bar Association (2010) and Madras Bar Association v. Union of India. The court had opined that, since the qualification for an advocate of a High Court for appointment as a Judge of a High Court is only 10 years, the experience at the bar should be on the same lines for being considered for appointment as a judicial member of a Tribunal.
Other provisions of Tribunals Ordinance 2021 held unconstitutional
The majority also held the following conditions laid down by the Tribunals Ordinance 2021 through its amendment to the Finance Act 2017 as unconstitutional :
The provisions fixing the term of Tribunal Members as 4 years struck down being contrary to the direction in earlier cases that the term should be 5 years.The provision prescribing that the Search cum Selection Committee will recommend two names for each post struck down being contrary to the direction in previous judgments that the committee should only recommend one name for each post.The provision prescribing that the Union Government should make appointments "preferably within three months" of recommendation by the Search-cum-Selection committee struck down as the earlier judgment in Madras Bar Association Case had issued a mandatory direction that the appointments should be made within 3 months of recommendation by the Search-cum-Selection Committee.
Justice Rao concluded his judgment by saying :
"...the first proviso and the second proviso,read with the third proviso, to Section 184 overriding the judgment of this Court in MBA-III in respect of fixing 50years as minimum age for appointment and payment of HRA,Section 184(7) relating to recommendation of two names for each post by the SCSC and further, requiring the decision to be taken by the Government preferably within three months are declared to be unconstitutional. Section 184(11)prescribing tenure of four years is contrary to the principles of separation of powers, independence of judiciary, rule oflaw and Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Though, we have upheld the proviso to Section 184(11), the appointments made to the CESTAT pursuant to the interim orders passed by this Court shall be governed by the relevant statute and the rules framed thereunder that existed prior to26.05.2017. We have already taken notice of the notification dated 30.06.21 by way of which Rule 15 of the 2020 Rules dealing with HRA has been amended in conformity with our directions in MBA-II".
Justice Bhat concluded his judgment as :
(i) The first proviso to Section 184(1) of the Finance Act, 2017, introduced by Section 12 of the Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service)Ordinance, 2021 is hereby declared void and inoperative. Similarly, the second proviso to Section 184(1) of the Finance Act, 2017, introduced by Section 12 of the Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021 is held to be void and inoperative.
(ii)Section 184(7) of the Finance Act, 2017, introduced by of the Finance Act,2017 introduced by Section 12 of the Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021 is hereby declared void and inoperative.
(iii) Section 184(11)(i) and (ii) introduced by Section 12 of the Tribunals(Reforms Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021 are hereby declared as void and unconstitutional.
(iv)Consequently, the declaration of this Court in para 53(iv) of MBA-III shall prevail and the term of Chairperson of a Tribunal shall be five years or till she or he attains the age of 70 years, whichever is earlier and the term of Member of aTribunal shall be five years or till she or he attains the age of 67 years, whichever is earlier.
(v)The retrospectivity given to the proviso to Section 184(11) – introduced by Section 12 of the Tribunals (Reforms Rationalisation and Conditions of Service)Ordinance, 2021 is hereby upheld; however, without in any manner affecting the appointments made to the post of Chairperson or members of various Tribunals,upto 04.04.2021. In other words, the retrospectivity of the provision shall not in any manner affect the tenures of the incumbents appointed as a consequence of this Court's various orders during the interregnum period.
Senior Advocate Arvind P Datar led the arguments for Madras Bar Association. Attorney General for India KK Venugopal appeared for the Union Government.

Observing that career guidance of students in Class XI and XII is crucial, the Delhi High Court has directed the Delhi government to consider having a system for career counselling of the students to ensure that an informed decision is taken by them regarding their subject choices.
Justice Sanjeev Narula in a ruling observed that it is essential that students are counselled in the decision-making process, and asked the authorities to step-in to ensure that there is an appropriate system of counselling or career guidance programmes in schools to assist students. 
"If students are made aware of admission policies of different universities, it could only help them in making an informed decision regarding their subject choices. Mr. Unmukt Gera, counsel for GNCTD, states that such systems must be in place, although he is unable to readily cite the same. Accordingly, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to GNCTD/ DoE to examine this issue in consultation with experts in the field and in case, any lacunae is required to be filled-in, they may do so by issuing appropriate directions to schools," the court said.
The court made the observations in its judgement on a plea filed by a father whose son failed to secure admission in colleges affiliated with Delhi University in 2020. The petitioner blamed the lack of career guidance at school for it. His argument was that when his son opted for Mass Media Studies and Physical Education in Class XI and XII, he was not cautioned that these subjects are not considered as "Main" subjects by DU and are instead treated as "Elective" attracting penalty of 2.5% deduction of marks from aggregate marks for the purpose of selection in colleges of DU.
The petition prayed for intervention of statutory authorities like Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Delhi government to ensure proper dispensation of information and guidance to students at the time of subject selection in Class XI and XII. It also sought action against the school and compensation for the alleged prejudice caused to the students.
The court said the prayer seeking cancellation of the accreditation of the school, lacks foundation and is untenable. "Improper career counselling to some students cannot be a ground for de-affiliation/ de-accreditation, in absence of any statutory provision that provides for such a penalty," it added.
Rejecting the prayer seeking compensation considering that highly disputed facts have emerged from the pleadings, the court said the school has asserted that guidelines issued by CBSE are diligently followed and students in Class XI are free to opt any subjects prescribed by CBSE.
"They explain that Petitioner opted for the subjects voluntarily and in consultation with his parents. All of the subjects taught/ available in the School, are recognised by CBSE and here is no basis for the School to consider some subjects more favourable than others. The School does not dissuade students from opting any subject. In light of the above, there is no basis for the Court to hold that the choice exercised by Petitioner was not voluntarily or was exercised under persuasion," Justice Narula said.
The court further said there is also no reason for it to hold that the school should have disapproved or opposed the option because of its likely impact on admission prospects to DU. "Petitioner's contention is farfetched and exhibits a very orthodox approach towards education centred around scoring marks. The School, on the other hand, would have a different approach of holistic development of students and would encourage them to select subjects based on their aptitude. Scoring of marks cannot therefore, be the sole criteria for selecting a subject," it said.
Observing that prayer seeking consideration of the petitioner's admission has become infructuous, the court said Common University Entrance Test has now been introduced for the admissions. The court also noted that the student has been able to secure admission in some other college and he is continuing his education there.
"Moreover, the Court has no reason to direct DU to dilute its standards for admission, as fixing the eligibility criteria is a policy- decision and lies within the exclusive domain of the University. No foundation or legal right has been demonstrated before this Court to issue any directions to DU qua admission procedure followed by them for intake of students under the erstwhile admission regime," it said.
However, while disposing of the direction, the court issued a direction to the government with regard to career counselling of Class XI and Class XII students.
Title: SHISHRAM AS GUARDIAN OF MR. KAWAL vs BAL BHAVAN INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL & ORS.

The Delhi High Court has refused to grant interim injunction in favour of Bolt Technology OU in relation to use of the mark ‘Bolt’ in EV (electric vehicle) charging stations in India by Ujoy Technology Private Limited.
The court observed that since Bolt is not engaged in providing EV charging services anywhere in the world and has merely installed some EV charging stations in a handful of locations for charging its own vehicles, no trans-border reputation in providing EV charging services can be credited to it which can be said to have spilled over to India.
"There is no justification, therefore, prima facie, for the Court to, by allowing the application of the petitioner, who has no market exposure whatsoever in India, and, prima facie, no spillover or percolation of its trans border reputation into India, to jeopardize the market, or the repute, that the defendant has earned by use of the impugned mark, for providing EV charging services," said the court.
Observing that Ujoy Technology is the first in the Indian market in providing EV charging services, the bench of Justice C. Hari Shankar said:
"In examining these aspects, the Court has to be acutely conscious of the cautionary note sounded both in Milmet Oftho and in Toyota, that the Court must not permit large multinational corporations, which have no intent of coming to India, to throttle an Indian company by not permitting it to sell its product in India."
Bolt Technology OU, formerly known as Taxify OU, is an Estonian Company which operates as a taxi aggregator. The court was told that it also provides ride-hailing, food and grocery delivery, rental of cars, e-bikes and scooters and EV (electric vehicle) charging stations/docks. 
In the suit filed before the High Court Bolt averred that Ujoy Technology by using the mark ‘Bolt’ in respect to EV charging stations in India, was passing off its products and services as those of Bolt’s.
Averring that the brand “BOLT” was conceived and adopted by it in 2018, the company pleaded that by continuous use, the mark ‘Bolt’ has amassed considerable goodwill and reputation and has become exclusively associated with its products and services.
Bolt argued that its ‘Bolt’ mark has amassed international reputation and goodwill, which has spilled over into India much before the adoption of the mark by the defendant. It further placed reliance on certain data sourced from the internet, which indicates the number of times Bolt’s App was accessed by drivers in Ahmedabad, Pune, Surat, Chennai and Kolkata.
Ujoy Technology contested Bolt’s claim that its ‘Bolt’ mark was entitled to be regarded as a “well known trade mark” under Section 2(1)(zg) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.
It contended that it is the largest player in India in the EV charging stations. It added that the EV charging stations/docks is not the business activity of Bolt and thus, Bolt does not enjoy any goodwill or reputation for the same.
It argued that use of the ‘Bolt’ mark by Bolt in relation to EV charging docks/ stations in Tallinn (Estonia), Lithuania and Portugal, can hardly be regarded as trans-border or worldwide reputation which can be said to have spilled over to India. 
The Court said Bolt admittedly has no trademark registration in India, though it has applied for registration of the trademark Bolt Charge and the Bolt device mark, which are pending with the Registrar of Trade Marks.
Observing that Bolt has no business, whatsoever, in India, the bench added that for establishing the tort of passing off, it has to be established that Bolt has a goodwill and reputation in India or that its goodwill and reputation, though garnered abroad, is so considerable that it has spilled over to India.
“In the present case, per contra, there is nothing, whatsoever, to indicate that the plaintiff was “in the EV-charging market” at all, even till date.” The “market”, in which Bolt was using the asserted ‘Bolt’ mark, was a market of taxi hailing services, with associated activities like food and grocery delivery and the like. In the EV-charging market, therefore, it becomes questionable whether the plaintiff can claim to be 'first'," said the court. 
It further took note that since Bolt has no commercial existence in India, even if persons in India were to download its App, no services of Bolt could be availed in India.
“The limited downloading of the plaintiff’s App by persons who may be travelling abroad to countries where the plaintiff’s services are available cannot, prima facie, be regarded as any sign of spillover of the plaintiff’s reputation into India, much less in the EV charging arena,” said the court.
The Court thus dismissed Bolt’s applications seeking interim injunction.

Punjab and Haryana High Court recently allowed relief to the ex-employee of Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited, who retired from service after attaining the age of superannuation but his pensionary benefits were withheld by the respondents.
 ….. once the petitioner is found innocent of the allegations alleged and has suffered prejudice only due to the actions of the respondent-Department as the petitioner was prevented from availing his pensionary benefits upon his retirement for a sufficient long period of time and also petitioner could not use those financial benefits to his benefit, the petitioner becomes entitled for the grant of interest on the delayed payments to mitigate the prejudice/hardship suffered by him, which is in consonance of settled principle of law.
 The bench comprising Justice Harsimran Singh Sethi further added that the respondents were well within their right to withhold certain pensionary benefits at the time of petitioner's retirement because there was criminal as well as departmental proceedings pending against him but after the proceedings there was no valid justification to retain the same.
 It is a conceded position that when the petitioner retired from service on 30.09.2015, there were criminal as well as departmental proceedings pending against the petitioner and the respondents were well within their right to withhold certain pensionary benefits admissible to the petitioner after retirement but after those proceedings ended, there was no valid justification to retain the same especially when the petitioner was exonerated of the allegations before the Criminal Court as well as in the departmental proceedings.
 In the present case, the petitioner retired from service in 2015 but the amount of gratuity and other benefits were retained by the respondents because there were criminal and departmental proceedings pending against him.
 The court further noted that acts attributable respondents cannot cause prejudice to an employee whose pension was firstly withheld on the basis of pendency of the charge sheets and thereafter, he was denied the interest on the delayed payments, despite the fact that he was found innocent in all those allegations.
 The acts which are attributable to the respondents cannot cause prejudice to an employee by firstly withholding his pensionary benefits on the basis of pendency of the charge sheets issued by the Department alleging certain allegations and thereafter, by denying him grant of interest on the delayed payments, despite the fact that the employee was found innocent as the Department concerned failed to prove those allegations.
 Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case, the court held that once the petitioner is found innocent of the allegations alleged, he becomes entitled for the grant of interest on the delayed payments to mitigate the prejudice/hardship suffered by him.
 Accordingly, the court allowed present writ petition.

The Supreme Court observed that the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal cannot recall orders passed by it invoking power under Section 254(2) of the Income Tax Act.
Section 254(2) power is only to correct and/or rectify the mistake apparent from the record and not beyond that, the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna said.
In this case, the ITAT allowed the Revenue's appeal and held that payments made for purchase of software are in the nature of royalty. The Assessee filed miscellaneous application for rectification under Section 254(2) of the Act. This miscellaneous application was allowed by ITAT by recalling its original order. This recall order was unsuccessfully challenged before the Bombay High Court
The bench noted that while allowing the application under Section 254(2) of the Act and recalling its earlier order, the ITAT has re-heard the entire appeal on merits as if the ITAT was deciding the appeal against the order passed by the C.I.T. I
"In exercise of powers under Section 254(2) of the Act, the Appellate Tribunal may amend any order passed by it under sub-section (1) of Section 254 of the Act with a view to rectifying any mistake apparent from the record only. Therefore, the powers under Section 254(2) of the Act are akin to Order XLVII Rule 1 CPC. While considering the application under Section 254(2) of the Act, the Appellate Tribunal is not required to re-visit its earlier order and to go into detail on merits. The powers under Section 254(2) of the Act are only to rectify/correct any mistake apparent from the record.", the court said.
The court observed that if the Assessee was of the opinion that the order passed by the ITAT was erroneous, either on facts or in law, in that case, the only remedy available to the Assessee was to prefer the appeal before the High Court. Setting aside the High Court judgment, the bench observed:
Merely because the Revenue might have in detail gone into the merits of the case before the ITAT and merely because the parties might have filed detailed submissions, it does not confer jurisdiction upon the ITAT to pass the order de hors Section 254(2) of the Act. As observed hereinabove, the powers under Section 254(2) of the Act are only to correct and/or rectify the mistake apparent from the record and not beyond that. Even the observations that the merits might have been decided erroneously and the ITAT had jurisdiction and within its powers it may pass an order recalling its earlier order which is an erroneous order, cannot be accepted. As observed hereinabove, if the order passed by the ITAT was erroneous on merits, in that case, the remedy available to the Assessee was to prefer an appeal before the High Court, which in fact was filed by the Assessee before the High Court, but later on the Assessee withdrew the same in the instant case

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently upheld an eviction order passed against a son and his wife at the instance of the father under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 (Senior Citizens Act).
In this case, the father had not transferred the house in question to the son by way of gift or any other deed.  The son sought to maintain the claim by saying that he had contributed to the renovation of the ground floor of the house.
The Court held that the son cannot insist that he has the right to stay in his father's home by saying that he has contributed to the renovation of the house.
"...the petitioners cannot maintain their claim on the alleged ground that petitioner No.1 had contributed towards the renovation of the house", the Court observed. 
The Court underscored that when children throw their parents at the mercy of their destiny and use their muscle power to torture and harass them, then parents' world gets totally shattered. 
"They become helpless from all sides and thus, begins the unfortunate tale of their moving from one Forum to another for redressal of their grievance(s)....Life is full with extraordinary challenges and unrivalled opportunities, but such chances must not be used against those, who parented you. With the birth of the children, the parents feel the paramount bliss of the Supreme Power and thank Him," the Court observed.
The Bench of Justice Harnaresh Singh Gill also quoted from Guru Granth Sahib while stating that children should treat their parents as God
"In the holy script of Sri Guru Granth Sahib, Sri Guru Ram Dass has written 'KAAHAY POOT JHAGRAT HA-O SANG BAAP/ JIN KAY JANAY BADEERAY TUM HA-O TIN SIO JHAGRAT PAPP//" (O son, why do you argue with your father? It is a sin to argue with the one who fathered you and raised you). The above words of prudence guide us that we have to treat our parents as God," the Court said.
The facts in brief
The Court was hearing a criminal writ petition filed by the petitioners( son and his wife) seeking to to dismiss the application filed by respondent No.4 (father) under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, whereby the petitioners had been ordered to be ejected from the house in question.
The application of the father was made to evict his son and daughter-in-law on the ground that the petitioners were not treating him and his wife properly and were depriving them even of the basic necessities and they also wanted to grab the property.
On their application, Sub Divisional Magistrate, Thanesar noted that the father was the owner of the house and in his report, he recommended ejectment of the petitioners and sent the same to the office of the District Magistrate.
Pursuant to this, DM, Kurukshetra via an order dated July 17, 2019, had ordered the ejectment of the petitioners from the house in question.
It was claimed by the petitioners that the house in question was a joint Hindu family property and therefore, they couldn't have been evicted from the house in question and that he had contributed towards its renovation. 
However, respondent number 4 (father) contended that the house in question is his self-acquired property, and rather it is not a joint Hindu family property. The 
Court's observations
Referring to Section 23 of the 2007 Act, the Court observed that this provision provides thus:
"if a senior citizen who, after the commencement of the 2007 Act, has transferred by way of gift or otherwise, his property, with the condition that the transferee would provide basic amenities and basic physical needs to the transferor, who thereafter refuses or fails to provide such amenities and physical needs, then the transfer of the property made by the senior citizen shall be deemed to have been made by fraud or coercion or under undue influence and shall at the option of the transferor, be declared void by the Tribunal."
The Court further referred to the Act to conclude that there is a provision for eviction in the 2007 Act. Against this backdrop, the Court HELD thus:
"Besides, the instant is not a case wherein any transfer or gift has been executed by respondent Nos.4 and 5 in favour of the petitioners. Thus, the petitioners cannot maintain their claim on the alleged ground that petitioner No.1 had contributed towards the renovation of the house."
Thus, in view of the above discussion, the Court did not find any merit in the present petition and hence, the same was dismissed.

The Madras High Court has recently reiterated that an accused can be convicted under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act solely based on the testimony of the victim child if such evidence is 'cogent, consistent, trust worthy and inspires the confidence' of the Court. Justice P Velmurugan observed, "In a cases of this nature, we cannot expect any eye witness...
The Madras High Court has recently reiterated that an accused can be convicted under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act solely based on the testimony of the victim child if such evidence is 'cogent, consistent, trust worthy and inspires the confidence' of the Court. 
Justice P Velmurugan observed, 
"In a cases of this nature, we cannot expect any eye witness or independent witness. The culprit will take a chance of the loneliness of the child and will commit the offence by trying to exploit the innocence of age of the children. It is settled proposition of law that when the evidence of prosecutrix is cogent, consistent and trust worthy and inspires confidence of the Court, conviction can be recorded solely based on the evidence of the victim, unless there is a reason to discord or disbelieve the evidence of the sole witness" 
The Court made the observing while dismissing a criminal appeal challenging a man's conviction under Sections 10 (punishment for aggravated sexual assault of a child) and 12 (punishment for sexual harassment) of the POCSO Act. In the instant case, the trial court had ordered Rs 2 lakh compensation for the sexual assault of the eleven-year old victim child. 
The prosecution had submitted that the accused was a neighbour who had tried to molest the victim child while she was alone at home. It had been further alleged that the accused had pulled her hand and showed his private parts to the victim child. A complaint had been lodged after the child narrated the events to her parents. 
During trial, the accused had contended that he was elsewhere during the time of the alleged incident. However, the Court refused to accept such a contention in the absence of any documentary evidence. 
Rejecting the plea of alibi, the Court observed, 
"But, it is seen that the appellant has failed to produce any valid documentary proof to prove his defence. Even though he has stated that on 23.05.2019 he went to Palani and on 25.05.2019 only he returned to Valparai, the appellant has failed to produce any valid trip sheet or any entry in Check Post, located between Valparai and Palani. Therefore, if at all the appellant/accused was not in Valparai at the relevant point of time, he should have produced any valid documentary proof to sustain his defence, since he took a specific defence of plea of alibi and he failed to do the same. Therefore, the defence of plea of alibi taken by the appellant/accused is not acceptable, since the same is not proved in the manner known to law." 
Furthermore, since there was no allegation of penetrative sexual assault, the Court observed that there was no requirement to show medical evidence of any such injury on the child. 
Accordingly the Court upheld the trial court's order of conviction by observing that the child's testimony was consistent and inspired confidence. 
"In the present case on hand, there is no eye witness except the victim child, who was 11 years at the time of occurrence and she has clearly spoken about the incident and the manner in which the offence committed by the appellant, which is cogent, consistent and trustworthy and this Court does not finds any reason to disbelieve or discord the evidence of the victim child," the Court further remarked. 
Case Title: K Ruban v. State

The Allahabad High Court last week quashed an order passed against an Uttar Pradesh Police Constable removing him from service allegedly because he entered into an argument with the Station Officer in an inebriated state.
The Bench of Justice Siddhartha Varma observed that the finding, that the Constable was in a drunken state, was arrived at simply because the petitioner was smelling of alcohol.
Calling it an absolutely erroneous decision on the part of the Enquiry Officer, the Court quashed and set aside the order dated 31.10.2009 passed by the Superintendent of Police, Lalitpur dismissing him from services.
The Court also quashed the orders passed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police, Jhansi Range, Jhansi, and the Additional Director General of Police (Telecommunications), Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow confirming his dismissal from service. 
The Court also noted that neither any urine test done nor any blood test was conducted at that point in time when it was alleged that he had misbehaved with the Station Officer in an inebriated state.
"The moment an allegation was made with regard to drunkenness, either a urine test ought to have taken place or a blood test ought to have been conducted. In the absence of these two tests, the report by the Enquiry Officer becomes erroneous," the Court added.
Still, further, the Court opined that when the Disciplinary Authority was punishing the petitioner, it should have considered the fact that the petitioner had not in any manner indulged in any activity which could be termed as "indiscipline".
Under such circumstances, the Court opined that the orders impugned cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. With this, directing that the petitioner shall be entitled to all consequential benefits, the writ petition was allowed.
Advocate Utkarsh Malviya appeared for the petitioner and Advocate Vikram Bahadur Yadav appeared for the respondents.
Case title - Dashrath Singh v. State of U.P. and Others [WRIT - A No. - 42698 of 2010]

The Delhi High Court has summoned Delhi Government’s Inspector General of Registration after expressing concern that a large volume of land and property records went missing from a Sub-Registrar office. 
Justice Prathiba M Singh also directed the Principal Secretary, Revenue of the Delhi Government to join the court proceedings on February 8, the next date of hearing.
The court observed that the function of the Sub-Registrars is for registering various documents relating to assets of the citizens and the same cannot be treated in a “cavalier and negligent manner.”
“…considering that these documents could be misused for sale-purchase transactions also raises serious concerns about the credibility and integrity of preservation of land records related to citizens,” the court said. 
The court was hearing a plea moved by an entity Monk Estates Private Limited seeking an enquiry into the missing records of execution and registration of petitioner’s land from Sub- Registrar’s office and also to re- construct the same. 
It was the petitioner’s case that it registered six sale deeds in November, 1994 in respect of certain agricultural lands and the registered copies of the registered sale deeds were obtained. However, the said original registered sale deeds were lost in 2013 and an FIR was registered. 
After applying for certified copies, the petitioner was given only one registered sale deed and a letter was issued on December 31, 2013 stating that the remaining documents were not traceable. 
Pursuant to an RTI application being moved, the Sub-Registrar’s office vide letter dated October 18, 2021 informed the petitioner that the documents were not available. An FIR was then lodged with the police on May 1, 2019 regarding the loss or non-availability of the said records.
Hearing the parties, Justice Singh noted that the fact that an FIR was registered after 14 years of delay proves that the documents “are not being kept in safe custody”, adding that a large number of officials “would be liable to be blamed for the said missing documents.”
Noting that none of the authorities appear to have be taken any action in the matter despite having knowledge of all the facts, the court ordered:
“Accordingly, Inspector General of Registration (GNCTD) shall remain present in the Court on the next date of hearing. The Principal Secretary, Revenue (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) shall also join proceedings on the next date of hearing.”
In the meanwhile, the court directed the respondent authorities to place on record the list of Sub-Registrars and other officials who were deputed in the office of the Sub-Registrar in question since January 1, 2005. 
“In addition, status of the FIR dated 1st May, 2019 shall also be placed on record by the Respondents,” the court ordered.

In a significant observation, the Allahabad High Court today observed that the disregard shown by the senior-most officials to the orders passed by the Court has grave consequences on the rule of law in the country.
The Bench of Justice Ajay Bhanot further remarked that it has repeatedly noticed the failure of the police authorities to provide instructions to the learned Government Advocate of bail applications from time to time.
"Once the police authorities have been alerted to the fact that there failure to provide instructions in time strikes at the root of law. It often leads to unjustified incarceration of an accused in jail," the Court added.

The matter before the Court
A first information report was lodged against the applicant under Section 394 IPC and the bail application of the applicant was rejected by the Special Judge (Dacoity Affected Area)/Additional Sessions Judge, Auraiya, on March 2, 2021.
Approaching the High Court with his Bail Application, the Counsel for the applicant contended that the applicant had been falsely implicated in the instant case and that the F.I.R. was lodged seven days after the incident. 
It was argued that the delay is fatal to the case of the prosecution and the applicant was not named in the F.I.R and there are no independent witnesses to the recovery and that False recovery of some articles has been shown from the applicant. 
The A.G.A could not satisfactorily dispute the aforesaid submissions from the record and he stated that he does not have any instructions from the police authorities who failed to provide instructions to the learned A.G.A. despite ample time being given for the same.
Court's observations and order
To this, the Court said that it has repeatedly noticed the failure of the police authorities to provide instructions to the learned Government Advocate of bail applications from time to time.
The Court also noted that it was assured by the learned A.G.A. in Criminal Misc. Bail Application no. 19839 of 2021, that the State Government was committed to upholding the rule of law in the State even it is taken on its face value. 
However, the Court added:
"This repeated deviation merely reflects aberrations in the system and faults on the part of individual officials who need to be appropriately counselled in this regard. It is hoped that expeditious steps are being taken by the police authorities for compliance of the directions given to the Director General of Police, U.P. Police in the above said case." 
Further, the Court directed that a copy of the order be served upon the Director-General of Police, U.P. Police through a Government Advocate. 
Importantly, the Court said:
"Courts have taken notice of the overcrowding of jails during the current pandemic situation. These circumstances shall also be factored in while considering bail applications on behalf of accused persons."
Further, looking at the merit in the submissions of the counsel for the applicant and accordingly holding that the applicant is entitled to be enlarged on bail, the Court allowed the bail application on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court below.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that the owner of the vehicle who is seeking only release of the vehicle is not liable to pay fine for the confiscated goods.
The division bench of Justice Ajay Tewari and Pankaj Jain has observed that to force the owner of the vehicle to pay the tax, penalty and fine on the goods would mean that the owner of the vehicle is also foisted with the vicarious liability of any mis-declaration/fraud by the owner of the goods despite the proviso engrafted on to Sub Section 2 of Section 130 of the CGST Act.
 The goods and conveyance were confiscated by the Tax Authorities during transit as the tax against the goods was not paid. Proceedings under Section 130 were initiated for the reason that the fine and penalty was not paid for 14 days. 
 The owner of the goods did not come forward to pay the fine and penalty, but the owner of the vehicle paid the required fine in relation to the conveyance. Even after the payment of fine by the owner of the vehicle, the authorities refused to release the conveyance on the ground that fine in lieu of confiscation of goods be also paid. Hence the present writ petition was filed by the owner of the vehicle.
 The issue raised was whether the conveyance detained by the GST Authorities can be released on payment of the fine imposed on the conveyance without payment of fine imposed on goods.
 Counsel for the department has contended that as per Sub Section 1 of Section 129 of the CGST Act on detention the goods and the vehicle can only be released on the payment of the applicable tax and penalty and the mere fact that Section 130 of CGST Act is subsequently invoked would not take away the rigour of Section 129 (1) of CGST Act. 
 It was further argued that there is no warrant for the proposition that the owner of the goods and the owner of the vehicle are two separate entities because as per her under the main Sub Section 2 of Section 130 of the CGST Act it is clear that whoever wants the goods or the vehicle to be released has to pay the tax, penalty and fine imposed for all the things i.e. to say for the goods also as well as for the conveyance also. The proviso to Sub Section 2 of Section 130 of the CGST Act would not affect this basic provision.
 The court while rejecting the contentions of the counsel of the department has held that as the owner of the vehicle and the owner of the goods were different, the owner of the vehicle cannot be considered vicariously liable for the fine and penalty levied on the goods. The owner of the vechile cannot be forced to pay the fine and penalty levied on the goods and hence the conveyance cannot be detained after the payment of such fine and penalty levied on the conveyance.

While quashing an FIR registered against an advocate for allegedly raising slogans against a Court order, the Himachal Pradesh High Court last week observed that registration of FIR without any legally admissible evidence against advocates, who are the saviour of Freedom of Speech would only dampen their spirits.
 The Bench of Justice Anoop Chitkara was hearing the plea of an Advocate named Vipul Prabhakar who was accused of raising slogans against an order of the High Court.
 Facts in brief
 On July 24, 2019, a police team, which was deputed to maintain law and order informed the Police Station about the commission of cognizable offences, which led to registration to the instant FIR. 
 As per the said information, the Investigating Officer stated that on July 24, 2019 at about 2.00 p.m. a group of lawyers raising slogans, proceeded from the side of A.G office towards CTO, Shimla. 
 Allegedly, these lawyers were raising slogans against an order passed by the High Court and since the raising slogans against the order of this Court was an offence under Sections 143 and 188, IPC, as such, the investigator registered the FIR.
 Court's observations
 Perusing the record of the case, the Court observed observed that the matter pertained to raising of slogans, however, the investigation did not reveal the identity of any such lawyer by the investigator. 
 Further, it was noted that it was also not mentioned as to what was the language of slogans and against which order of the Court, the Advocates were protesting. 
 Thus, the Court found it a fit case where the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure could be invoked to quash the proceedings mentioned above. 
 Therefore, the FIR against the Advocate was quashed and all the consequential proceedings were also quashed and set aside.
 Earlier this year, underlining that holding peaceful processions, raising slogans, would not be and cannot be an offence under India's Constitution, the Himachal Pradesh High Court had quashed an FIR filed against an Advocate under Sections 341, 143, 147, 149, 353, 504, and 506 IPC.
 The Bench of Justice Anoop Chitkara was hearing the plea of a lady Advocate and member of the Shimla District Courts Bar Association who prayed before the Court to quash the FIR, registered against him.

The Karnataka High Court has imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh each on two dental colleges for having wasted the court's time by filing "speculative" petitions seeking relief on behalf of few students who did not get admission to BDS courses, for the year 2021-2022.
 A division bench of Justice B Veerappa and Justice K.S.Hemalekha directed Venkateshwara Dental College and Hospital and KVG Dental College & Hospital to deposit the cost amount with the Advocates' Association of Bengaluru within a period of one month.
 The colleges along with few students desirous of getting admission to BDS courses had approached the court claiming that the website/portal of the Karnataka Examination Authority, which facilitates the registration to the course, was not at all open due to the reasons best known to them and therefore, petitioner-students could not register themselves in terms of the schedule announced by the Medical Counselling Committee for Mop-up round 2 counselling for BDS 2021.
 Therefore, the petitioner No.1-institutions addressed a letter to KEA, requesting the authority to permit the petitioner-students to register and facilitate their admission.
 However, since the Authority did not make their website/ portal available for the petitioner students to register on 2nd and 3rd of May for Mop-up round 2 counselling for BDS 2021, they could not register and get the admission to the Dental course. Therefore, the petitioner No.1- institutions and the petitioner-students approached the court.
 Findings:
 At the outset, the bench noted that the petitioners have not made out any statutorily enforceable right to issue a writ in the nature of mandamus and thus, they are not entitled to any relief under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution.
 Referring to the statement of objections filed by KEA, wherein it had specifically contended that for the Academic Year 2021-22 the website/portal was open for online registration process by the eligible NEET qualified students and was extended several times, the bench observed,
"The petitioners have not denied the specific averments made at paragraph-4 of the statement of objections specifying the dates on which the online registration process was open for the eligible candidates to register with the Karnataka Examination Authority nor produced any contra documents to the effect that the Karnataka State e-Information Bulletin containing the calendar of events issued is not meant for registration to BDS course for the year 2021."
 Rejecting the contention of the colleges that it approached the authority requesting to open the portal for registration the bench said, "Petitioners No.1-colleges being the Management, are not the aggrieved parties to address letter to the respondent No.3 praying to open the website/portal. It is only the students who can seek such prayer, if they are so aggrieved. Only the students who are qualified in NEET can approach the respondent No.3. The representation made by the college has no consequence."
 Noting that in the cause title of the petition the address of the students is mentioned to be the address of the college, the bench expressed,
"We are bowled over as to how the students come under the 'care of' the college of which they are not the students at all. This clearly indicates, only with an intention to fill up the vacant seats, the petitioner No.1-colleges have adopted the indirect method of getting an order from the Court and therefore, have not approached the Court with clean hands."
 It added that if the petitioner-students were really deprived of the seats to which they were eligible, they would have approached the Court, independently, by producing the documents showing the illegality committed by the respondents. However, that was not the case. "The colleges cannot step into the shoes of students and file the writ petitions."
 It held that a writ of mandamus sought by the petitioners No.1- colleges on behalf of the students who are not admitted into the college is not maintainable. "Filing and contesting these types of litigation is nothing but wasting precious public time and that of this Court and is nothing but harassing the respondent-authorities unnecessarily, by driving them to the Court and making them spend litigation expenses etc."
 Trend of Speculative litigation on the rise
 The bench observed that because of petitioners No.1-college, the petitioner-students approached the Court believing that they will obtain relief and they will get admission in the college. Thereby, the precious time of the petitioner-students was wasted, so also that of the Court, depriving other genuine litigants.
 It then opined, "The experience of this Court is that in recent years there has emerged a trend of filing speculative litigations before various Courts of law, not just in the Court of first instance, but also in the High Court as well as before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. It is the duty of the Courts to ensure that such litigations shall be weeded out at the first instance rather than allowing to be festered and thereby coming in the way of genuine litigants seeking justice treating the Court as "Temple of Justice" and to protect precious public & judicial time of the court."

While dealing with a trademark infringement suit filed by Cable News Network (CNN) news channel, the Delhi High Court has granted permanent injunction against various entities over use of identical mark 'CNN' while providing similar news services. 
Justice Pratibha M Singh also awarded Rs. 3 lakhs cost in favour of CNN news channel, observing that its rights in the mark 'CNN' were undisputed and unchallenged and that the same had been declared as a well-known mark.
"Thus, the use of an identical mark for identical services is clear infringement of the Plaintiff's rights in the 'CNN' mark. There can be no justification for the Defendants to use an identical mark," the Court said.
It was the case of the plaintiff that sometime in March, 2021, it came to know that the Defendant No.1, one Fayyaz Shaikh started running a news channel under the name 'CNN News Khabar Update Marathi'. Defendant No.2, Azhar Hussain, was shown as the Editor in Chief of the said channel. It was added that they were also using the network named 'CNN City News Network, Darwha, Yavatmal, Maharashtra.'
It was also submitted that the Defendants were also running YouTube Channels and were promoting the mark 'CNN' on their Twitter account, Instagram posts, blogs, etc. and that there was depiction of the mark 'CNN' on the YouTube Channels of the Defendants. 
In view of the identical use of the mark 'CNN' by the Defendants for an identical service i.e., news service on the internet, suit was filed by the Plaintiff. 
As per the Plaintiff, the use of the mark 'CNN' constituted infringement of its registered trademarks, passing off, etc. It was also alleged that the said use would constitute misrepresentation, impersonation, dilution and tarnishment.
Noting that the Defendants were using an identical mark for identical services, the Court observed thus:
"Even if the name of the Defendants' network is City News network, the use of the abbreviated form 'CNN' would be impermissible owing to the well-known nature of the Plaintiff's mark. Moreover, the mark 'CNN' is one which is globally well known in the field of news dissemination and media related business."
Accordingly, the Defendants were refrained from using, broadcasting, telecasting any news or any other program under the mark 'CNN' and using the mark 'CNN', in any manner, with or without any suffix or prefix for any goods or services which are cognate and allied to the Plaintiff's news services or other related services. 
"The Defendants shall also refrain from posting any tweets or uploading any videos or putting up any content on the internet using the mark/name 'CNN'," it added.
It further ordered "The use of the mark 'CNN' is clearly with knowledge of the Plaintiff's goodwill and reputation, as also, considering that the Defendants, being journalists/identical mark for identical services is clear infringement persons in the media business, are deemed to be well aware of the reputation of the Plaintiff's mark and the rights of the Plaintiff in the said mark. Accordingly, costs of Rs.3 lakhs are awarded to the Plaintiff, in terms of the relief as sought in paragraph 44(i) of the Plaint."

The Calcutta High Court has recently refused to grant relief under Section 5 of the Limitation Act to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for condonation of delay of about 302 days in filing an appeal. 
Justice Bibek Chaudhuri remarked that the government agency is not a privileged litigant and no explanation is forthcoming as to why the heads of various offices of CBI took such an unusual time to release the record of the case for the purpose of filing the appeal.
"..the Government or a Government agency is not a privileged litigant. The Government agency is required to explain the delay in the same manner like that of an ordinary litigant to get the relief of condonation of delay under Section 5 of the Limitation Act", the Court underscored. 
Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court decision in Office of the Chief Post Master General & Ors. v.  Living Media India Ltd. & Anr wherein it had been held that unless government bodies and their agencies have a reasonable explanation for the delay, there is no need to accept the usual explanation that the file was kept pending for several months/years due to considerable degree of procedural red-tape in the process.
Further opining that it has not been explained why the CBI took such an unusual time to file the appeal after the expiry of almost 302 days of limitation, the Court observed, 
"The petitioner has stated in the said paragraph different dates when the file was sent to different offices of CBI. It has not been stated why the office of various heads of office of CBI took unusual time to release the record and finally allowed the appeal to be filed after expiry of 302 days of Limitation."
Thus, the Court observed that the CBI has not been able to come up with satisfactory explanation in support of its case for condonation of delay.
Accordingly, the Court dismissed the application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act as well as the Special Leave application. 
Background 
The CBI had filed an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act for condonation of delay of 302 days in filing the appeal against the impugned judgment and order of acquittal. Furthermore, the Court was apprised that the Regional Office of the CBI at Kolkata has no authority to decide as to whether an appeal should be filed against an order of acquittal or not. The permission comes from Delhi office and only after getting the official permission, the CBI, Kolkata can file an appeal under Section 378(3) of the CrPC against an order of acquittal.
The Court was further informed that the delay had been caused in the offices of the Superintendent of Police and the Head of the Branch as a result of which there was an inordinate delay of 302 days in preferring the appeal. 
 On the other hand, the respondents argued that the explanation for condonation of delay is vague, misconceived, speculative, baseless and bereft of better or more particulars. It was further contended that official delay in according permission to the CBI to file appeal against an order of acquittal cannot be said to be a sufficient cause for delay in filing the appeal. Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court decision in State (Delhi Administration) v. Dharam Pal to contend that under Section 378 CrPC, the State Government or the Central Government shall have to file an appeal from an order of acquittal within 90 days from the date of the impugned judgement and order of acquittal being passed.

While upholding the conviction of a man who raped a minor girl in the year 2011, the Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court today remarked that in the Indian setting, the refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration, as a rule, is adding insult to injury.
The bench of Justice Rajnesh Oswal and Justice Mohan Lal also observed that in rape cases, the victim loses her face, and her value as a person. The Court further emphasized that in our conservative society, a woman and more so a young unmarried woman will not put her reputation in peril by falsely alleging forcible sexual assault.
The case in brief 
The appellant/convict had been held guilty, convicted, and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 20 years for commission of offence punishable u/s 376 RPC and was further sentenced to simple imprisonment for a period of 2 years for commission of offence punishable u/s 506 RPC.
The appellant challenged the conviction order on the ground that the prosecutrix had filed an application for registration of FIR after the lapse of more than 08 months from the date of the incident, there has been a delay in the registration of FIR which has remained unexplained
It was also argued that the prosecutrix had never mentioned in her statement recorded before the trial court that the appellant/convict had ever committed rape upon her, and that she had only stated that the appellant/convict committed "Beparadgi" upon her, which by no stretch of imagination can be construed as rape. Further, the accused also questioned the claim of the victim about being a minor.
Court's observations 
At the outset, the Court observed that the delay in lodging FIR in cases under Section 376 IPC would depend upon the facts of each case, regard being had to the trauma suffered by the prosecutrix and various other factors such as fear of social stigma.
"In the case in hand, FIR has been lodged on 04-12-2011 after a laps of about 8 months from the date of occurrence i.e. 04-04-2011. It is admitted case of the prosecution that there is a delay of about 8 months in lodging the FIR. The prosecutrix has satisfactorily explained the delay that she was under the threat of being killed by appellant/convict and therefore when her father came at home from Kashmir and enquired from her regarding her putting on flesh, she told her father that she is having child of accused in her womb," the Court remarked as it noted that the delay in the lodging of the FIR was explained by the victim.
Further, the Court stressed that the evidence of the prosecutrix does not necessarily need corroboration for sustaining the conviction of the accused where the prosecutrix had no motive to falsely implicate the accused risking her own reputation and that a young unmarried woman will not put her reputation in peril by alleging falsely about forcible sexual assault.
Against this backdrop, the Court held that the prosecutrix who is minor had no motive to falsely implicate the appellant/accused risking her own reputation in peril by alleging falsely about forcible sexual assault by the appellant.
Adverting to the second argument of the accused, the Court observed that the word "bepardagi" is Urdu vernacular word and it clearly means to undress or make someone nude. 
"The prosecutrix has testified the correctness of the contents of her statement recorded u/s 164-A Cr.pc before Judicial Magistrate during the course of investigation which clearly establishes/proves that she was subjected to the act of forcible sexual intercourse/rape by appellant/accused...Arguments advanced by Ld. Counsel for appellant/convict that the word "bepardagi" does not mean rape and the prosecutrix nowhere has stated before the trial court that she was subjected to forcible sexual intercourse/rape, in view of the cogent, credible and sterling quality of evidence led by the prosecutrix, are legally unsustainable, repelled, rejected and discarded." the Court further remarked.
Taking into account the evidence on record, the Court came to the conclusion that the date of birth of the prosecutrix was 12-12-1995 and at the time of occurrence on 04.04.2011 her date of birth when calculated comes to 15 years and about 04 months, and therefore, the prosecutrix/victim (PW-3) at the time of occurrence on 04.04.2011 was minor and under 16 years of age.
Lastly, regarding the quantum of sentence, the Court took into consideration the mitigating circumstances projected by the appellant/convict (34 years of age, married man), and while upholding the conviction, modified the sentence of 20 years rigorous imprisonment imposed upon the appellant/convict to a minimum sentence of 7 years (RI) for the commission of offence of rape u/s 376 RPC without altering the fine component of Rs. 50000/-. 
However, the sentence imposed by the trial court for commission of offence u/s 506 RPC for 2 years simple imprisonment and fine component shall remain unaltered, the Court ordered.

The Gauhati High Court has held that the three conditions stipulated under Section 37 of the NDPS Act for grant of bail to an accused person are conjunctive in nature.
Justice Sanjay Kumar Medhi ruled that all the three conditions, namely, (i) opportunity to the Public Prosecutor to oppose the bail (ii) prima facie satisfaction regarding availability of ground for believing that the accused is not guilty and (iii) he is not likely to commit any offense while on bail; are required to be fulfilled simultaneously to grant bail.
Holding that the third condition is not fulfilled in the case at hand, the Court denied bail to the applicant who had completed 267 days in custody on September 7.
It noted,
"The first condition is fulfilled and even assuming that the second condition is also fulfilled, the case records demonstrate the involvement of the accused in another case involving the NDPS Act in which he has been charge-sheeted, and he has been facing trial. Since the same is a relevant factor, this Court is of the opinion that the privilege of bail is not entitled to by the applicant." 
The Court added,
"As regards the length of detention, apart from the fact that  the offence involved is the socio economic offence, the Hon'ble Supreme court in the Sahabuddin case, as indicated above has held that the duration as an under trial prisoner has to be examined from the point of view of the interest of the society."
Background
The present matter is one of bail under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. in connection with an NDPS case involving Sections 17(b), 18(c), 20(b)(ii)(C), 21(C), 25, 27(A) and 29(1) of the NDPS Act, 1985.
Senior Advocate Bhattacharyya, appearing for the applicant, informed the Court that the applicant had completed 267 days in custody. He was arrested merely on suspicion as he was physically present by chance in the house of the prime accused, his maternal uncle.
Bhattacharyya argued that the investigation had been completed in the meantime, and the charge sheet had been filed. It was submitted before the Court that nothing incriminating had been assigned to the applicant other than his mere presence. It is further submitted that the case record would reveal that nothing has been recovered from the applicant's possession, and even during the investigation, the police remand was sought only for the prime accused. 
The only connection is a mobile phone which allegedly belonged to the applicant. However, there is nothing on record to show that any investigation was made towards examination of the call records or any other similar forensic analysis to connect the applicant with the offense, the Counsel further submitted. 
Arguing on the legal aspects, the Counsel argued that: (a) in the instant case the informant is himself the Investigating Officer and there is a legal bar in this regard; (b) the FIR itself is not admissible as it was registered after the investigation was over; (c) the applicant can at best be termed as a seizure witness and (d) the statements of the independent witnesses do not implicate the applicant. 
Additional Public Prosecutor B. Sharma questioned the maintainability that no new or fresh grounds have been stated, and the bail was rejected twice earlier, exhaustively dealing with all aspects. 
He argued that the narcotics/contraband seized and cash recovered is of a considerable quantity. It indicates that it is an organized crime involving several persons and cannot be the handiwork of a single individual. It was further contended that the FIR clearly states the applicant's name, and there are materials to suggest that there was prior information regarding the applicant coming to the place of occurrence.
On the merits of the case, it was argued that: (a) it is factually incorrect that the Informant and the Investigating Officer is the same person; (b) NDPS Act being a special enactment which deals with the socio-economic offence, the period of detention is not material; and (c) the argument that the applicant accused was present only by chance is not acceptable as the same is not a reasonable submission appealing to a prudent mind.
Findings
The Court took notice that on two earlier occasions, the applicant's bail application was rejected - one on technical terms and the other on merits. Referring to the second rejection order, the Court noted that there is no scope for fresh consideration when the matter has been elaborately discussed.
On the question of the informant and the investigator being the same person, the Court relied on Mukesh Singh v. State (2020), where it was held that, 
"In a case where the informant himself is the investigator, by that, itself cannot be said that the investigation is vitiated on the ground of bias or the like factor. The question of bias or prejudice would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Therefore, merely because the informant is the investigator, by that itself, the investigation would not suffer the vice of unfairness or bias and therefore on the sole ground that informant is the investigator, the accused is not entitled to acquittal."
On the question of a long period of detention of more than 267 days, the Court noted that it would not come to the aid of the applicant since the offence involved is a socio-economic one and also because of the consideration of the huge quantity of contraband as well as currency recovered from the place of occurrence.
In Chandrakeshwar Prasad v. the State of Bihar (2016), it was held that the right to bail cannot be an absolute one, and reasonable restrictions can be placed on them. The duration as an undertrial has to be examined from the point of view of the interest of the society. 
The Court also rejected the second submission that the FIR is not admissible as it was registered after the investigation was over, while noting that there was a GD Entry prior to the investigation. 
Case Title: Md. Mofidul Haque v. State of Assam
Read The Order

The Supreme Court observed that being short of sufficient funds to pay court fee is not a reason to condone delay in filing appeal.
In such a scenario, an appeal can be filed in terms of Section 149 CPC and thereafter the defects can be removed by paying deficit court fees.
In this case, the High Court dismissed the delay condonation applications filed under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, declining to condone a delay of 254 days to file First Appeal,on the ground that the reasons assigned for the condonation were not sufficient reasons for condonation of the delay. The only reason assigned for the delay was that he was not having sufficient funds to pay the court fee.
In appeal, the court noted the provisions of Section 149 CPC which deals with the power to make up deficiency of Court Fees.- Where the whole or any part of any fee prescribed for any document by the law for the time being in force relating to court fees has not been paid, the Court may, in its discretion, at any stage, allow the person, by whom such fee is payable, to pay the whole or part, as the case may be, of such court-fee; and upon such payment the document, in respect of which such fee is payable, shall have the same force and effect as if such fee had been paid in the first instance
While upholding the High Court order, the bench made the following observations
There must be a reasonable explanation for the delay.
An appeal has to be filed within the stipulated period, prescribed under the law. Belated appeals can only be condoned, when sufficient reason is shown before the court for the delay. The appellant who seeks condonation of delay therefore must explain the delay of each day. It is true that the courts should not be pedantic in their approach while condoning the delay, and explanation of each day’s delay should not be taken literally, but the fact remains that there must be a reasonable explanation for the delay.
 There is provision under the law for filing a defective appeal
In any case, even it is presumed for the sake of argument that the appellant was short of funds, at the relevant point of time and was not able to pay court fee, nothing barred him from filing the appeal as there is provision under the law for filing a defective appeal, i.e., an appeal which is deficient as far as court fee is concerned, provided the court fee is paid within the time given by the Court..We find that the High Court was right in dismissing Section 5 application of the appellant as insufficient funds could not have been a sufficient ground for condonation of delay, under the facts and circumstance of the case. It would have been entirely a different matter had the appellant filed an appeal in terms of Section 149 CPC and thereafter removed the defects by paying deficit court fees. This has evidently not been done.
The court also considered the case on merits also and dismissed the appeal.

Himachal Pradesh Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, 1972 ; Section 118 - The whole purpose of Section 118 of the 1972 Act is to protect agriculturists with small holdings. Land in Himachal Pradesh cannot be transferred to a nonagriculturist, and this is with a purpose. The purpose is to save the small agricultural holding of poor persons and also to check the rampant conversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes. A person who is not an agriculturist can only purchase land in Himachal Pradesh with the permission of the State Government. The Government is expected to examine from a case to case basis whether such permission can be given or not - By merely assigning rights to an agriculturist, who will be using the land for a purpose other than agriculture, would defeat the purpose of this Act.

The Bombay High Court bench of Justice N.R. Borkar and Justice K.R.

The Bombay High Court bench of Justice N.R. Borkar and Justice K.R. Shriram has held that after four years of expiry from the end of the relevant assessment year, only the Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or Principal Commissioner or Commissioner (PCIT) can accord the approval to the reassessment notice and not the Additional Commissioner of Income Tax (ACIT).
The petitioner/assessee has challenged the reassessment notice issued under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for Assessment Year 2015-2016 on the grounds that the approval obtained for issuing the notice under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 was not in accordance with the mandate of Section 151 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 as the approval was from the Additional Commissioner of Income Tax instead of the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax.
 For the purposes of Section 151 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, no reassessment notice shall be issued under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 by an Assessing Officer, after the expiry of a period of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year, unless the Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or Principal Commissioner or Commissioner is satisfied, for the reasons recorded by the Assessing Officer, that it is a fit case for the issue of such a notice.
 The petitioner submitted that, as per Section 151 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, as four years had elapsed at the time of reopening, the sanction was required to be obtained from the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax and, since the sanction had not been obtained from the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax, the notice issued was bad in law. The sanction granted itself indicates non-application of mind.
 The respondent/department relied upon a letter dated March 18, 2021, issued by one income tax officer, who had given an opinion to the Additional Commissioner of Income Tax that, in view of the Taxation and other Laws (Relaxation of Certain Provisions) Act, 2020 (Relaxation Act), limitations under provisions of Section 151 (1) and Section 151 (2), which were originally due to expire on March 31, 2020, stand extended to March 31, 2021. 
 According to the Income Tax Officer, the statutory approval for the issuance of a notice under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the Assessment Year 2015-2016 may be given by the Range Head. The Income Tax Officer was only conveying the view of the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax because the letter had been issued on the letterhead of the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax.
 The court said, "even if for a moment we agree with the view expressed by the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax, it still applies to only cases where the limitation was expiring on March 31st, 2020. In the case at hand, the assessment year is 2015-2016 and, therefore, the six years limitation will expire only on 31st March 2022. Certainly, therefore, the Relaxation Act provisions may not be applicable. In any event, the time to issue notice may have been extended, but that would not amount to amending the provisions of Section 151 of the Act."

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently held that the freedom of speech and expression cannot be stretched to such a limit as to allow an individual to call Kashmir an occupancy of the military or to say that the people of Kashmir are being held as slaves.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently held that the freedom of speech and expression cannot be stretched to such a limit as to allow an individual to call Kashmir an occupancy of the military or to say that the people of Kashmir are being held as slaves.
 A bench comprising Justice Sanjay Dhar observed:
 "In my opinion, the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under the Constitution cannot be stretched to such a limit as to allow a person to question the status of a part of the Country or its people. It is one thing to criticize the Government for its negligence and express outrage on the violation of human rights of the people but it is quite another to advocate that the people of a particular part of the Country are slaves of the Government of India or that they are under occupation of armed forces of the Country."
 The observations was made while dismissing the petition filed by Advocate Muzamil Butt, seeking quashing of the FIR against him under Section 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The petitioner was booked in 2018 for posting on Facebook certain comments regarding the killings of six civilians in a blast at a gunfight site at Laroo Village in Kulgam that had triggered outrage across Kashmir.
In his Facebook post, the petitioner among other things, said: "For the first time in my life, I felt broken and weak and I could acknowledge that we are slaves and slaves have no life of their own...It reflects on those heartless structures that celebrate occupation of military bonhomie in cozy champagne circuits and page three parties of Gupkar".
 Justice Dhar opined that the petitioner, who happens to be an advocate, can very well understand the import of these expressions. The bench observed,
 "By making these comments, he is certainly advocating and supporting the claim that Jammu and Kashmir is not a part of India and that it is occupied by Indian military with the people having being (been) reduced to the status of slaves. Thus, he is questioning the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country."
 The bench observed that by uploading these posts, the petitioner has crossed the "Lakshman Rekha" which demarcates the freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution of India from the reasonable restrictions imposed on such freedom on the ground of sovereignty and integrity of India and is hence liable to face the law of the land.
 Adjudicating on the matter the bench found it worthwhile to explain that the expression of outrage at the negligence and inhuman attitude of the security forces, police and establishment would come within the ambit of freedom of expression of an individual, which includes the freedom to criticize the government of the day as it is permissible under law, but the same may not be the position if an individual questions the fact of a state being a part of the country by using the expressions 'occupation of military' or the people being 'slaves'.
 Discussing the subject the bench further observed that the intention of a person can be gathered from the words spoken or written or other expressions and the expressions used by the petitioner, who happens to be a law knowing person, clearly show that he intended to advocate a particular ideology which supports the claim of secession of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral part of India. This act of the petitioner, therefore, prima facie, falls within the definition of 'unlawful activity' as contained in Section 2(o) of the [Unlawful Activities (Prevention)] Act punishable under Section 13 of the Act", the bench recorded.
 For the forgoing reasons, the Court said it cannot be stated that no offence is made out from the contents of the impugned FIR and thus it is not a fit case to exercise power under Section 482 CrPC.
 Case Title: Muzamil Butt Vs State of J&K

A motorcycle rider cannot be held even partially responsible for ramming into a stationary tempo under the Motor Vehicle's Act if the offending vehicle's parking lights were off, the Bombay High Court Aurangabad bench held.
 The court enhanced the 13 lakh compensation awarded by the Tribunal and held that the biker's kin are entitled to Rs. 39,51,256 compensation along-with 6% interest from the date of filing of claim petition till its realisation.
 "I am setting aside the observations of the Tribunal that, there was 50% contributory negligence of the deceased in the said accident and I am holding that, driver of the offending tempo is sole responsible for the occurred accident," the bench held while doubling the compensation amount awarded to the 46-year-old biker's kin. 
 Justice SG Dige further observed, "When there is specific rule in respect of taking precautions by stationary vehicle, if such precautions are not taken by the driver/owner of stationary vehicle then liability cannot be shifted on motorcycle rider." 
 The bench was dealing with an appeal filed by the bike rider's kin – wife and two minor sons- seeking to enhance compensation awarded by Member of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Latur. In 2009 at 10:00 p.m. deceased Mohanrao Narharrao Salunke rammed into a stationary tempo on the Latur Highway and succumbed to his injuries during treatment. 
 His lawyer argued that the tribunal has wrongly held the rider guilty of 50% contributory negligence. He submitted that the tempo was in the middle of the road, it was dark and the tempo's tail lights were not on. Therefore there was no indication to other vehicles that there was a problem. Moreover, no compensation was awarded under the non-pecuniary heads or for future prospects and consortium. 
 The respondents argued that the deceased was riding the motorcycle at a high and excessive speed. There was headlight on the motorcycle. In that headlight the deceased could have seen the stationed offending tempo but due to high speed of motorcycle deceased dashed into the offending tempo.
 Justice SG Dige observed that in the absence of the offending tempo driver switching on his parking lights, liability of contributory accident cannot be fastened on the deceased bike rider for failing to see the tempo with his motorcycle headlight.
 Switching on parking lights in the night is compulsory for all stationary vehicles on the road according to Rule 109, of the Central Motor Vehicles rules, 1989, the court noted. 
 The judge said he was "unable to understand" findings of contributory negligence given by the Tribunal against the deceased no tail lamps or the indicators of offending tempo were put on or no proper precautions were taken by the driver of the offending tempo, to give signal to the other vehicles to show that, the offending tempo was stationed on the road.
 "It has come on record that, no such parking lights were put on the offending tempo, so liability of contributory accident cannot be fastened on the deceased by holding that, he should have seen the stationed tempo under the headlight of motorcycle. When there is specific rule in respect of taking precautions by stationary vehicle, if such precautions are not taken by the driver/owner of stationary vehicle then liability cannot be shifted on motorcycle rider."
 Case Title: Mohini Mohanrao Salunke and Ors. VERSUS Ramdas Hanumant Jadhav and Ors.

The Delhi High Court has dismissed a candidate's plea seeking appointment as a judicial officer against the unfilled vacancies which were reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes candidates in the Delhi Higher Judicial Service Examination - 2022.
A division bench of Justice Vibhu Bakhru and Justice Amit Mahajan observed that the petitioner candidate does not have any indefeasible right to be appointed to the higher judicial service and that he cannot, as a matter of right, claim that the vacancies reserved for SC/ST candidates be de-reserved.
The bench dismissed the plea moved by Rabindra Tiwary, who was seeking appointment in the higher judicial service on a supernumerary vacancy. Besides seeking de-reservation of the vacancies reserved for SC/ST candidates, Tiwary had also prayed that he be considered for appointment as a person belonging to the Economically Weaker Section (EWS). However, the advertisement did not contain reservation for the EWS category.
The final results of the interview were declared on November 10, 2022 and Tiwary was at serial number 37 in the merit list. However, he was not entitled to appointment as the selection was only for 32 vacancies for general candidates.
The counsel appearing for Tiwari submitted that the vacancies reserved for ST candidates have not been filled up for a long time and therefore are required to be de-reserved. 
He also challenged the award of additional 1.5 marks to some candidates, who had earlier made a representation to the high court. One of the three unsuccessful candidates qualified in the exam after awarding of additional marks. 
Denying relief to Tiwary, the bench said that even though his position in the order of merit would improve from rank 37 to rank 36 after the grant of additional marks, the same would not result in him being included in the select list of 32 candidates falling in general category.
Referring on Kulwinder Pal Singh and Anr. v. State of Punjab and Ors, the bench said the Supreme Court has considered the provisions of Section 7 of the Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes (Reservation in Services) Act, 2006.
"Sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the said Act expressly provided that there would be no de-reservation of any reserved category by any appointing authority in any establishment. However, Sub-section (2) of Section 7 of the said Act enabled the appointing authority to refer the vacancies to the Department of Welfare of Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes for de-reservation, if the appointing authority deemed it necessary in public interest to fill up the said vacancies," it added.
The court said it is unable to accept that any order or direction is required to be issued for undertaking any exercise for de-reservation of vacancies reserved for candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes /Scheduled Tribes.
“In the event any such de-reservation of reserved vacancies is considered necessary by the respondents, on account of the same remaining unfilled over a long period of time, for want of the candidates meeting the qualifying criteria, the respondents may undertake the exercise for de-reserving such vacancies. In the event any such vacancies are de-reserved, the same would be available for being filled pursuant to the selection exercise conducted in the future. In any view, such vacancies cannot be made available for the selection process that commenced pursuant to the impugned advertisement,” the court said.
The bench also said that the vacancies, as advertised by the impugned notification, cannot be increased by diverting vacancies earmarked for the reserved category.
The court also rejected Tiwary’s contention that he was entitled to be considered for appointment as he belonged to the EWS category. The court said that the impugned advertisement did not contain any reservation for the said category.
“The petition is unmerited and, accordingly, dismissed,” the bench said.
Senior Advocate Ajit Kumar Sinha and Advocates Niraj Kumar Mishra, Manoj Jha and Parul represented the petitioner.
Advocate Avnish Ahlawat, represented the GNCTD
Dr Amit George represented the Delhi High Court.
Title: RABINDRA TIWARY v. LT. GOVERNOR, GOVT. OF NCT OF DELHI & ANR.

The Kerala High Court recently held that principles of res judicata and constructive res judicata would squarely apply not just to civil proceedings but to criminal proceedings as well.
Justice A. Badharudeen was hearing a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to quash a complaint pending before Magistrate Court, where she was alleged to have committed offences under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 for dishonour of two cheques worth Rs.15,00,000/- and Rs.11,00,000/-. 
The main contention of the petitioner in the case was that the complainant suffers from mental insanity. To emphasise this point, the petitioner drew attention of the court to the medical certificate produced by the complainant in another case where he was booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 and had applied for bail, pleading the ground of mental instability. The petitioner argued that since a mentally ill person is not capable of entering into a contract, there could be no transaction between the petitioner and complainant.
The above contention was vehemently opposed by the counsel for the complainant, who stated that the complainant was diagnosed with bipolar affective mental disorder and was under treatment for episodic psychiatric illness for more than 8 years. However, it was also submitted that the complainant had approached the Kerala High Court for quashing the complaint against him on the ground of mental instability and the same was rejected. The counsel averred that the complainant was now facing trial in the NDPS case as an ordinary person and court records would show the same.
The court observed that there was no convincing material to show that the complainant was mentally ill and did not have the capacity to contract. The court accepted the specific contention of the complainant that the petition was barred by res judicata or by constructive res judicata as the complainant had earlier raised the contention regarding mental disorder before the same court for quashing of a complaint against him in an NDPS case. The previous petition was dismissed by the court in an earlier order. Since the earlier petition was dismissed, it is to be assumed that the plea of mental insanity was considered in the negative by the court. In such circumstances, the very same contention is barred by res judicata or constructive res judicata, the court observed.
The court relied on the decision of the Apex Court in P.Reghuthaman v. State of Kerala & Ors [Manu/KE/0880/2016] to observed that that principles of res judicata and constructive res judicata would apply to criminal proceedings also.
“Therefore, the law is well settled that the principles of res judicata and constructive res judicata would squarely apply in criminal proceedings as well, and it is equally settled that where a person, who is convicted or acquitted, not to be tried for same offence since the said trial is barred under Section 300 of Cr.P.C. Further the same is double jeopardy, which is prohibited” 
The court concluded that since the current petition was filed on the ground of the mental insanity of the complainant and since the same ground had already been contended before the court in an earlier petition and had been dismissed, the current petition would fail too as it would be hit by the principle of res judicata.
Cause Title: Mrs. Sasikala Menon V. State of Kerala and Another

The Gujarat High Court recently permitted an American Citizen of Indian origin, who had moved a habeas corpus petition seeking custody of her daughters from her husband, to withdraw the plea while observing that every party has a "right" to withdraw the proceedings.
It however hoped, that since the matter involved two minor children, the parties will act in their best interest.
"While permitting withdrawal, which is the right of every party, this Court is of the opinion that to both the parties need to act in the best interest of their children and it is therefore desirable for them to attempt an amicable settlement," Justice Sonia Gokani and Justice Mauna Bhatt observed. 
The petition was filed by the mother who was aggrieved by the alleged contravention of the order passed by the Superior Court of New Jersey which granted in-person parenting time to the Petitioner from 30th January 2022 to 27th February 2022. Accordingly, the Petitioner also sought a writ of mandamus directing the Respondents No. 1-3 to hand over the custody of Respondents 3.1 and 3.2 (the daughters) in the interest of justice.
 The Bench while noting that arrangements had been made for the weekend for the mother to meet the children, expressed the desire that the parties venture forth into an amicable settlement of their disputes for the welfare of the children. However, the mediation conducted between the parties yielded no results. 
Thereafter, the Respondent alleged that the Petitioner is not cooperating in the process of getting the Overseas Citizenship of India Card and this may become the reason for the process of issuance of OCI Card not to sail through smoothly.
 Keeping in view all these issues, the Bench had scheduled the matter for final hearing but the Petitioner sought withdrawal of the petition and wanted to take recourse to legal proceedings in the United States. This was strongly objected to by the Respondent party by alleging that this was done to derail the process of the OCI card and to ensure that the children do not remain in India.
 The Bench however observed that the custody of both the daughter by way of a temporary restrain was denied by the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Middlesex County on 06.10.2021. Even as the Petitioner withdrew the habeas corpus plea, the Bench emphasised that the parties settle the dispute amicably in the best interest of the child.
 Accordingly, it was directed that the Family Court expedite the proceedings considering the age of the children while the parties would be at liberty to request and inform the concerned authorities issuing the OCI card of the pendency of the litigation between them. The Petitioner was ordered to cooperate in the process of the issuance of OCI card.
